I've spent a lot of time thinking about *Abundance*. There are two Abundance Agendas. One is what Klein and Thompson laid out in their book, a rather narrow attempt at redefining the way the Democratic party views a certain set of issues. The other is the hype machine created by their book and the (seemingly) countless reviews, ranging from the fawning (see Noah Smith, Matt Yglesias, etc.) and the damning (see Zephyr Teachout, etc.). 

If you count meta-analysis, there's a lot to *Abundance*. The meta-analysis clearly counts; Klein and Thompson didn't write a self-contained book, but clearly want to take an active role in shaping the Democratic party's future. There's a real opening here; while most Democratic national figures of note are busy resisting Trump, I feel (or at least hope) there's a widespread awareness that mere resistance won't satisfy the electorate in 2028 (though it might in the 2026 midterms). Maybe another time I'll do a deep dive into the (laughably) numerous 2028 potential candidates, but right now I'd argue we could place most of the candidates who have started to develop an ideological plank for 2028 (this would exclude un-ideological candidates like Ossoff, Beshear, or Harris) can be placed on a spectrum between Matt Yglesias/Noah Smith-style centrist Abundance messaging or AOC/Bernie-style fight-the-oligarchy messaging. All this is to say that this *matters*, no matter the daily chaos of the Trump administration. 

This means the argument Thompson and Klein lay out needs to be aggressively interrogated. The main tenets of *Abundance*, to me, are the following:
* Democrats lost the 2024 election because they didn't implement the policies that Joe Biden passed fast enough (inflation and the electorate's ignorance of what Biden sought to build result from this).
* Democrats also lost the 2024 election because of the failure of local and state governance in Blue areas, mainly because housing is too expensive in our most productive geographies.
* Democrats are backwards-looking, they need to be forwards-looking.
* Democrats need to try to steer the advancement of technology to better humanity's lot, *not* stick their heads in the sand.

There's also an energy part of Abundance, but Klein and Thompson don't center it in their book/the resulting hype tour, so I won't center it here. Some of those claims are much bolder than they appear, and the empirical evidence Klein and Thompson provide is very uneven. In this post, I want to make two big points. 

First, it is *not* clear that Democrats lost in 2024 because of housing affordability or, more broadly, because of the failure of Blue State governance. This is a critical point, as it is the underlying assumption for centering Abundance. If it is not true that housing affordability was a prominent factor in determining the 2024 election, then Klein and Thompson have a gaping hole in their agenda. **There can be no future Democratic party agenda which does not address why Democrats lost in 2024.** 

Second, and relatedly, Klein and Thompson implicitly assume that Democrats aren't currently aligned with Abundance. A story broke last week that Kamala Harris is trying to rebrand herself; part of this rebranding was calling Klein to talk about Abundance. This got me thinking: wasn't Harris's platform in 2024 the most explicitly pro-housing Presidential platform in modern history? More broadly, YIMBY thinking appears to be deeply popular among progressives, especially if we look to elected leaders in the very places that Klein and Thompson decry as NIMBY backwaters (SF, NYC, Boston, etc.). If Klein and Thompson position themselves as if they're trying to shift how Democratic elites think about housing, what happpens if Democratic elites are already where Klein and Thompson are?
