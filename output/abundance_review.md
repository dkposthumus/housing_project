I've spent a lot of time thinking about *Abundance*. Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson have seemingly created their own hype machine, where a book light on substance (coming in at only 200 pages!) and original ideas/argumentation has somehow captured the attention of every center-left Substack writer and reader. A lot of this commentary, in my mind, is meta; progressives and leftists are loathe to support ideas coming from voices positioned closer to the center, and this triggered a rally-around-the-flag movement from the 'true' moderates, namely Matt Yglesias and Noah Smith. 

My reading of *Abundance* is not that it is neoliberal shilling or that it is some revelatory piece of work. Instead, I think Klein and Thompson have produced a set of interesting proposals that a wing of the Democratic party should pick up and run with while we're in opposition to the Trump administration. Then, in 2028, these ideas should form a key part of the platform for whomever is the Democratic presidential candidate. That's it. 

This isn't the reading Klein and Thompson wanted; they state very clearly that they want this book to help enlargen and reframe how liberals view political economy. This is a daunting task, and requires some legwork which I don't think they do, or even attempt to do. If you want to introduce a new paradigm of thinking and motivate this paradigm change, you need to convincingly establish why the current paradigm is broken. To demonstrate that the current paradigm is broken, you need to establish what the current paradigm is.

First, Klein and Thompson don't establish what Democrats' current paradigm is. To be fair, it is pretty clear Democrats aren't operating under a coherent ideological framework. Harris's approach to housing policy after she took over as nominee makes that clear. Yes, she want to rapidly construct housing, but she also made moves to subsidize demand for housing and didn't make clear how she would politically achieve the desired explosion in housing construction. That said, the Biden administration *did* operate under a pretty coherent ideology. Bidenomics was real, and it was a paradigm shift. In fact, the motivations for Bidenomics were largely the same as the motivations for 'abundance'. Political constraints hemmed in Biden on housing, but it's difficult for me to imagine a better embodiment of supply-side progressivism than the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Klein and Thompson are quiet on Bidenomics; in fact, I'm not sure they address it at all. Maybe this is a political omission that it failed, but it feels ominous. Their basic diagnosis is that Biden and his team did a great job pushing through supply-side legislative achievements; these legislative achievements didn't translate into real economy achievements, however, because of hobbled US state capacity. I buy this argument; there's a wealth of evidence that voters didn't feel the effects of a great many of Biden's domestic policy achievements, leaving their only firsthand interaction with Bidenomics elevated inflation. Yet, if the main shortcoming of the current paradigm of liberal political economy is *process*, then why do we need to engineer some dramatic break from recent history?

This is one of the core problems of the book -- it's never clear who the book is for. YIMBYism feels like a preponderant force in center-left politics at all levels. Cambridge, MA and Berkeley, CA are pushing hard to remove all zoning (successfully in the former). SF's former mayor London Breed was widely touted by YIMBYs, only to be replaced by fellow YIMBY Daniel Lurie. Most of SF is represented in CA's state senate by Scott Wiener, one of the most nationally-renowned YIMBYs. Aaron Peskin is an anomaly, and his brand of progressive NIMBYism is what Klein and Thompson take to still be the norm (a relic of the 1970s perhaps). Klein and Thompson, instead, focus on the outcomes in places like San Francisco and California, rather than the process. But it's an open question they shoul have to answer: how come YIMBYs are dominant in SF local government and state government, but we can't build anything in San Francisco?
