Second, and relatedly, Klein and Thompson implicitly assume that Democrats aren't currently aligned with Abundance. A story broke last week that Kamala Harris is trying to rebrand herself; part of this rebranding was calling Klein to talk about Abundance. This got me thinking: wasn't Harris's platform in 2024 the most explicitly pro-housing Presidential platform in modern history? More broadly, YIMBY thinking appears to be deeply popular among progressives, especially if we look to elected leaders in the very places that Klein and Thompson decry as NIMBY backwaters (SF, NYC, Boston, etc.). If Klein and Thompson position themselves as if they're trying to shift how Democratic elites think about housing, what happpens if Democratic elites are already where Klein and Thompson are?
