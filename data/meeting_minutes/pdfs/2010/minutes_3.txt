6.         Commission Comments/Questions
Inquiries/Announcements.  Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
Future Meetings/Agendas.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Lee:
- I was walking down the Fillmore Street and ran into a neighborhood activist -- actually, they commented on the Ralph Lauren store approved and mentioned that they havenât met their conditions of approval, and I would like the staff to give us a status report on why they have not met their obligations. Secondly, I want to thank David, the recently signed a sister city agreement. The Mayor of Vermont went over to the Planning Department where he was approached -- touched by the presentation regarding the planning proposal.
Commissioner Borden:
-  I know that they are stepping up at the manager said that they had to work hard to get rid of this person that they felt embodied the culture of what Ralph Lauren is about, and the intent they want to fill. I happen to have that same conversation on Saturday with the new manager who was specifically excited about the opportunity. The question I have related to the minutes, it was just a question. I notice that when we're under Commissioner' s comments and matters, what we say is all spelled out under the regular items, it is not. It does not need to be, but I wanted to know what the protocol was. You have all of the different speakers for it or in opposition. It does not mention that we spoke on it.
Commission Secretary:
- Commissioners, your minutes are action minutes. They will never include your deliberation.It only includes whatever action-- five hours of deliberation will include the action you finally take. That is what the minutes will show.
Commissioner Antonini:
-  I know that this is a discussion for another day, but calendaring is a difficult problem. In terms of the calendar, for next year, there may be a possibility that maybe the Commissioners will see fit in changing the calendar and we can start a little earlier in the day. It is unfortunate today that a couple of things came up, and that is why things got moved back on the calendar. Hopefully we can do some things to remedy that. We had a special order of business, and even though people have had time to speak about their concerns, they were not here to speak about them, even though time is certain, we can start these items at 5:30 instead of -- if not earlier.
Commissioner Moore:
-I wanted to share a call I got yesterday about an ongoing unacceptable behavior regarding  the buses run by the Academy of Art University, I would like to know to what extent they have been sanctioned, and I like to know what policies they have for the fact that they are still running almost empty. I would like to request a status report from staff. The buses are getting larger, and only the fact that they are empty remains. I would like the staff to give us an update on enforcement, following up something we have talked about for quite some time.
-The second thing is why we are sitting here. I wanted to bring to everybody's attention, the invitation I received as a private citizen to the Park and Recreation Commission who is holding a meeting on cultivating the future of San Francisco. It would have been nice if we had been informed about that unfortunately, we cannot participate in the meeting. Perhaps we can get a de-brief so that we are on the same page.
Commissioner Sugaya:
- Commissioner Moore got ahead of me here I also wanted to request a status report on the Academy of Art University. I believe we got a good report from the Director in March,.
- President Miguel had handed out information, and it was done by the Urban Land Institute. There is an interesting side bar that I will read really quickly. Rental housing lowers overall housing costs in San Francisco County. Although San Francisco County is associated with high housing costs, the data published in this report suggest that housing is more affordable there than in the other five counties in the Bay Area -- since 62% of San Franciscans rent their homes, is below the Bay Area average. 37% of the households are renters. Renting is less expensive than owning a home and a large number of renters keeps average housing costs lower than the average. I thought that was an interesting side bar to the report.
Commissioner Borden:
-People have been asking about the hotel on 3155 Scott Street. It is a community housing partnership-youth center, a notice that went out to the public on intent for funding from the Mayorâs Office. I just don't know what happen I would like to have a report.
Director Rahaim:
-I don' t know either. We will check it out.
President Miguel:
-I did handout two publications from the Urban Land Institute. The other Bay Area Guardian, I found the reading in both of them to be extremely interesting. But I would like to comment on the Housing Action Coalition event a couple of weeks ago. Their annual breakfast on housing was extremely well done. There were some materials on that, I noted in the American Planning Association, they are planning an achievement award. The Visitacion Valley design for development mentioned Tom Evansâ development agency, FranK Martin from Visitacion Valley a landmark alliance, and also they are from Sarah Dennis-Phillips the San Francisco Planning Department. it was a very nice mention to have.
-For those that were here for the morning hearing and the Commissioners, just to let you know, at the present time, we are exploring an earlier start time for the June 3rd. joint hearing.There are notice requirements that differ between the Planning Commission and the Redevelopment Commission. Those are being checked out to see that everything is in confirmation. Alternative spaces are being checked out. Once that is together, the order of the agenda and items will be put together. The start times and everything might change slightly.  We might know more before we leave here this evening.
Commission Secretary:
- Just to add to that because we anticipated starting a joint hearing after 5:00, we set up a very light calendar for the Planning Commission at its regular time. In light of this new possibility, I would say that we probably need to continue those items to further dates.
Commissioner Miguel:
-  We will know that by next Thursday.
7.         Directorâs Announcements
Director Rahaim:
- I went to a meeting to Cathedral Hill with Michael Jacinto, and there was a very large turnout, probably 150 people or so talking about various projects. Most of the questions were related about CPMC, so we had a number of questions and fairly lively dialogue. They asked for a follow-up meeting.
-  David Alumbaugh had one announcement he wanted to make about a clarification of something that happened last week.
David Alumbaugh:
- There were questions about the closure of 24th, and I think we might have misled folks. I believe it was reported that that item was off the table. The public workshop is on April 8 to discuss the issue of what to do from the idea that it has come from the community and business district. We're closing the street, and we have committed -- we will take the ideas that came from the workshop. We will take them back and explore the viability of any of them. We' re having a public dialogue in June. I just wanted to clarify that.

At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public comment, the commission is limited to:
(1)  responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or
(2)  requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or
(3)directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.  (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))
