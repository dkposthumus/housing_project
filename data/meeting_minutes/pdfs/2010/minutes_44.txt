Commissioner Miguel:
I would like to introduce to everyone our newest Commissioner, the Ports' lostour gain, Rodney Fong. Many of you worked with him over the years and -- it is a 
pleasure to have a long time San Francisco family represented here, someone who 
has â has been active within the city government and has been active within the 
business interests of the city and understands business and manages the general 
tourist business that is thebackbone of some of our economy. We welcome you Rodney.
Commissioner Fong:
Thank you so much. I'm absolutely thankful to serve the City, looking forward to 
working with you and sharing comments, sharing thoughts about shaping San 
Francisco. So, looking forward to it, honored. Thank you so much.
Commissioner Sugaya:
On November 18th, there was item before this Commission regarding a restaurant 
that wanted to have amplified music, and it was an Italian restaurant and the 
music was going to enhance the PRA singing that took place there. We were I 
believe all in a good mood. It was in that context that I made the remarks that 
are now is the subject of Supervisor Allioto Pierâs. I supposed that comment was 
offensive to those with an Italian Heritage. Although it was not meant to be a 
disparaging comment, I see now it was very inappropriate. For that I apologize 
to you, to those in the audience at the time and to others who have either heard 
about what I said oar seen it on S.F.G.T.V. I do not take my responsibilities as 
a City Commissioner lightly, and in am no stranger to discrimination and the 
derogatory words of others. We represent the entire City and should treat 
members of the public with the respect they deserve. I truly regret making my 
comment and hope you and the community will accept this apology.  This letter 
was sent to Supervisor Alliot-Pierâs Office, also a copy was delivered to 
President David Chiu's office as well.
Commissioner Antonini:
I want to mention, I met with project sponsors last week on the project that 
will be before us next  2201 Market Street, if I'm not mistaken on the address 
which was the former S.N.C. Ford. It was informative and helpful to get a 
preview of what will be before us, and I also had meeting with the Bicycle 
Coalition on their plans for the next number of years.  I have the pleasure of 
having lunch with the new Supervisor of District 10, mel leah kohn and last 
night, with the Fire Department, and there was a rather large and well 
represented group on a discussion chaired by our Director on the Housing 
Element. That worked out very well.
Commissioner Miguel:
The reason for cancelling the January 6th meeting is because theDepartment will 
be on hiatus the last week of the year and preparation would be impossible.
4.         
Directorâs Announcements
Director Rahaim:
I will also on behalf of staff and the department welcome Commissioner Fong to 
the Commission. We look forward to working with you.
A couple of other announcements, last night, I convened a group of interested 
parties on the Housing Element as President Miguel mentioned. Thank you for 
coming to that meeting. It was a lively discussion. There was maybe 20-25 people 
and we committed to getting out the third draft of the Housing Element in about 
a month. Convening a group again to have what I hope would be the final 
discussion on the details of the element in order for your consideration in 
February and March. That's the current schedule that we're hoping for the 
element, and this is the 2009 Housing Element and we're three weeks away from 
2011 and concerned about getting this thing moved along. A reminder on Saturday 
morning the Department is hosting a meeting for interested parties on our -- 
what we call our action plan, kind of the final stage of our reform process and 
we will be  reviewing in detail our proposed development review process  that 
was the subject of your memo last week. We have a meeting at 10:00 A.M. Saturday 
at the Department and we will be putting that on your calendar in January for a 
public hearing as well.
5.         Review 
of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and 
Historic Preservation Commission.
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS REPORT:
At the Land Use Committee, two items were heard:
·Conditional Use (CU) for Other Entertainment in the Van Ness SUD & RC Districts 
by supervisor Alioto-Pier.  
This commission heard this item last week and recommended approval.  Staff also 
recommended a modification to change the controls that govern uses in RC 
districts.  Staff recommended using C-2 use controls as had been done prior to 
2008.  While you agreed with the Supervisorâs intent to regulate âother 
entertainment,â you asked for more time to consider the proposed RC change.  
Coincidentally, we have a second ordinance before you this week sponsored by 
Supervisor Mirkarimi that amends these two sections and this will allow us to 
consider that change again this week.  At the Land use hearing on Monday, 
Supervisor Alioto-Pier modified her ordinance to require public notice under 
Section 312 for âother entertainmentâ uses in this area.  Supervisor Alioto-Pier 
and the Land Use Committee agreed to sever the ordinance so that the additional 
controls for âother entertainmentâ could move forward to the full Board but 
would allow the committee to wait on the decision about the governing use 
controls in the RC district until you had your discussion today.
·CEQA 
Appeal Reform.  
The Land Use Committee also considered an ordinance to add regulations to the 
Administrative Code that would specify procedures for appeals of neg decs and 
exemptions.  The proposed ordinance was considered by this Commission on 
6/24/10.  At that time you recommended 11 modifications.  The HPC considered the 
legislation on 6/16 and 7/7 at which point they concurred with your 
recommendations and added 4 additional considerations.  This was the fourth 
hearing of the item and continued at the Land Use Committee.  This week the item 
was continued again.  The ordinance had been amended to address the concerns of 
this commission and the Historic Preservation Commission.  Since youâve heard 
the ordinance, it has been amended such that appellants are not required to have 
âprior participationâ in order to maintain appeal rights.  Some of the major 
features of the ordinance as currently drafted include the following:Appeal Deadlines:  for EIR â 20 days after certification; for appeals of 
a neg dec â 20 days after adoption by the Planning Commission; for exemptions â 
20 days after each noticed opportunity OR if no notice is provided, within 20 
days of final discretionary permit.This last question of setting the appeal 
deadline at 20 days after final discretionary permit is raising concern that 
appeals could be valid with the addition of a minor permit, well after 
construction is underway for the project.Appeal Procedures:  The 
City may not approve or issue permits during an appeal (except to mitigate a 
hazard); the Board must hold an appeal hearing within 30 days and act on an 
appeal within 30 days of the hearing; a briefing schedule would be established 
to ensure that the Board has materials in a timely manner; no requirement to 
have appealed at the Planning Commission prior to an appeal to the Board; the 
Board may affirm or reverse the determination with 6 votes; a tie vote is a 
disapproval.Public Notice:  Expands public notice of exemptions, 
requires exemption notice be in writing, posted on website and mailed to 
interested parties; Notice of Exemptions would also be posted on line and 
mailed; EIRs would have to be available at least 14 days before certification 
hearings at the Commission, and notice for area plans sponsored by the City 
would not require mailed notice.Preservation:  The Historic 
Preservation Commission is formally included in CEQA review; HPC is to provide 
comments at least 8 days prior to Planning Commission hearings; The ERO is 
required to consult with the HPC for projects that implicate historic 
resources.This proposed ordinance has been calendared for consideration 
again this coming Monday.
BOARD OF APPEALS REPORT:
·460 Townsend Streetis a Notice of Violation and Penalty (NOVP) that the Board unanimously upheld 
(4-0-1) on November 3, 2010.  The NOVP found that the Appellant, Academy of Art 
University (AAU), established an educational service at the subject property 
without benefit of building permit or conditional use authorization.  The Board 
voted 4-1 to deny the rehearing request.
·1321 De Haro Streetis a variance decision letter that the Board voted 2-2-1 to uphold on November 
3, 2010.  The variance decision allowed an encroachment into the required rear 
yard.  The Board voted unanimously to deny the rehearing request.
·Finally, the Board heard the appeal of variance decision which 
granted rear yard and front setback variances to the property at1266 Great 
Highway.  The Appellant argued that the proposed construction was out of 
character with the neighborhood.  The Permit Holder argued that the variance was 
justified due to the unique characteristics of the subject, which is shallow in 
depth (approximately 69 feet deep).  The Board voted 3-2 to grant the appeal and 
deny the variance.  Four votes are needed to overturn a departmental action; 
therefore, the variance was granted.
