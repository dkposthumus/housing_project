Future Meetings/Agendas.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Antonini:
-I would like to congratulate the Mayor and compliment the Board of Supervisors on their vote to approve the Candlestick project. Also in that vain I noticed some of you have seen on television this move by some billionaires to divest half of their income and I think that's a wonderful philanthropic thing and certainly there are many things as part of that plan that might involve significant amounts of private investments. Historically much in San Francisco much of what we have today have been the result of philanthropic individuals.
-The New Concourse, Golden Gate Park, even the original Kezar Stadium were all from individuals. So to that end it certainly would be something -- if someone's looking to put some money into something, I think this could become a reality.
-  Many parts of it, the park, the stadium the infrastructure, probably if we could involve some private individuals who feel so inclined but I think it's a good move to go forward with this plan.
Commissioner Borden:
-Today I had the pleasure to speak at the California Rail Speed Authority .They're meeting at 455 Golden Gate Avenue. I want to say how we support the high speed rail and how our planning practices of co-locating transit â helping with transit is critical in why high speed rail needed to have it in San Francisco. We were able to highlight some concerns that we've had about the separation of streets along 7th and 16th and commons that would break up Mission Bay from the rest of the city in the current plan.
-Also there was article in The Chronicle about temporary structures going on in Hayes Valley to take over the vacant land.
-I wondered if that would be something that become through the Planning Commission because it's just a temporary land use. It sounded really fascinating, a really great innovative idea but just how to better understand and how it's going to come together
-
Mark Luellen Senior Planner:
-No, this is going through section 312. So it's just a basic neighborhood notification. The project doesn't involve any entitlements that would become to you.
Commissioner Borden:
-The last thing is I have the opportunity to go to an event where actually President Miguel was also there, with the Transportation Commissioner from New York City, Janet Caunand, she was talking about all the cool park lets to make their streets more livable. What was so fascinating was that it didn't take a lot of money. It didn't take a lot of time. All they did basically was paint -- paint roadways. They changed -- they reclaimed Broadway and made that more of a street grid. They did some really phenomenal things all through the city. They're working on plans to rewrite the way the bike legislation is on the federal level.
-They're hoping they can adopt it so they could have the bike lanes near the curve .It made me think in a city like New York, if they could make these things happen, we should be able to as well. You could do a pilot with outgoing through a lot of process and give them people a case that would show them it could work. We could paint the street and check it out just like the Sunday streets and the success that took off there.
President Miguel:
- There was an excellent example, and I think the one thing in everyone's mind was how quickly they were able to get things accomplished there. It was absolutely amazing. Also had the pleasure along with Commissioner Borden and Commissioner Lee being at the mayor's signing of the Candlestick Hunter's point legislation.
- Actually signed in effect, as per on Tuesday Michael Yarne and Peter Albert  were there to present the section of the extension of the underground that is going eventually into Chinatown but basically the section that is South of Market Street and the two stops there and a really full discussion of the land use of south of market stops.We haven't heard so much and in that kind of detail as to the South of Market with a standing room only crowd, very, very involved, many of the old-timers but a very large number of younger people who are studying land use planning. It was a pleasure to see them there as well and the questions they asked. The department did a very, very good job on their presentation it was really excellent.
Director Rahaim:
-  I want to be picking up on Commissioner's Borden about New York Cityâs program.
-  We met with Janet.  She was in town a year ago. And that was our basis for pavement to park program that Andres Powell is in charge at this point we do have five of those now in place.
-  They've been a huge success in many ways, some more than others. And we are now working on very modest ones that are essentially taking a few parking spaces and commercial spaces for tables and chairs that the public can use and that was quite successful and quite attractive If you haven't seen the one on Divisadero Street, so Andres should be credited for that. Staff has been in charge of painting of pavements and planting of plants. It's been a wonderful staff and team building effort at the same time.

BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
LAND USE COMMITTEE:
§Castro Street NCD -CU for Restaurants and Self-Service;  would designate Specialty Food Establishments as âpermittedâ and would delete a provision that allows certain Fast Food establishments on one parcel.  Commissionerâs you heard this item on June 17thand unanimously recommended approval at that time.This week there was no public comment in opposition to the proposal and the Committee recommends approval to the Board.
§Parkmerced Project - 3711 - 19th AvenueSupervisor Elsbernd requested an informational hearing on the Park Merced Project. Parkmerced is an existing residential neighborhood with over 3,000 residential units on approximately 152 acres in 11 towers and 170 2-story buildings that lies adjacent to Lake Merced (Project Site). The proposed Project is a long-term mixed-use development program to comprehensively replan and redesign the site. The Project would increase residential density, provide a neighborhood core with new commercial and retail services, modify transit facilities, and improve utilities within the development site.About 1,700 of the existing apartments located in 11 tower buildings would be retained. Over a period of approximately 20 years, the remaining 1,500 existing apartments would be demolished in phases and fully replaced, and an additional 5,700 net new units would be added to the Project Site, resulting in a total of about 8,900 units on the Project Site. At this weekâs hearing Planning Director Rahaim introduced the project.  Michael Yarne from the Mayorâs Office gave an overview of MOU & DA process to date.  Peter Albert from the MTA discussed MTAâs role and the 19th Avenue Corridor Study.   Our staff manager, Sophie Hayward provided information on the development of the Design Guidelines, Public Realm, Urban Form and place-making components of the DA. The project sponsor and their architect discussed outreach, goals and more details about the project.At this time, we expect to hold the certification hearing on the EIR and bring the Development Agreement before you this fall.  As this hearing was only informational, the committee closed the hearing without action.
§Academy of Art:The Committee also held an informational hearing on the Academy of Art enforcement.  Planning Director Rahaim and our enforcement manager Chris Haw presented information about:
othe completion of inspection for all 37 properties of AAU by an interdepartmental task force.
oSuccessful removal of 35 signs
oAll outstanding CEQA and transportation information have been submitted.  This has enabled us to produce a project description and we expect to publish a notice of preparation by the end of Sept  & a scoping meeting is projected  for October.
oThe Department has issued enforcement notifications, NOVs and penalties for three of the four properties that were acquired post-EIR.

BOARD OF APPEALS
No Report
HISTORICAL PRESERVATION COMMISSION:
-  It was a pretty short calendar, but just briefly, they did have the amendment to various sections of the         planning code which would include articles 10 and 11.
-  It's on your calendar today. I want to say that the Commission did have a discussion for over an hour and they continued it for two weeks. But Ms. Sullivan will go into that with you.
- They did have some environmental impact reports before them. They felt that both of them (and one of them is 800 Presidio), were adequate per CEQA standards and didn't feel the need to write a letter to the E.R.O.
- The interesting thing about that one is that they felt that the -- they wanted some more information on the original architect for that building and they believe that the original architect might have been an African-American of little known -- and they wanted more information, but nothing that would trigger a need to write a letter.
-  They also had the DEIR for Yerba Buena Island. However, they did express a desire to save the âgun.âThey believe that the gun on Treasure Island -- well, they just believe the history for World War II and the significance of the island would be lost.  They felt there needs to be some sort of documentation to preserve that history.- There also was a concern that any new building not obscure Building One that's on the island

800 PRESIDIO AVENUE-Public Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Report -southeast corner of Presidio Avenue and Sutter Streets (Assessor's Block 1073, Lot 13) The project sponsors, Booker T. Washington Community Services Center in association with the San Francisco Mayor's Office of Housing, propose to demolish the existing 12,600-square-foot Booker T. Washington Community Center building, presumed an historic resource for purposes of environmental review and to construct a mixed-use structure, which would replace and enlarge the community/recreation center and include new residential units. The project would encompass approximately 70,000 square feet of space on six levels, five above grade and one below at a height of 55 feet along Presidio Avenue. The roughly 19,000 square-foot community center space would accommodate the centerâs current and future programs and would also include a gymnasium, meeting space, and several classrooms. The project would include 47 residential units in a mix of unit sizes, half of which would be designated below market rate (BMR) rental housing for emancipated foster youth and the other half BMR units available to both individuals and families. The project proposes 22 parking spaces in a basement garage accessible from a proposed curb cut on Sutter Street. The subject property is within an RM-1 Zoning District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District. The sponsor seeks to amend the Planning Code by establishing a "Presidio-Sutter Special Use District" (SUD) to modify building height and bulk, density, off-street parking, rear yard configuration, and open space requirements. The proposed SUD would necessitate text and map amendments (rezoning), which would require approval by the Board of Supervisors.
Preliminary Recommendation: No Action Required
Note: Written comments will be accepted at the Planning Departmentâs offices until the close of business on August 10, 2010.

Partial street vacations above and below street grade are proposed for areas of Beale, Fremont, First, Minna, Natoma, Howard, Tehama, Clementina, Oscar, Folsom, and Harrison Streets in order to accommodate the Transit Center building and its below-grade train box, as well as the bus ramps connecting the Transit Center to the Bay Bridge.

At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.

(1)  responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or
(2)  requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or
(3)directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.  (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))
