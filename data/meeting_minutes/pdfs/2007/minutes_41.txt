AnMarie Rodgers
Board of Supervisors:
1-Transit Development Impact Fee [TDIF] – Legislation sponsor by Supervisor McGoldrick to amend the Administrative Code limiting exceptions and clarifying the scope of it.Forwarded to the Board of Supervisors.
The Planning Department has been working with the Supervisor's Office, MTA and DBI on further revisions to ensure that collection and assessment of these fees require less staff time to review individual project/permit process.
2-Resolution to initiate the designation of First Saint John's Methodist Church at 1601 Larkin Street as a landmark – Article 10 of Planning Code.Adopted.
The Planning Department will prepare a report of the Landmark Board's support for Commission consideration.
-I just want to remind you that there is a possible pending extension to the Medical Cannabis Dispensary [MCD] regulations.
-Currently the Board of Supervisors is considering extending the deadlines for completing the registration process to January 1, 2008.
-This proposed extension would not apply to MCD operators who have not yet begun the application process by July 1, 2007.
-Please be aware that this change has not yet been approved.
-This item has been calendar for the City Operations and Neighborhood Services Committee for -Thursday, June 14, 2007.
-The Department supports this extension and it is working actively with the MCD operators to get them through the review process.
Zoning Administrator Badiner
Board of Appeals:
7.943 Church Street- Project Status(Tape IA; IB)
SPEAKERS
Alex Bash
-I am a neighbor and a retired professional planner.
-My major focus while working at the Planning Department was to administer a fair and open planning/permitting process.
-Unfortunately, we have a very unfair situation because the developer's plans changed after your review last year.
-It was even changed after the Board of Appeal's review from last year.
-These changes are very significant to the neighbors.
-I submitted a petition signed by over 60 neighbors with concerns of height and massiveness.
-The hearings were controversial at this Commission and the Board of Appeals with many hours of testimony
-The neighbors had lost and we were ready to put everything behind us.
-Now that the project is being built, we find out that they are adding a roof deck.
-The roof over hangs on the adjacent properties.
-Two important technical details.First of all, staff did not even review the plans adding the roof deck so it would not be hard to call it back and review it.
-Secondly, the floor over hanging at the rear of the property, [not in the plan you heard in 2006] does not meet the code.
Rita
-I live directly adjacent to the new development.
-Our building is mostly affected because of its height.It has taken away the natural light.
-The developer told the Commission that the set back would be to the side [to the north].
-Changes were made to the plan after the hearing causing more shadows and darkness to us.
-The big roof over hanging on the back was not presented at the hearing either.
-Do not let this happen and go back to the original plans.
Dan
-I would like to talk about the 3-foot roof.
-There have been changes to the plan.
-In the original plan, there was no access to the roof from the front of the property.
-They built stairs covered with plywood.
-A few days after taking photos to bring it to the Commission, there were more changes done.
-[Shared photos showing different changes made to the construction and the original plans proposed for this project.]
Anne Walker
-Expressed appreciation to the Commission for allowing this time to discuss this matter.
-The neighborhood knew that the developer wanted to add a roof deck.
-The first sketch shown to the neighbors had a roof deck.The second sketch had stairs and a penthouse deck.
-The developer's brief for the discretionary review hearing said that they would have a proposed roof in keeping with the street landscape and roofline pattern.
-A few months later, the developers resurrected the roof deck.
-The deck was not even drawn on the roof plan.It was on the mechanical plan's final page.
-This is a bate and switch by the developer claiming credit for a flat roof.
William Duke
-I live across the street from this project.
-It is so disappointing to see what has happened at this property.
-It is totally illegal.This is not a game.
-These are big time developers.They have developed over 70 projects in the bay area.They know what they are doing.
-They deceived this Commission, neighbors and the Department.
-Over 100 neighbors are opposed to this project.
-There has got to be a way to take care of this.
-Something similar happened in this neighborhood at another property about 20 years ago and the Department said to turn it down and they did.
-We request that you do the same thing.
Sue Hestor
-I just want to clarify that the addition to the building was a little addition and became this much bigger.
-If this Commission allows this to happen, how do we deal with discretionary reviews?
-The Planning Department says that in order to be in conformity with 311, they had to take off the deck and stairway to the roof.
-If a project has been changed with the direction from staff before the 311-notice was issued, staff cannot put changes back after the fact.
-That is not consistent with good practice.
-This is a prescription for multiple hassles.This one is particular outrageous.
Todd Mavis, Owner of the Property
-As usual, there are two sides to every story.
-The reason why we are here is because of neighbor's private views.
-Our neighbors have been upset during all this process and much more because they did not succeed.
-Regarding all these allegations about illegal activities and deceptions are not truth.
-We reviewed plans extensively with staff.
-Our neighbors have filed 7 complaints with the building department [DBI].
-DBI has come out each time on every complaint and found no violation or merit to the allegation / complaint made.
-Neighbors have called various agencies [State and Federal] and even called Immigration to check if the people that work for us are illegal.
-They have tried everything they could to try to slow us in this project.
-The Board of Appeals was fair and requested this Commission to look into this.
-Tina, staff from your Department, reviewed the allegations, discussed with people and went back to the Board of Appeals to report that none of the allegations were correct.
-Requested that the Commission not start protecting public views.
Kevin Cheng, Project Sponsor and Property Owner
-We have detailed analysis here that indicates that the entire process was proper throughout.
-The plan clearly indicates what our intent is.
-The neighbors just want to eliminate the fourth floor.
-The key indication is that they failed to ask at any time during the entire process anything else but the removal of the fourth floor.
-The only concern is their private view.
-I have photos showing what the plan has been as indicated throughout the entire process.
Sherrie Bash
-All we are asking is that the building be built as approved.
-We did not say anything before because we assumed that the construction was going to be the way it was approved.
-We did speak many times with the project sponsor.
-There is a real problem with things slipping through the cracks and I am sure you will look into putting them in the right place.
-The attitude you see on the developer today is consistent with someone who feels entitled and willing to say whatever they need to meet the need of the moment.
-Probably, the adjacent neighbors main concern is their private view.What about the almost one hundred people in the area that signed the petition opposing?
-Requested help to deal with this project.
ACTION:No Action required of the Commission.Project Status Only.
D.GENERALPUBLIC COMMENT – 15 MINUTES(Tape IB)

SPEAKERS
-On behalf of our community, I want to thank you for approving the commencement of the Japan Town Neighborhood Plan.
-Our plan started with a public meeting in March attended by over two hundred people.
-There is a lot of excitement that the neighborhood has for a real chance for community planning for its future.
-We would be working with Mr. Ken Rich and Rosie Dodley.
-We are concerned with seeing the impact of several proposed developments in the area.
-Specially the very significant high-rise market-rate condominium development [1333 Gough Street].
-We are excited about the opportunity for the revitalization of our neighborhood and we want to see it done in a responsible planning process.

3424 JACKSON STREET- north side between Laurel and Locust Streets: Lot 003B in Assessor's Block 0971 -Requests for Discretionary Reviewof Building Permit Application No. 2005.08.29.1450 proposing to add a three-story horizontal addition (with roof deck) to the rear of the existing ground floor, first and second floors; a deck that will extend beyond the second-floor rear addition; a horizontal addition to the rear of the third floor; and a one story horizontal addition at the front of the existing fourth floorof the single-family home located in an RH-1 (Residential, House, One-Family) District and 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project as revised.
SPEAKERS
Howard Alman, Attorney for the first Discretionary Review Requestor
-Objected to the proceedings and the use of Categorical Exception.
-This is a house that is admittedly historic.
-Instead of the categorical exception, this should have gone through the Environmental Impact Review process, which would have required public input.
-This process has been possibly modified to deal with the historic aspect of it.
-It has been predicated purely on an erroneous criteria based on the idea that design is what counts.
-One criterion that should have been applied is the significance of this house that has been very important for the people in San Francisco.
Edward Karkar, First Discretionary Review Requestor
-My wife and I live at 3430 Jackson Street, west of the proposed subject project.
-I want to wish Mr. Marwell and his family well and be good neighbors.
-The main issue is the loss of privacy and natural light.
-Accurately, this drawing shows the site lines from the elevated decks intruding into our bedroom and breakfast area, affecting significantly our quality of life.
-The expansion proposed creates series of decks, a high wall three feet away from our home blocking sunlight and intruding on our privacy.
-It is a very aggressive and intrusive project.
Carl Smith, Second Discretionary Review Requestor's Representative
-Ms. Peabody lives to the east of the subject property.
-The concern is the large scale of the decks in the blocking of her sunlight and garden.
-The owner of the property is planning to set back the storage area on the ground floor.
-The only reason that is being planned that way is because of the concern of the impact to the foundation of the property.
-If this is approved, I recommend that the owner bound [bond] my client's house on a couple of issues: foundation, painting and kitchen exhaust from the subject property to go up to the roof.
-Reduce the size of the master bedroom to set back the deck and the master bathroom would be in line with the edge of my client's house.
Jorge de Quezada, Architect
-I have worked with Mr. Karkar to give suggestions on this project.
-The way that this project is presented, it would dominate the entire block and a lot of people are opposed to it.
-My suggestion is to adopt the same guidelines that you apply for zoning in RH2 [Residential House – two family] districts.
-It is very appropriate when you have a project between two buildings with different property lines.
-One condition that we are suggesting is to have a deck on the first floor and eliminate any others above that.
-Hanging decks are not safe and require massive construction in order to be seismic resistance.The material proposed for the extension of the decks is four by four wood.
Alice Barkley, Project Sponsor Representative
-[Showed pictures to put into perspective the location and relationship between the discretionary review requestors' home and the project being proposed today.]
-The height would be in line with other properties including the requestor's.
-In terms of light, air and shadows, I have included in the packet a shadow diagram clearly showing that this project would not have impact on Ms. Peabody's property.
-Mr. Karkar's home would have some extra shadow in June.It would not be significant.
-Regarding privacy concerns - this photograph shows that view to Mr. Karkar's bedroom already exists.
-Many people would not stand on a deck to view someone's bedroom.
-Staff has very carefully evaluated the addition against the Secretary of Interior Guidelines.
-If there is no impact on an existing historic structure, you do not need to go forward with Environmental Impact Report (EIR).
-Regarding the concern from Ms. Peabody about the foundation of her property - the contractor that's hired would ensure that any potential damage would be taken care of.
-As far as the master bedroom - there would be a narrow three-foot deck to provide access to the emergency stairwell.
-The deck is being supported by steel columns and pins to ensure safety for my client's children.
Tracy Leeds, Owner
-I am here to identify the use of the space and why we designed it the way we have.
-We have three children [8, 6 and 2 years old] that attend three different schools in the area.
-Our parents come to visit us periodically and stay with us for a little bit.
-We found this house close to my children's schools and in need of some repairs to accommodate our family.
-The deck is meant to provide play space outside and allow me to be able to supervise them from the kitchen.
-We moved from New York and are in love with San Francisco.We would like to stay in the city and accommodate our family.
Evan Marwell, Owner
-This has been a long and frustrating process.
-Throughout this process, we have abided by the guidelines the Department has given us.
-We have tried to manage reasonable concerns from our neighbors.
-We spent four months in mediation with Mr. Karkar's concerns.
-After one year and six different designs trying to mediate concerns of Mr. Karkar, we did not succeed.
-Last November we decided to go for this project with the latest design presented today.
Shawn Fred, Architect
-Our landscape architect has specified that the trees to be planted could go up to 50 feet tall.
-We would trim them below the third story window on the side of the second floor.
ACTION:Took Discretionary Review and Approved as amended:
-Additional 4-foot set back from side of the property on the 2ndfloor deck.
-Additional 4-foot set back on the 3rdfloor deck to the brick and glass slide door.
-To remove the railing of the third floor rear extension deck and keep it only as a roof.

-Openings typically convey a sense of depth of material at building walls.
-Windows are often distinguished through ornamentations.
-In an effort to provide a continuous building wall along both streets, we have configured the building in an  L  layout.
-A bulb tower-like corner element kept by a floating canopy structure emphasizes the project's urban design status, as a corner building.

SPEAKERS
Harry O'Brian, Project Sponsor Representative
-The sponsor is already legally permitted to rent non-office space to tenants that anywhere else in the city would be consider office usage.
-Section 321 approval is a technicality that would cause no physical change to the existing building or to the tenants that occupy it.
-Then it came back for its second time and was approved to be occupied with 270,000 square feet of office space and 375,000 square feet for multimedia/business services.
-For every proposed tenant for this building, the sponsor comes to the Zoning Administrator for a determination applying the rules that were in effect in 1999.
-The determinations issued classifies a particular tenant as an office or business service use.
-We have been working with Supervisor Maxwell's Office and have reached an agreement with community groups represented here today.
Tony Kelly, President of the Potrero Booster Neighborhood Association
-Urged the Department to use its future energy to complete the Eastern Neighborhoods rezoning plan.
Joe Boss
-Clarifying the use of the building helps reduce the amount off-street parking, and fees would help housing and transportation, which is very much needed in the city.

Barbara Gualco, Director of Housing Development for Mercy Housing - Project Sponsor
-Mercy Housing has deep roots in the city having developed 28 affordable housing projects over the last 30 years.
-We have been working for many years with our development partner - South of Market Health Center represented by Charles Range.
-The result of our joint efforts is a very innovated mixed-use housing development addressing two big needs in San Francisco [affordable housing and health care].
-We are hopeful that you will certify the Environmental Review Report and approve the remaining entitlements.
Charles Range, Director of South of Market Health Center
-I am deeply happy and proud to be involved in this project with Mercy Housing to achieve two objectives in the South of Market.
-The two objectives we are trying to achieve with this project are within the South of Market Plan for the community.
-Medical facilities and affordable housing are needed in the city and this project would meet those goals.
-The health center would have better access for the public and enhance service to this community.

601 DUBOCE AVENUE-Lot 3539, Lot 001 -Appeal of a Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declarationfor the proposed construction of a four-story medical office building ( MOB ) on a 52,000 square foot portion of two surface parking lots on the northeast corner of the California Pacific Medical Center Davies campus in the Duboce Triangle neighborhood. The 50,100 (46,000 as measured by the Planning Code) gross-square-foot MOB would contain offices, a Neuromuscular and Electroencephalogram Clinic, a pharmacy and admitting station for the existing ambulatory surgery department in the CPMC Hospital North Tower. Patient drop-off would be located adjacent the MOB's third floor, accessible via the existing Duboce Avenue service drive. The MOB would include two pedestrian entries: a southern entrance along Noe Street and a northern entrance located along Duboce Avenue across from the N-Judah MUNI stop. The project would result in removal of 75 onsite surface parking spaces; no new off-street parking spaces would be constructed as part of the project. Pedestrian and streetscape improvements, including a public plaza, landscaping and sidewalk widening along Noe Street would be undertaken as part of the project. The project site is in the RH-3 (Residential House, Three Family) Zoning District and the 65-D Height and Bulk District, and would require Conditional Use authorization for expansion of an institutional use in an RH-3 Zoning District, an amendment CPMC's Planned Unit Development, permits from the Department of Public Works for tree removal and new landscaping, as well as building permits from the Department of Building Inspection.
Preliminary Recommendation: Uphold Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration
(Continued from Regular Meeting of April 12, 2007)
SPEAKERS
Sue Hestor, Representative of the Appellant - Noe Neighbors Representative
-This site was called Franklin/Ralph K. Davis Hospital before becoming the California Pacific Medical Center [CPMC].
-The entire facility needs to be analyzed because it is structured to shift certain uses/function to certain campuses.
-The Master Plan for all the facilities is pending a hearing and this project is going through while an Environmental Impact Review is in progress.
-It is an addition of neuroscience tied to California Pacific that is not a free standing medical office building created with the Franklin/Ralph K. Davis.
-The saga of the planning consideration of Franklin/Ralph K. Davis had a lot to do with how that facility fits in a residential neighborhood.
-In the past, the Planning Commission carefully buffered the campus in particular because of the height of the site.
-It is indicated on page 36 of the document.It says that the orientation is the most brutally architecture.
-If you bring the development down on Noe Street and have a commercial wall, it is something that is part of an environmental analysis.
-That part is absolutely insufficient in the environmental document.It is one of the reasons why an environmental impact report is necessary.
-Here we are with no analysis and no mentioning of the historical survey that is going to be incorporated to the east and south of this site.
Theodore Franklin, United Healthcare Workers Union
-We have three concerns we would like to address: parking, air pollution and the failure of due process.
-Regarding parking and traffic - we submitted a carefully considered critique of the city's analysis of parking and traffic to be generated by this project.
-The city has responded to this report highlighting five key flaws in the traffic and parking analysis.
-The analysis ignores the fact that Duboce Avenue already has impairment traffic conditions.
-The city analysis is saying that measures would take place set for by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District.
Tay Via, California Pacific Medical Center Representative
-I sent a letter to the Commission highlighting legal standards that I am sure you are aware of it.
-In terms of Market-Octavia, this project is not in that area and the institutional setting would not impact the eligibility of the district if in the future it is determined to be historic.
Jonathan Youtt
-We spent the past five days informing the community of this project and we have over 450 signatures requesting the review.
-We realize that California Environmental Quality Act requires full Environmental Impact Review for any public space that would have a shadow cast by any new development.
Steve Vitka, Noe Duboce Neighbors
-In the original Environmental Review, there was a proposal for an underground garage and I wonder why it is not included at this time.
Robert Bush
-Urged the Commission to approve the Planning Department's ruling of concentration in the project itself.
-This project provides an answer to the concerns of patients, physicians and the neighborhood.
-There are adverse problems as it is with any construction like parking, traffic and the impact to residents on Noe Street.
Peter Cohen
-The idea of high quality medical service is not exclusive to good development on the ground that mitigates and to be sensitive to the neighbors.
-Two of the issues that are of concern to the neighbors are the scale of the building and the attempted impact from that building as well as the traffic.
-The preliminary survey results shows that most of the Duboce Triangle area probably is going to be eligible as a historic district.
-This is a matter of how the scale impacts would be analyzed given the historic significance of the neighborhood.
-The other issue is traffic.It is about analyzing the situation carefully to understand what it means in real terms and try to mitigate for those things.
-We would like the negative declaration to be used to inform you on specific issues that could be handled quickly.
ACTION:Negative Declaration upheld.

SPEAKERS
Martin Brotman, President & CEO, Pacific Medical Center - Project Sponsor
-The proposed project is the most important to Davis Campus, neighbors and to the city of San Francisco.
-Bringing the neuroscience to this campus fits the programs and services already provided at this campus.
-We already completed our seismic retrofit at the campus and are upgrading our emergency department.
-We are building a unique theme park to ensure that our disabled persons have the best rehabilitation care.
-We are also continuing our acute medical surgical and microsurgery services at Davis Campus, already existing and to continue in the new facilities.
-This project would greatly help us hold and attract highly specialized positions in neuroscience.
-It would bring together under one roof two very important linked programs -- neuroscience and rehabilitation.
-We have worked for several years with the neighborhood task force to ensure that the community's needs are fully understood.
-Our current design creates a very attractive transition between the existing hospital and the community.
-San Francisco is a leader of health care and Pacific Medical provides one third of the health care in the city.
-This project is a result of a collaborative work between the Medical Center, the Planning Department and the Neighborhood Task Force.
Ralph Marqueza
-Our role was to assist in the development process and to coordinate the objectives of all the diverse community interests.
-Many of this project's features are the result of the partnership with those district's community interests that started five years ago.
-A Neighborhood Task Force was created and met regularly for that period.
-Besides meeting with the task force, we also made regular presentations at large neighborhood meetings and included information in its newsletters.
-We have identified hundreds of supporters of this project including neighbors, family members, patients and medical staff.
-I would like to submit this binder containing the substantial support that we have documented so far.
-We are extremely proud of the quality of the project we were able to produce with the community help.
Neal Morrison, Noe Neighbors
Jonathan Youtt, Noe Neighbors
-The neighborhood is mostly residential except this particular block with the project in question.
-We spoke with over 450 people and the main concern is the green belt running along Duboce to Noe Street.
-The original construction of the Davis Medical Center, back in the late 60's, there was a condition thatconstruction of four stalls into the interior of the building allowing the green belt to act as a buffer.
-We feel that it is an important aspect for allowing such a huge commercial venture within the residential confines.
-We support the project but we need to mitigate some of those issues and have them built into the conditions of approval.
-Our proposal is to make an impenetrable edge between housing and the hospital.They could use the other seven entrances of the hospital.
-The document keeps saying that there are three and four story buildings on Noe Street.There is only one four-story property and there are two three-story properties.
-We are looking for ways to reduce the impact on the neighborhood.
-We have a list with proposed mitigations and we would like a dialogue with the hospital in order to get these taken care of.
-The signatures on the petition are people that live in the neighborhood and would like ways to mitigate our issues.
Mary Lanier, California Pacific Medical Center
-Thanked neighborhood task force and neighbors for all the work and hours invested in this project.
-We have really worked very diligently to have a good relationship with the neighborhood groups.
-We have been responsive on various issues not necessarily related to this building but just for living in the neighborhood together.
-We are sharing our resources with our community like providing parking on weekends for special activities.
-We have been here for over 150 years.We were here during the quake and we intend to provide excellent health care for years to come.
-Our nursing unit and emergency department regularly scores in the top percentile across the country for patient satisfaction.
Leo Chow, Project's Architect
-Looking at the community and the neighborhood, we tried to respond to important characteristics of the site.
-One is the green corridor on Noe Street that connects it from Market Street to Duboce Park.
-Residences across the street are recognized for their variety, changes in scale and the fact that they are primarily built of wood.
-Early on, the thought was to create a building that would act as a bridge between two different contexts -- between the residences and the hospital.
-The existing access to the facility has seven vehicle entrances helping Noe Street traffic.
Geoffrey Nelson
-When you look at the conditions of approval, there are none that do not have the fingerprints of the members of the Duboce Triangle and the task force.
-We have made as large an effort as possible to try to get the word out.This diagram shows the mailings, walking in the neighborhoods, etc.
Robert Miller
-We are honored to be the program chosen to make the move and really invest in neuroscience to help people with neurological diseases.
Steve Vitka, Noe Duboce Neighbors
-What we are proposing is some sort of mediated process at this point.We urge you not to approve today and give us time to negotiate the list of issues.
-We have no commitment here.We would like a better arbitration process and negotiate that as well.
Robert Miller
Dennis Richards, President of the Duboce Triangle Neighborhood Association
-This is the largest development that the interior block is going to experience since the hospital itself.
-The task force has narrowed down the issues to three: architectural, traffic and pedestrian affects, size and mass and fourth floor concerns about the roof to reduce shadow impacts on Noe Street.
-We absolutely support where the Medical Center is going.Unfortunately, we were short on one area and that was the roof.
Richard Magary, Buena Vista Neighborhood Association
-The task force included very well publicized and open community meetings with periodic reports to the neighborhood.
Joseph Sophie
-I feel that this project is very important for the community for treatment and follow up services at the same facility.
Dee Holden Norris
-We have taken it into consideration and the architect has designed an internal driveway to allow drop-off patients at our doors.
Cathy Kennedy
Jeffrey Phillips, Local 6
-He was taken to the General Hospital and doctors said it could be reattached at Davis Medical Center and he was transferred.
-The thumb was reattached and he recovered 80 percent of the original strength in a few months.
-Davis Center has been that kind of resource for us in the building trades and for the city generally.
Walter Menzel, Patient
Michael Steadman
Wendy Baker
-The hospital currently hides behind tall trees and acts as a major landscape buffer against Noe Street's light and glare.
Leslie Uptain, Director of The Muscular Dystrophy Association
-It is a leader in the world of neuroscience.This particular clinic is known as one of the top three across the nation and most certainly the best.
-It is very important to have a place that patients would feel comfortable in - a peaceful place where they can get hope.
Wendy Coffee
-I would like to say that I am not against the construction or the service that would be provided to citizens.
-I am concerned about the impact of this project on our historic and residential neighborhood.
-To help mitigate the impacts of the increased traffic, The Medical Center should keep entrances to its Davis Campus on 14thStreet and Duboce Avenue.
-There should be no curbside drop off on Noe Street.Instead, they should create a continuously landscaped edge to separate it from the sidewalk.
Jackie Phan, Clinical Specialty for Stroke
-I have had the opportunity to work with physician, nurses and other staff to develop, maintain and improve several neuroscience programs.
-Emergent and aggressive treatment of patients in acute stroke can reduce disability and improve patient recovery if implemented in an extremely quick time frame.
Ann Bedenk, Stroke Coordinator for California Pacific Medical Center
-We are extraordinarily lucky to have our stroke neurologist and neurosurgeons on 24 hours - 7days basis.
-[Shared experience of husband that suffered a stroke and was attended at Pacific Medical Center.]
Gerry Crowley, Neighborhood Network
-There are two things missing here: No Institutional Master Plan and Institutional Design Guidelines.
Rebecca Symmons, Manager for the Davis Campus - Emergency Department
-This Emergency Department has been consistently in the top ten percentile for patient's satisfaction of care.
-The neuroscience center would help support the emergency department to continue to provide excellent care.
Paul Wermer
-The Pacific Medical Center has a great deal of respect from neighbors.The Medical Center knows how to address the facility's issues but not the neighborhood impacts.
-Urged as a condition of use for this facility two things: a prohibition of passenger/loading zone along Noe Street and requirement for the Medical Center to take steps to inhabit patients on Noe Street.
Carol Brownson
Jim Meko, Neighborhood Network
-The requests are so simple: widen sidewalks, safer crosswalks, better landscaping, mitigating shadow impacts and traffic.
Jim Salinas Sr., Carpenters Local Union 22
-I am very confident that the representatives from California Pacific Medical Center have made a great effort to work with the community and neighbors.
Karen Apena
Gregg Wilcox
-We spent a lot of time with Pacific Medical Center and they compromised with the task force.
-On the architecture, they agreed that this building fit very well in the neighborhood character.
-On the issue of the drop off spot - this was a compromise we made because we do not want double parking on the streets.
Linda de Mello
-I appreciate the needs of residents in the accommodation for people living near a medical facility.
-First one is personal. Many people in this room are at risk of heart attacks and strokes.It is a privilege to have access to quality care.
-There is an extraordinary need to be able to leverage the international research capacities of neuroscience specialists.
-It is critical that the Davis project allow our specialists to collaborate and leverage their expertise for all people.
Paula Lykins, Manager of Community Relations of California Pacific Medical Center
-In my role, I interface with the public on a wide range of topics from sponsorship, tours of the hospital and any impact that might confront the community.
-I communicate often with our neighbors via email or direct mail to their homes about impacts that might arise relating to the remodel of the Davis Campus.
Peter Weber
-I did surgery on a patient with epilepsy.I cannot do this alone.It is a team approach by bringing all people together in a neuroscience center like this.
Greg Monardo, Former President/CEO of Medical Center
-The drop off point on Noe Street used to be the main entrance to the facilities prior to the construction in 1965
Ken Howard, Project Manager for Davis Campus
Peter Cohen, Duboce Triangle Association
-You can see that the Duboce Triangle is essentially a Victorian small-scale neighborhood.
-The California Pacific Medical Campus is a giant square in the middle.The small square is the Medical Office building.
-It might seem small in the context of San Francisco but is big in terms of the neighborhood.
-All of the issues raised are very minor and they have to do with the fact that this building comes off from the campus.
Sue Hestor, Attorney for Noe Neighbors
-The staff report does not really give you guidance on the issues that the neighbors are here talking about.
-The noise, glare and scale were a very important part of the analysis from prior Planning Commissions.
-They do not discuss the historic survey under way right now.That is a major omission because it does not matter that this project is outside the boundaries.
-What the neighbors are asking is for traffic calming and adding a street wall down to Noe Street with no buffering.
-If you are not ready to impose these mitigations today, continue it and make the staff be the mediator.
Tay Via
-There is no consensus in the neighborhood and that has put CPMC [California Pacific Medical Center] in a difficult position.
-Buena Vista and Duboce Triangle had one outstanding issue and now they are bringing a list of 13 issues.
-The difficulty is that in some cases they are mutually exclusive.
-Some of the things proposed as simple solutions, actually undue understandings that have been negotiated over the years.
-The traffic drop off is the perfect example.Many people agreed to it and others in the near vicinity have disagreed.
-At this point, CPMC is really asking you to rule on the project and to rely in large part on livable street which would address almost everyone's issues raised tonight.

SPEAKERS
Gerry Crowley
-I have many fun memories of going to Grandparent's Day at the French American School.Both of my granddaughters attended there.
-I really support this landmark designation and hope you will too.
Alan Martinez, Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board
Jim Chappell, SPUR
-I have taught history and theory of urban design in those very buildings for about 20 years.
-During that time, neighbors frequently complaint about this institutional use in a residential neighborhood.
Roberta Achtenberg
Rob Bregoff, Lower Haight Organization
-Overwhelmingly, the neighbors support the reuse of the building.The main concern in the Lower Haight is crime and safety.
-We support the preservation of the building.But landmark at this time would tie the hands of any project sponsor.
-We would like to see the Haight Street side with windows and with good urban planning.
-The site has the potential to be a very good addition and centerpiece in the Lower Haight.
Marilyn Isabell
-I am here as a potential consumer/resident of this site.
-Some of the proposed housing there would be for seniors, gay, lesbian, transgender and bisexual.
Frederick Knaff
-The article 10 is appropriate for a completed site that you want to see remain in its current form.
-Making something landmark two years after presented to the Board is not appropriate.It is too late to start that process.
Marcy Adelman, Open House
John Phillips
-It is time to make good use of the six-acre parcel by developing housing that is sorely needed for our community.
Leslie Miessner
-Also, I am speaking on behalf of Elaine Adamson.[Read and submitted her letter opposing to the landmark designation.]
Robie Robinson
Joan Hull
Elaine
-I am going to read a letter from Lisa because she needed to leave.
Ruth Herring
-The center would be for the positive side of life and would reach out to so many people in the city.
-The landmarking of the site would take us to a continuous dead end.
Moli Steinhert, Executive Director of Open House
-We are working to ensure that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and seniors have access to safe housing and ageing support services in San Francisco.
-We feel we can make a vital contribution to the community if we are allowed to build at this site.
Hadley Hall
Matt Fance
-This development would be rental.Sixty five percent of people that live in San Francisco are renters.
Elisabeth Gunther, University of California – Project Sponsor
-First, you have been told that we only own two blocks of the site.A substantial portion is used for the University's Dental Clinic.
-The dental clinic is an existing public use and the University intents to continue that use.
-With respect to our lack of support for the designation - we do not think the site as a whole has historic associational value.
-We do acknowledge that there are historic resources on site and fully support the attempt to preserve those resources.
-We do not think that its current condition, broken up as it is by the parking lot and the dental clinic, is historic.
Ruthy Bennett, AF Evans
-One of our goals for this site was to preserve and reuse the existing building as much as we can.
-We worked with the community and Heritage to find a solution that would be viable financially, economically and in terms of preservation.
-[Submitted a letter from Heritage endorsing the project.]We worked long and hard in terms of which building to save and what parts of the building to save.
-Our goal with this project is to take this building and help them be an important and effective part of the community.
Neil Sims, Open House
-The public park to be built and managed in perpetuity by the developer on behalf of the city with open access to the public is very phenomenal.
Lavon Tabback, Save the UC Laguna Street Campus Group
-The majority of people that I spoke to are very much in favor of the city preserving this vital historic resource.
-A lot of us live in San Francisco for very good reasons and among them is the rich architectural and artistic heritage that the city provides us.
-One of the reasons that I got involved in the project was because of the beautiful mural in Richardson Hall that takes almost the entire wall.
Elyze Stewart
-I am in support of the landmark designation.The buildings are so special because they provide historic value to the city.
-Also, there is going to be a lot of developments in our neighborhood along Market Street.
Vincent March, Member of Friends of 1800
-I urge the Commission to consider the merits of the nomination as a landmark within the boundaries contained on the site.
-Consider the adapted reuse of and rehabilitation and new construction at a further point in time until the certificate of appropriateness is processed.
Paul Olsen, President of Hayes Valley Neighborhood Association
-HVNA [Hayes Valley Neighborhood Association] is on record of supporting the list of the buildings on the National Registrar of Historic Places and for its preservation.
-HVNA is also on record as supporting adaptive reuse of the campus and thus would be opposed to any measure that affectively precludes that.
Cynthia Servetnick, Save the UC Laguna Street Campus Group
-Later this summer you would have an opportunity to vote whether to approve the AF Evans Open House project or not.
-At that time, if landmarked, you could approve it taking overriding considerations under the California Environmental Quality Act [CEQA] and by approving a certificate of appropriateness in accordance with Article 10.
-Tonight, we are here to discuss whether this campus merits landmarking.It is at risk.
-The Planning Department, The Landmark Preservation Advisory Board and The State Historic Preservation Officer have agreed that it is eligible for the California register.
-I urge you to support your own Landmark Preservation Advisory Board that has advised you to landmark the campus.
Anson Snyder
-I have no conflict of interest with this project on a private or any public side.I am speaking as a resident.
-Support the landmark and you could still put it for other uses and open it up for community use.
David Dupree, Chairman of The Corless Foundation
-I urge you to not approve this site for landmark status but to approve the four buildings sitting on the property.
-The developer is very confident and able to move rapidly.They should be allowed to do so with modifications.
Mark Paez, Chair of Friends 1800
-Charles Chase from San Francisco Heritage has worked very closely with my organization on the National register nominations as well as the landmark nominations.
-The landmark is fairly new in the course of events but the recognition of resources has always been stated up front.
-We spent about $14,000 so far with much of the money donated.This is a really truly community based effort.
-When we met with project sponsor, we tried to encourage them to use the Federal Rehabilitation Credit.
Steven
Fred
-We will not have an opportunity to introduce housing into the old buildings and do it adequately in a way that reflects the current use.
-We will not be able to introduce the public parks, community garden and the mix of rental housing.
-Fully, eighty three percent of the existing square footage on the site would be preserved.
Judy, Member of Friends 1800
-Support the landmark designation.
-I worked at that building for many years and I am familiar with the beauty of the buildings.
-Also, the landmark historic resource done and the nomination do not include the dental clinic and the parking lot.
-Landmarking the site does not preclude any project to be built there.It would only require oversight.
Steve Vettel
-The project requires a conditional use, rezoning, overriding findings under the Environmental Impact Report and imposes mitigation measures.
-Unfortunately, article 10 of the Planning Code is not designed to accommodate over adaptive reuse.
-It is designed to honor existing buildings that want to remain in their current use and stage.
-Adaptive reuse is the way to go with this property and you have plenty of opportunities to oversee how the use is done and being sensitive to the historic nature of this building.
ACTION:Disapproved landmark designation.

SPEAKERS
Tony Pantaleoni, Project Sponsor
-The first floor consists of two off street parking spaces and a small studio in-law unit for the father of the project sponsor.
-The second floor is the traditional living/dining/kitchen room layout with a family living room.
-The third floor is for the bedrooms and a study room.
-The side section of the property is up sloping and we would be excavating into the existing hill for the project.
-We also provide a recessed entry at the street level for automobile and pedestrians as well as a third-floor recessed archway balcony.
-The exterior material would be cement, plaster, painted wood trim, and iron artwork.For potted plants there would be terracotta tile and a recessed aluminum for windows.
-The project keeps the neighborhood character and we feel we would be using proper materials.
Keltin Finley, Sound Engineer
-We have evaluated the soundness of this building based on the Planning Department's policy and we found it to be unsound.
-Specifically, we applied the policy as it applies to structure upgrades that address structure hazard.
-Our goal was not to bring the building into compliance with the current code but rather to address what we consider to be structural hazard.
-We feel that any member that is unable to support the anticipated loads that it is to carry would unquestionably be a structural hazard.
Mike, The Owner
-I designed the house for my father to live in the lower part of the house with an elevator to have access to the top floors.
-Before I bought this building, it had not been lived in for fifteen years.It has been vacant for about twenty years at this point.
