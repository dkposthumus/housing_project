B.COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
Commissioner Sugaya:
-I asked staff to provide more detail on the solar panel.
-They checked with the City Attorney and unless they are tide to a larger project, panels are going to start showing up.
-As a reminder to staff, I'd still like to get a quick status report on the Preservation Element.
Commissioner Moore
-On December 7, we met with the Building Inspection Commission and agreed to work in closer collaboration.
-I attended an annual Pacific Earthquake/Engineer Research Institute [PER] meeting on January 19.It focused on tall building design.
-Tall buildings create a demand for performance.These approaches would enable construction using a new framing system that would allow additional height
-PER is responding to this need by leading an initiative to develop design criteria for tall buildings -- ensuring they are safe in earthquakes.
-We need to work in closer coordination and collaboration with city departments of all levels.
-I ask you to consider a meeting with DBI in less than two months. We are dealing with high building applications.
-There is a possibility of a DBI sub-committee and I would like be part of it.
-Received an invitation from the Mayor's Office for a reception next Wednesday.
Commissioner Olague
-There was a recent sell of the Armory to a pornographic company.
-This store would be within two blocks of an elementary school and I'd like to know if anybody knows about them.
Mr. Badiner, Zoning Administrator
-I would like a copy of the presentation of Pacific Earthquake/Engineer Research Institute [PER].And it is a good idea to schedule a joint meeting with the DBI Commission.
-Commissioner Sugaya now has the report on the Preservation Element.
-I just received an e-mail to tell us that the owner of the pornographic store in the armory scheduled a meeting for next week at the Planning Department.We do not know yet what permit they are seeking.
Commissioner Antonini:
-An article in the Chronicle mentioned an individual who qualified for a below market-rate property.
-Mortgages are fixed but not home owner association fees.
-We need to educate the public in terms of the steps that need to be taken and show the big picture when buying below market-rate property.
Amit Ghosh:
-I just want to let you know that we are working with the Mayor's Office for additional briefings to address some concerns you have expressed, including affordable housing.
Commissioner Antonini:
-If our regular meeting calendar is long, do not schedule special sessions in the morning.
Commissioner W. Lee:
-I strongly suggest that commissioners meet or call staff when you have questions on certain topics.
-On The Transbay Terminal it would be more efficient to submit questions to staff and get a response to us as a group.
-It would be helpful during Director's Report that you bring to our attention anything in the news you think we should know about.
Commissioner Moore:
-I feel that instead of spending individual time, it would be better to meet and have generalized discussions.That way we all get educated.
-Topics are going to be changing all the time and we could follow a sequence of importance – like, what is coming up that is most urgent?
-I heard President [Supervisor] Peskin suggest that we are picking up the Executive Park construction because of the new consideration of the ballpark.This is a project we might want to have a presentation on.
Director Macris:
-I suggest that next week we have a presentation on the Transbay Terminal because the first three days of next week there will be a panel to review five submissions for the Transbay Tower.Plus we are issuing a request for proposal (RFP), from architectural firm to assist us in the beginning of analysis.It is very timely to hear from you.
-There are a lot of other topics to discuss and you can prioritize them at your convenience.
Commissioner S. Lee
-I do talk to staff and we need to learn how to talk and listen to each other as a body.
Commissioner Olague
-Round table is much better.It invites to dialogue.
-On project presentations, I would like to also hear staff input, but especially from the Supervisor's office of the particular district.
Commissioner Sugaya:
-If possible, I would like to get material in advance for informational hearings.
-I would like a copy of RFP from the Transit Authority for the design competition.
-Informational hearings will be scheduled on Thursdays from 10:30am to 12:30pm when the regular calendar permits with two weeks notice in advance
