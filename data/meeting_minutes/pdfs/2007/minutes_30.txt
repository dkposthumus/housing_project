4.Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Antonini
-A particular property on 27thAvenue was brought to my attention.
-It is not really this particular project per say, but the process that it is indicative.I am not sure it came before us because it was a Cat. Ex. [Categorical Exception]
-Basically what happened was an individual project that had a Cat. Ex. was appealed at the Board of Supervisors and found that it could be potentially historical if a historical map was done of the area.
-This was an addition largely to the back of an existing residential, single-family home.
-It puts them in a position to go forward and complete a neighborhood mapping to find out if it could conceivably be historical.
-I think that this remedy is disproportionate to what is being done and I would like to see a report or briefing on what is happening; the basis and/or policies in place and our role in the determination of these kinds of procedures.
-This has been going on recently.
Mr. Badiner, Zoning Administrator
-Perhaps it might be appropriate for us to comment when we do the Board of Supervisors report.
-We are still trying to figure out all the implications from Tuesday's decisions.
-We might be able to provide some input on that today and some more in the future.
Commissioner Moore
-I would like to share with Commissioners and the public a very innovative way on how the Dutch engaged some unusual solutions to the unsightly presence of television satellite dishes -- making an art out of it.
-I found it remarkable how they turned something rather blightfull into something delightful.
-It came up to my attention that the expired permit for 524 Howard Street has been reinstated.
-I was curious of how that happened without these types of buildings coming back to the Commission?I would like to get an explanation.
Commissioner Alexander
-We have two of those that came forward.There is one on California Street.
-When time limits go pass what we had given, sometimes four or five years, we should see those projects in areas where planning's thinking and urban format may have changed.
-Possibly the neighborhood should be noticed.Help me understand that process and whether or not we have the purview to see those projects again.
Mr. Badiner, Zoning Administrator
-524 Howard Street is a project that was approved by this Commission in 1999 for about 200,000 square feet of office building.
-In 2002, this Commission made a policy that relates to the annual limit projects.The code essentially says that failure to commence should be grounds for reapplication not revoking.
-This Commission by motion indicated that they did not want a reapplication of the permit.They wanted these projects to continue on unless/until we run out of space in an annual amount allocation.
-If you have a number of projects coming in, we would have to look at the previously approved projects whether they are moving ahead or not.Absent that, they are entitled.
-In order to un-entitle them, we would need to schedule a revocation hearing.The policy allows them to continue.
-In this particular project, in early December a determination was requested on whether the project still had Planning Commission entitlement, absent a reapplication of the permit.
-Given the Commission policy, I determined that in fact the Commission action was still valid and issued the letter.
-Subsequent to that, a member of the project sponsor's team pulled the building permit.
-I indicated some concerns because I consulted with the Transbay Terminal and Redevelopment Agency before saying that it was valid.
-We still wanted to look at the design and make sure it was appropriate and if they still met the conditions of approval.
-We were surprised to see that a building permit was issued.We suspended it.
-In discussion with the project sponsor, we indicated that they would have to come back to the department and the Commission for at least an informal review and they have to meet all current Planning Code requirements unless they could demonstrate that they did not apply.
Commissioner Alexander
-We should calendar a discussion on that issue because I see some problems coming up given all the changes in planning in the city.
-We should examine this and see if we can find a space on our calendar to see that.July 26th?
Commissioner Moore
-Could we, in the mean time, ask to look briefly at these projects without them being approved?I am very concerned that this leaves a lot of room for just tag and pull.
-I believe that a permit issued in 1999 needs to be looked at under a completely different set of circumstances.
-It is not that we know better, but to bring it back for a broader discussion between all of us participating actively in the Transbay Terminal project; new ideas for Downtown; and Market-Octavia.All of these buildings are not small buildings.
-They are significant buildings and we owe it to each other to just take a comprehensive look.In the meantime until we decide on a new policy or to reinstate the old policy, I would like to suggest that we bring these projects back.
Mr. Badiner, Zoning Administrator
-I just want to emphasize that they are subject to current fees.The intent was to bring it back to the Commission as an informational item for review.
-We would have to determine if there are further changes that are being made.Absent being revoked, it is still in place.
-There is no question that we would be happy to bring it back to you.
Commissioner Alexander
Commissioner Sugaya
-I assume that part of that informational hearing would include all those projects that are sitting out there with 2, 3, 5 or 9-year permits.
-In the latest BUSINESS TIMES, there is a section on San Francisco structures.And they are in three categories:under construction, permitting, or still waiting for approval.
-I would like staff to look at it and give a quick updated on the status of seeking approval.
Commissioner W. Lee
-Early this week, there was a court decision regarding the Housing Element and I would like to propose a closed session with the City Attorney's Office to discuss the court's decision.
-Regarding our hearing on the three-year timetable [annual limit for projects], can staff present at that time what the implications would be if we add new requirements to those projects?
C.DIRECTOR'S REPORT(Tape IA)
5.Director's Announcements [This item followed item 6.]
Mr. Badiner, Zoning Administrator reported:
-Commissioners, I would like to take a moment to mention that you received in your packets a memorandum from Ms. Forbes about block book notation [BBN] fees.
-We reviewed our fees last year and as part of that we changed our block book notations.Previously, the fee had been $25 for the first block and $10 for any additional block.
-On September 1, 2006, we changed the code and made it $25 for the first lot and $10 for each additional lot.
-Neighborhood Associations expressed concerns about that.The Board of Supervisors sponsored modifications to the Code that for an individual it would be $25 for the first lot and $10 for each additional lot and for Neighborhood Associations it would be $25 for the first block and $10 for any additional block.
-The next piece is 77 Oak Street.There were some discrepancies between the plans and the 3-dimensional renderings and it was requested that we review it.
-Also, the plan did not really expressed well what was going on in a way that was readable.
-We spoke to the project sponsor.We reviewed the design of the building.Project sponsor put a packet together that is more reflective in 3-dimension what was being proposed.
-It shows in better detail the window design and molding.The project sponsor decided to put in highly quality windows throughout the building.
-This is for your review and if you have any questions you may contact us.
6.Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
AnMarie Rodgers reported:
Land Use and Economic Committee:
A.Hearing on Planning Code Amendments for PDR Districts.Supervisor Maxwell requested this informational hearing.No Action Taken.
Budget Committee:
A.The Planning Department presented the budget for 2007-2008 Fiscal Year.Passed to the full Board [of Supervisors].The Board analyst suggested some minor changes and our Department for the most part supported them.The Department will come back to the Commission with the full update of the budget process in late July or early August.
Board of Supervisors
A.Re-appeal of the alternative review process.This Amendment to the Planning Code would delete language that expired approximately four years ago.Passed unanimously.
B.Pacific Avenue Neighborhood Commercial District Rezoning.The Department sponsored this rezoning to create a new district where currently commercial 2 controls are in place.It would also eliminate a garment manufacturing special use district.Passed unanimously.
C.2462 27thAvenue Cat Ex [Categorical Exemption] appeal.It did not come to the Commission.There was a related Discretionary Review hearing in November 2006 and there was no appeal taken at that time.
The appellant claimed that the property was a historic resource and needed to have a full Historic Resource Evaluation Report or HRER.Members of the Board sighted the dwelling expert's arguments andupheldthe appellant request.This position means that a full HRER would be required.
D.Introductions:

SPEAKERS
Bok Pon, Chinatown Neighborhood Association
-I am very happy that the Planning Commission and many activists are forging ahead for more affordable housing.
-[Submitted packages of information to the Commission about abuse of the system from an individual.It was made public in the newspaper.]
-This individual forged their address and other information.This person claimed to live at 731 Sacramento Street.That building is a historic building housing the Chinese Chamber of Commerce.It is not a residence.
-He requested that the Commission look into this case for its legality and see if this person is entitled to this affordable housing.
-She is a single person living in a two-bedroom affordable housing unit with a parking space.
-Make sure that affordable housing built in the city is for families living in San Francisco.
-Also, while growing up, at every single government meeting always the Pledge the Allegiance was recited.I was surprised that this Commission does not show respect for our flag.
Mrs. Burrell
-I object to the three-minute limit for public comments because it opens up the opportunity for harassment.
-San Francisco claims equity in any social service corporation developed here as well as architectural projects.
-I was violated for promises with coordination and facilitation for thirteen years.
-Now, I have been homeless for eight months because it is not legal to sell me medical services.
-Medicare housing is medical services.If it were not legal, I would not ask for it.I got evicted in October 2006.
-At this point, they are charging $240 for a case manager service that violates the management merits.
-I need social service support outside of organized crime that in every nation of the world is doing business as social service
