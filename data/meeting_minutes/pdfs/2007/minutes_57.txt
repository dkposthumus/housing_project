CONSIDERATION OF ADOPTIONof aCOMMISSION POLICYfor the review of building permits and approvals in the Eastern Neighborhoods prior to the adoption of the Eastern Neighborhoods area plans and code amendments.
SPEAKERS
Ruby Smith
-I am totally amazed about this memorandum and the impact it's going to have on developments that are in the process.
Eugene Pak
Brett Gladstone
-I am here to propose that the grandfather date applies as follows: that those properties that apply after the date of the new ordinance be effective by the new ordinance.
-Developers have no idea the risks they're taking when buying in this area and how they are affected by the 2660 Harrison decision.
-That decision told them for the first that they would be subject to extensive environmental reviews and fees.
-Instruct staff and economist looking into what the fees should be considering property taxes and how to recapture them.
-You are requiring as policy that 40 percent of units be two or more bedrooms.You are actually cutting down the number of units and increasing the cost of construction.
-You may be helping the situation by relieving the density limitations but also heading the opposite way by increasing the size of units.
Matthew Brennan
-It basically says that before purchasing a project to develop, punch all the numbers - price, development cost, fees [attorney, architect, engineer, city].
Keely Ferguson
-Part of my job is to analyze development sites and accurately disclose possibilities/cost to build.
-We follow policies and codes, especially Planning Commission Resolution #16727 when giving advise to clients on sites in the Eastern Neighborhoods.
Josh Nasvik
-We look at agendas, minutes and resolutions when recommending to our clients what they can build.
James Nunemacker
Colleen Coter
-I work with many developers and have been closely monitoring the process since the adoption of resolution 16727.
-This resolution does not make any reference to community fees and changing the rules later is unfair.
Mark Brennan
-Local developers follow the rules and changing those rules in the middle of a process would [negatively] impact San Francisco.
Michael
Lauren Ladd
-It seems that this body should concern itself with the climate of tenuous regulatory [policies] and the uncertainty that plagues our city.
-The reasonable expectations that resolution 16727 engendered included no addition of community fees or a grandfather provision.
-Shared his experience with a client that went through the process with hearing presentations and all with no mention of community fees.
Gary Gee
-Read a letter sent in opposition to any proposal by the Planning Commission to apply new community or development fees retroactively.
Ger O'Keeffe
Brian McGee
-It seems that every time we come to the Commission it is to talk about fees and not projects.
-It does not make any sense since we are not using the streets and landscape continuously throughout the year, every body is.
-Urged the Commission to consider the cost of the fees and at the very least to have a grandfather clause that protects the projects in the pipeline.
Joe Cassidy
-Every week since last November, the construction industry has been under attack either at this Commission or at the Board of Supervisors.
John O'Connor
-Interest rates have increased 17 times and construction costs went up 100 percent in eight months.
Louis Rarano
-Keep in mind that projects in the pipeline are not moving at all because of the Eastern Neighborhood debacle.
-These developments would provide affordable hosing with no cost to the City it they are allowed to move ahead.
Richie Hart
Fergus O'Sullivan
-We all are nervous for waiting a long time to develop and then unexpectedly this community impact comes along.
-The developers here today are part of the city and they work hard to keep affordable housing in San Francisco.
Stephen McElroy
Grace Shanahan
-Read a memorandum prepared by Director Macris [page 5] about the grandfather clause to protect projects in the pipeline.
Kieran Buckley
David O'Keeffe
Angus McCarthy
-You have the power to honor the system you have in place along with the Planning Department.
Mike Cassidy
John Pollard
-It is ironic that the Contract State License Board says that we have to give a fixed price for every project we do.
-In other industries in the State of California you would have to comply by giving cost within one percent.
Charles Breidinger
-A lot of problems in the city come from the unbalance of downtown office developments versus the amount of housing available.
-I would like to know how the figures were done to come up with an impact fee of $13 a square foot for housing and $4 a square foot for commercial.
-Imposing fees would reduce the value of land in the Eastern Neighborhoods, which would have a very large economic impact.
[Unidentified]
Seamys Canning
Paul Troudelius
-The City Attorney's Office advised that you conduct a nexus study program to build projects in the Eastern Neighborhood.
-In the State of California you cannot apply an assessment fee or tax without showing how the money is going to be spent.It was not done.
Redmond Ryons
Leo Cassidy
-It is hard to believe that this Department does not consider a grandfather clause for projects in process for three years.
Jim Keith
Julie Leadbetter
Nick Pagaulatos
-The Planning Department has acknowledged that all market-rate projects have had a negative impact in our community.
Kim
-Why are you considering these projects and why are they on the agenda if the plan is in process?
Jerry
-Housing rates have increased in San Francisco, while everywhere else in the country they are reducing.
Sean Keighran
-Our organization had representatives at each of the seven Planning hearings that lead to the adoption of resolution 16727.
Alice Barkley
-Today's discussion points to the failure of this Department to plan for the past ten years.
-Your Department did not assign projects to staff for 24 months in the Eastern Neighborhoods.

-Addition would affect view of adjacent property -it takes away the view of four windows.
Ms. Carter

Divisadero Corridor Manager for the Neighborhood Market Place Initiative.
-Our goal is to create a strong neighborhood commercial corridor to make it a better place to live, work, shop and eat.
-During late 2005 and early 2006, my office facilitated three community meetings to ask the neighborhood what areas of Divisadero Street needed improvement.
-Opening the Department of Motor Vehicles [DMV] lot for public parking during nights and weekends was identified as one of the top issues.
-Participants believe that having more parking near the commercial corridor would greatly enhance the ability for customers to shop there.
-It would attract more people and help our neighborhood economically.
-We have received requests to use the DMV lot for public parking from City College.
-We have been working with DMV since 2004 to develop this idea of using the lot for public parking.
Regina Dick-Endrizzi, Supervisor Mirkarimi's Office

The proposed project would preserve and renovate two existing historic buildings and construct three new buildings above a new below-grade parking podium. The project would contain approximately 242,185 square feet (sq.ft.), including about 179 residential units, a 5,262 sq.ft. restaurant space, 11,434 sq.ft. of retail space, a 2,393 sq.ft. day-care, a below-grade parking garage accessed from Illinois Street with about 157 parking spaces, 50 bicycle spaces, and two off-street loading spaces. The two new structures along Third Street would be 35 feet in height at the property line, and 50 feet in height beyond 0a 20-foot setback. The new building proposed on Illinois Street would range from 55 to 65 feet in height. The project site is located in an M-2 (Heavy Industrial) zoning district and a 50-X height and bulk district. The proposed project would require aGeneral Planamendment and rezoning to create a temporary "Central Waterfront Plan Demonstration District."
