Informational hearing on Planning Code Amendments to Industrial Districts in Bayview Hunters Point-Informational Item.The Department is preparing a set of zoning modifications for certain M-1 and M-2 designated areas in the Bayview Hunters Point district.The Department is proposing this zoning update to implement various objectives from the Bayview Hunters Point Area Plan, which seeks to retain space for jobs and light industrial activities and to reduce land use conflicts between housing and industry in the Bayview.In general, the Code amendments would continue to permit a wide range of light and contemporary industrial activities, while restricting the size of retail and office development in the area.The zoning revisions will also standardize and codify existing land use policies and controls that currently discourage or prohibit residential development in these industrial zones.

-522 Stanyan Street is a house with architectural merit and care should be taken with ventilation, light and air protection.

-It would impact negatively mid-block open space.

-There is no need for the big deck.
-It should not be larger than a bedroom to maximize space, add value and enhance the house.
