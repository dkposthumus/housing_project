9.Commission Comments/Questions(Tape IA)
Commissioner W. Lee
-I had the opportunity to meet with one of the Housing Authority Commissioners.
-I was able to get a copy of the Housing Authority background history and I think it is applicable to housing we have in the city.
-I would like all commissioners to have a copy of it because the information could be helpful.
Commissioner Antonini
-I received some State Legislation that was passed in 2005 - Senate bill 1880 from Holland Wards.
-It basically says that if a project sponsor is asked to provide a higher level of affordability, under the State Law, the local jurisdiction must give height bonus density
-My question is how we are handling this situation?
-If we are providing bonuses something should be given in return.
-Asked the City Attorney for an interpretation on this law.
Commissioner Moore
-I would like to bring to the attention of the Commission and article about Mission Bay - Rule by Design.
-Encouraged everybody to read the article and engage in a conversation to work closely with the Department to answer challenges proposed by this article.
-As we enter the Eastern Neighborhood Plan, I would like to educate myself on issues surrounding housing design.
-I would like to have a presentation from AIA - local architects to look at current planning code implications on providing infrastructure housing and how to make them more affordable to build.
-Another way is to show examples of mixed-use development in the bay region that integrates design solutions to make contributions to the public realm.
-To show how below market-rate units are integrated into the design.
-How economics work in projects providing affordable units without relying on market-rate and inclusionary housing.
-APA is sponsoring Great Places in America and I would like San Francisco's Octavia Boulevard to be included.
-In a private citizen role, I would like to get background on Octavia Boulevard.Who initiated the project?I'd like to put the package together and submit it.
Commissioner Alexander
-Presentation through AIA would be important.
-We should schedule it on a fifth Thursday to not interrupt our regular hearings.
Commissioner Antonini
-I agree, it would be an interesting presentation.
Commissioner Olague
-I just want to remind you to calendar a discussion of our Rules and Regulations to revamp our system and policies.
Commissioner Alexander
-It is scheduled for May 24.
Commissioner S. Lee
-I would like to request a report to this Commission about a consultant hired last year to help with internal process.
-I would be very interesting to find out how we are doing; to compare our operations to other places.
Commissioner Alexander
-I think it is very important to have a report from that consultant, especially now that we are in the process of next year's budget.
Commissioner Sugaya
-Asked staff to give us an update on Transbay Authority's Transbay Terminal and our own Department's RFP.
-I was reading in Urban Land an issue that was devoted to Chicago.
-There was a short article about employee-assisted housing.
-I would like to know if that program exists in San Francisco.Maybe the Major's Office of Housing could send us information about that.
-Regarding Commissioner Moore's request for an AIA presentation, it would be helpful to have at least one architect from San Diego.
Mr. Badiner, Zoning Administrator
-We understand that the Board of Supervisors allocated this amount to the Mayor's Office of Housing for acquisition/rehabilitation of affordable housing for families, seniors, disables and youth.
-Legislation is before the Mayor and he has not made a decision whether or not to sign it.
Commissioner Antonini
-I would encourage the Mayor to veto this measure.
-First, because when there is extra money it is wise to reserve it.
-Second, issues like this should have come through the Commission for commentaries.
-Third, the City has a responsibility to care for certain things like streets and parks - unlike housing, which is a shared and many people are part of it.
Commissioner Olague
-Where is this money going?
Mr. Badiner, Zoning Administrator
-We have a list that says:
- $28,000,000 to Mayor's Office of Housing for acquisition, construction, and rehabilitation for affordable family housing, housing for seniors and persons with disabilities, persons exiting the system of care.
- $5,000,000 for repair services on public housing developments.
- $2,500,000 for real ownership opportunities for tenant's projects.
- $ 550,000 Major's Office of Community Development for acquisition of specific sites on the Mission-Dolores area.
Commisioner Olague
-It is an honest way to use this money.
-If we want to keep families in the city, we have to think of ways to do so.
-I hope the Mayor does not veto it.
Commissioner Sugaya
-I think the Mayor's Office of Housing would be able to deliver and combined with some other funding.
-Housing is very important for the City as well as streets and parks.
-Fundamental problem in California is that every community is short of money because of Proposition 13.
Commissioner Alexander
-I would urge the Mayor and our own department to allocate money for trainings on Fair Housing Law.
SPEAKERS

-I brought invitations to the Commissioners for our 3rdyear Anniversary - Executive Park on Saturday May 19th.
