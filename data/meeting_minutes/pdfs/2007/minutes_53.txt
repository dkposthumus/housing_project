-The stakeholders process really, clearly and very candidly showed the pitfalls and the successes are on both Departments.
-You should consider that while the Director mentioned that there are administrative issues, there is some overlap to the entitlement process.

-Finally, there is one other thing that plugs both Commissions into this process because you are going to recognize that there are budget concerns.
-We have learned that we are not taking every opportunity for fees and we are making recommendations to scoop that.
-When the next fiscal year budget comes forward, ask the Directors where is the staffing for this BPR because that is the only way that is going to succeed.
