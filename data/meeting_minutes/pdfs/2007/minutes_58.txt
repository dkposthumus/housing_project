Â·Future Meetings/Agendas.At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Olague
-In reviewing the Action List, I was wondering about the first two items from May when we requested a report on the consultant hired last year to evaluate the internal process of the Department.
-I was wondering if you could let us know when we would have that information and how we are doing comparing our operation to like agencies.
-The second one was a request to have a discussion to learn how the Department moves forward RFPs without Commission involvement.
-Those two items have been sitting around since May.
Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator
-I will talk with Ms. John-Baptiste to follow up because both are under her purview.
Commissioner Olague
-I spoke with Ms. Avery about scheduling a Transbay special hearing at 10a.m. sometime in November; we are working on that.
Commissioner Antonini
-In the same regard, and I think there was a concurrence of the Commissioners, I requested to schedule a hearing about the tall building issue and asked to have various authorities throughout the world in this area be part of the hearing.
-I do not know if that is being calendared or being noted, but I wanted to point that out.
-There was another article in the Chronicle's Editorial section that I think is an issue that the public is interested to hear about.
-It would be good to have some testimony from structural engineers and architects and others involved in tall buildings, particularly in other areas of the world that are seismic zones.
Commissioner Alexander
-We did talk about that and I do not see it on the Action List and we can work with Ms. Avery to find a day to calendar that.
Commissioner Moore
-For a long time I wanted to ask for a hearing on Treasure Island.I think the project is at a state of maturity where it should be more that just a staff update.
-It should be a full presentation by the architects, planners and TI to have a full understanding because we are moving into the draft EIR stage soon.
-I think we should have an understanding of that before it happens.
Commissioner Antonini
-I just have a question in regards to the process and Commissioner Moore mentioned that in addition to the impact report we should have a special hearing.
-I just do not want to have a duplication type of situation where we are dealing with the same issues.So as long as it is a different subject &
Commissioner Moore
-It is a different subject because the Draft EIR is just being scoped and I think that it is very important to understand the project prior to moving to that stage.
Commissioner Sugaya
-I think Mr. Badiner held a hearing on 648 Howard or Hawthorne with TDR's and if I can get information in a memorandum at some point about that.
Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator
-It is still under consideration and they are probably finding another way to do that and at this time I am not inclined to grant the variance.
-I think they are pursuing their other options and if that changes I will let you know.That would be 1 Hawthorne at Howard Street.
Commissioner Sugaya
-Secondly, in the announcements for the new director through the Mayor's Office, there was an indication that the Acting Director would stay on in a special project capacity.
-Could we ask the Mayor's Office what they have in mind with respect to those projects?
Commissioner Olague
-I support that request also because I would be interested in knowing what those special projects are.
Commissioner Alexander
-I would not limit the request to just knowing the special projects but understanding what the role is with regard to the new director and understanding what the new vision of responsibilities would be.
Commissioner Moore
-I just wanted to point out that there is a small article in the Chronicle informing us that the court put the updated plan on hold and that is quite important for this group.
-The State Supreme Court did this yesterday and what I found interesting is that it was really published in this very few inches [measuring the space with her fingers].

SPEAKERS
Jamie Cherry, Regarding 1135, 1137 and 1139 Green Street
-I request that you direct the Department to issue 311-notice for this project and postponed the October 18 hearing until after the notice has been sent.
-The proposed project would construct 2 story structures behind the historic 1870 Green Street retaining wall.It has been under review by this Department for more than two years.
-This construction could jeopardize the stability and integrity of this landmark resulting in demolition.
John Bardis, Regarding 1135, 1137 and 1139 Green Street
-I asked the Department to send notices to residents and property owners about this project and hold the hearing after that notification and there has not been any response on this.
-The Commission should look at this very carefully and postpone the hearing on this project.
Moniu Pilpel, Planning Department Codes and Enforcement
-I sent a letter about three weeks ago about issuance of temporary use permits.I got a response from the enforcement staff but half of the questions were not really answered.
-Conditions of the permit have not been met and Mr. Badiner issued a temporary use permit ignoring the conditions from the Board of Appeals and the Codes and I ask you to question him about this property at 19thand Sloat Avenue.
Robert Omalley, Diplomatic Work
-I have letters of introduction from the Germany Consulate and the City Attorney has them.
-I have been working with the United Nations through the consulate to put a Campus of Environmental Studies here in San Francisco and probably to be at the former Federal Building and that should be coming up soon.
Sue Hestor
-We have the opportunity to do something right and that has to do with transportation with the housing density that we are planning, especially with the projects on Market Street.
-We are changing housing in that area and the Planning Department really needs to tackle transportation analysis and transit improvement.

INSTITUTIONAL MASTER PLAN: HEALTH PLANNER: BOARD FILE 070678-Forwarding a proposed ordinance with a recommendation to the Board of Supervisors amending the Planning Code (Section 304.5)to require a qualified health planner retained by the Department of Public Health to analyze the relationship to citywide health care needs of medical institutions' institutional master plans, revisions, and conditional use applications, to provide comments to the Planning Department, making environmental findings, and making findings of consistency with the General Plan and priority policies of Planning Code Section 101.1.
Preliminary Recommendation:Approval
(Continued from Regular Meeting of October 4, 2007)
SPEAKERS
Jon Lau, Office of Supervisor Sophie Maxwell
-There are two other co-authors to the legislation, Supervisors Ammiano and Pier.
-Two basic components: add language to the existing institutional master plan requiring review by a health planner and clarifying definitions and thresholds in the IMP section of the code.
-The goal is simply to inject objective information and analysis from those in the health planning profession.
-We have to acknowledge that there are a multitude of issues surrounding medical institutions today.
-We want to be clear that this piece of legislation does not attempt to tackle those complex issues but simply build off the existing noticing and procedural requirements for institutions.
-It would add information from health professionals to the discussion around IMP for certain types of medical facilities.
-This ordinance seeks to bring additional clarity around the existing institutional master plan requirements that would be of benefit to the project sponsor, neighborhood activists and City staff.
-I believe you are going to hear from a few members of the Health Commission today as well, and certainly the Supervisor continues to welcome their involvement on this issue.
-Many have suggested language modifications to the ordinance around the issue of more formal input from the Health Commission on specific IMP.
Jim Soos, Department of Public Health
-We are here to express our support to the proposed changes to the Institutional Master Plan review process.
-Our own Health Commission has scheduled a hearing on this item as well for the 16thof October and there is a resolution attached to that.
Marc Snyder
-We are seeing many facilities changing and it is important that the City take a look at what is going on with health care facilities and its distribution.
-I support this proposal for a health planner and the amendments that are before you today.
Ron Smith, President of the Hospital Council of Northern and Central California
-We are asking the Commission to vote against the proposed ordinance because we have many great concerns outlined in the letter I've just submitted to you.
-The City has not adopted a plan describing health care needs and what role the hospitals ought to play.
-The State reserves the sole authority for health care planning under California Health and Safety Codes 12715 and 127560.
Heather Otanez, Saint Mary's Medical Center
-I urge you to vote no on this proposal because the financial impact on hospitals would be very significant.
-We already do a lot of mandated reporting to the State.
Richard Thomason, Policy Director for the Service Employees International Union
-We are here to support the ordinance as being appropriate updating of the planning requirements, which it has been in the book for a long time.
-In fact, we would like it to go further by putting in the conditional use permitting process some real planning oversight to really accomplish the objective of the policy.
JimIllig, Member of the Health Commission
-You have received a letter from the President of the Health Commission outlining some of our specific recommendations.
-We think that on Tuesday the Commission is going to vote in favor of this legislation for providing an important tool for policy makers.
Abbie Yient, Senior Director of Mission Advocacy and Community Health Center
-Our concern with the ordinance is that as currently written it has considerable operational impacts.Please take a close look to prevent those impacts.
-You should defer this consideration until more health considerations can be heard at the scheduled hearing of the Health Commission next week or have a joint hearing.
Paul Wermer
-I'm in full support of this ordinance and I urge you to go further and make recommendations to address a couple of the issues raised earlier.
-There is no health needs assessment for the City and it should add provisions to improve community input.
Berthy Campbell-Ward, Cathedral Hill Neighbor Association
-I'm in support of the ordinance because the City needs to step in.
-We have all these private health care people and operations and we need to make certain that the City gets adequate coverage.
Wayne Hu, Chinese Hospital
-The health planner should evaluate hospitals on City wide goals.
-We need to make sure that it also allows independent hospitals to continue their operations.
Starchild
-I oppose this measurement because the money used to hire this employee can be better spent to give free health care to the homeless, for example.
Sue Hestor
-Please send this legislation on with a recommendation asking the Board of Supervisors to listen and talk to the Health Department Commission.
-I would ask this Commission to agree to adopt an outreach plan as a policy and show how it should be done by staff when a project is coming through.
ACTION:Approved

Informational Presentation and Hearing to Receive Planning Commission's Comments on Draft Program Environmental Impact Report. -Water System Improvement Program- The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) is sponsoring a proposed program, which consists of a series of facility improvement projects and a water supply strategy that, together, implement the SFPUC's service goals and system performance objectives for the regional water system in the areas of water quality, seismic reliability, delivery reliability, and water supply through the year 2030. The proposed program runs through several California counties, including Tuolumne, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Alameda, Santa Clara, San Mateo and San Francisco counties. Additional hearings were held throughout the proposed program area, including one on September 20, 2007 before the Planning Commission. The SFPUC and the Planning Department will provide information to the Planning Commission about the Water System Improvement Program and the Draft Program Environmental Impact Report; the Draft Program Environmental Impact Report analyzes the environmental impacts of the Water System Improvement Program.
Preliminary Recommendation:No Action Required. Informational presentation and hearing to receive comments on the Program EIR.
NOTE:THE COMMENT PERIOD FOR THIS DRAFT PROGRAM ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT HAS BEEN EXTENDED. WRITTEN COMMENTS MAY BE SUBMITTED TO THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT UNTIL 5:00 P.M. ON OCTOBER 15, 2007.
SPEAKERS
Susan Leal, General Manager of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission
-We are pleased to be here today and to have the opportunity to give a brief presentation on our water system.
Tony Irons, Deputy General Manager of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission
-The first task before us was to create a program that can be reviewed by the public and allow public comments.
-There are four categories: seismic, delivery reliability, water quality, and supply.
-In the early 90's; the Bay Area Economic Forum published documents that stated that in the event of a major earthquake, the economic impact on that seasonal water would be catastrophic.
-The State kind of responded by passing three legislations back then.
-There would be great danger to the Bay Area with health issues if we do not do this.
-We have established a time table for the end of 2014 to have this program completed because of the danger to health and safety should an earthquake occur.
-We have very aggressive goals.More in fact more than any other jurisdiction because we cross three earthquake faults.
-The delivery reliability is that this system has to have this major program done for it because it has not had maintenance for 70 years.
-Water quality stipulates that we will comply with all present and known future water regulations either from State and/or local government.
-Water supply identifies two overarching issues: delivery capacity on an average of 300 million gallons of water a day to the overall service area; and that during a draught there would be a maximum rationing of 20 percent of average delivery of water.
-Those guidelines provide us as management to this program the ability to design all of these individual projects as an interwoven continuum and establish the design for each one.
-All of the improvements are a result of the deterioration of the system and the necessity to provide for earthquake protection.
-This is a City run and City managed program.
-Our biggest challenge is to get contractors to bid on these projects because of its size.
Peter Drekmeier, Director of the Tuolumne River Trust
-Our organization is 100 percent supportive of the seismic upgrade to the system.However, we are very concerned about the proposal to divert up to 25 million gallons of water per day.
-We have worked with the Sierra Club and Clean Water Action to provide comments and there are over 60 pages and a short executive summary.
Art Jensen, General Manager for the Bay Area Water Supply and Conservation Agency
-We reviewed the report.It is very conscientious and we believe is meeting CEQA [California Environment Quality Act] requirements.
-There are two areas that we think needs to be improved.It does not convey the risk and urgency for building the water system without delay; and the impacts to public health and safety would be dramatic.
John Rizzo, Sierra Club
-We fully support the critical seismic upgrades and our comments focus on the inadequacy of the Environmental Review of the proposal to divert an additional 25 million gallons per day.
-Our comments include: inadequate analysis of the impacts inside Yosemite National Park, faulty growth statement relying on old public studies, inadequate mitigation, lack of consideration of global climate change, and others inadequacies as well.
ACTION:This was an informational presentation and action by the Commission is not required.Commissioner Sugaya was excused.

SPEAKERS
Tracy - Reuben and Junius
-We contacted HUD [Department of Housing and Urban Development], The Mayor's Office of Housing, and The Tenderloin Housing Clinic and we did not find evidence, restriction or conditions on the basement space.
-There would be sufficient light, air and open space for the four units and they will be affordable to middle income residents.
-The project is consistent with the City's transfer and preservation policy.
-We are increasing density within an existing envelope.
Robert Gimelli
-I am not opposed to increasing housing or density in the City but I find this a poor choice of space.It is like warehousing people.
-It would be a more appropriate use of this space to create community space and have two units in the front to satisfy both needs: amenities and housing.
Starchild
-Questioned whether there is federal funding involved in this project.
-If there is federal money involved, the public has a say in this and you should try to do the best for the people that are the neediest.

-It is about land use and safe access to Medical Cannabis.
Walter Henry Jones
-I have appeared before this Commission in favor of a number of dispensaries but this is not one of those occasions.
Michael Aldrich
-This is one of the few places that is 1,000 feet away from schools, allows on site smoking, and is a safe place for patients to get off the street.
-Patients are the ones who choose whether they want to go or not to this dispensary.
Starchild
-The most important thing is that we need to keep open every single dispensary in San Francisco.
Albert Blais
-The sanctuary status is being violated.
-The club is good but the owner is the bad apple in the bunch and has got to go.

Michelle Aldrich
-We need to keep all the dispensaries open because a lot of them are not going to pass and they serve their patients well.

SPEAKERS
Terrance, Project Sponsor's Representative
-My previous comments really were directed to both clubs and if there is any specific question or issues of the Commissioners, I would be happy to answer them.
-The two clubs are similarly situated.The possibility to have legally onsite smoking is good for patients.It gives them a place to be medicated, eat and socialize to prevent isolation.
Jon Martinelli, Access of Love
-You have in your packages a petition from 1500 people and I would like to add 87 more.
-This place is not accessible for disable people.It is for profit.
[No name stated]

-I represent people in wheelchairs and this facility is not ADA [American Disabilities Act] accessible.
George Price
-This place is not wheelchair accessible.It is a big issue and they should not be operating.

-They give tickets for social events, massage therapy, and food.The sponsor himself has driven the medicine to patients.
Denise Dorey
-This landmark status should not be excused to avoid ADA compliance.
Michael Aldrich
-I do not see any reason in terms of safe access for all patients to close one of only two dispensaries left in the Castro.
-The Board of Supervisors has given this dispensary the opportunity to improve their wheelchair access and to work out the landmark issue.
-We should approve this facility as proposed.
Starchild
-You should consider hearing the items in the order of the number of people present to speak on them.
-The issue of accessibility is not economically feasible and you should be able to decide what you want to do with your own property.You should have the choice what to do with it.
Albert Blais
-This is about the cannabis community.
-We have to work together and the owner of this club just will not do it.
Andrew Abels
-[Shared own experience with the club and the services they provide.]
-We need that place to stay open.
David Goldman

Michael
-We need to keep this club open because it is the first club ever recognized by local officials.

Kevin Reed

-This collective deserves the right to operate just like every other collective located in this City.
-Give them that chance.
Russell Kyle
-We are supposed to be a sanctuary city.It is not community when one party goes after the other in Federal Court.It is not justifiable.
