·Inquiries/Announcements. 
        Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or
        inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas. 
        At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a
        Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda
        of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Antonini:
I wanted to mention that
        I was fortunate enough to be at the 49ers game. I think I saw a crowd that was
        the most passionate and focused that I have ever seen. Some commentators on
        national television commented on the enthusiasm. There were a few fans wearing
        New Orleans gear.  I think it is important that we are respectful to those from
        other cities and those rooting for other teams, because they bring revenue into
        our City. There is common kindness, but also we do not want to be bad hosts.
        There is another phenomenon that was mentioned, the fact that there is a
        collective identification with San Francisco. We noticed this with the Giants.
        It will happen again this Sunday. People come into San Francisco, even if they
        are not fortunate to have game tickets, because the want to be part of what is
        happening here. This is wonderful for business. It is particularly true on
        situations where games are played in the heart of cities. It is one of the
        reasons we have seen a number of franchises in all major sports moving their
        facilities from suburban locations to urban locations, simply because of this
        phenomenon, where people identify with the city with which the team represents.
        This certainly was the case when I grow up in the Livermore Valley.  I was a
        49er fan. We all think of ourselves, even when we are not San Franciscans, as
        being San Francisco. It is important that we collectively are enthusiastic, but
        we [must] also be good hosts and good neighbors and good to anyone who can visit
        our City in all instances.
Commissioner Borden:
I support Commissioner
        Antonini’s comments. I wanted to ask staff a question. You have seen in the
        media about the Gold Dust Lounge. It has been an institution since 1931 in its
        location.The reports have been that the new tenant is proposed to be a retail tenant. The
        existing use is a restaurant. The zoning on that spot -- would it be something
        we have to deal with?It might be something that is an over-the-counter permit, but I do not know if
        it is something we would have an ability to weigh in on.
Scott Sanchez, Zoning
        Administrator:
I will research the
        matter. It is likely in a C-3 zoning district and is principally permitted. We
        can research it further.
Commissioner Borden:
          Thank you.
Commissioner Sugaya:
I do not remember all the
        facts, but there was a recent article noting that the office vacancy rate in the
        area of South of Market is now 0. I think they are breaking it up-- south of
        market appeared to  be broken into two parts, one further south toward the
        stadium, indicated as zero. Then closer to Market Street, there were more
        high-rise developments. It was around 11% or so.The highest vacancy rates were toward Civic Center. It seemed to indicate from
        the article that there is a need for ongoing office space in the City.
President Miguel:
During the past few weeks,
        I had a number of conversations regarding redistricting in the City.I also testified at the Board of Supervisors, Land Use hearing on the Mayor and
        David Chiu's Legislation regarding the 1% for art fee expansion. That item is
        being worked on and is slowly getting together. I have had conversations with
        several neighborhood groups regarding liquor licenses in Lower Polk, and Polk
        Street in general, and also with the Port, the Market Street Advisory Group that
        I chair.  I want to compliment Department staff - David Alumbaugh and Neil
        Hrushowy - they have been doing yeoman work on this, a fairly large group of
        both consultants and advisers that are not the easiest to deal with, because we
        are dealing with some well-earned egos, I think in this case. They have been
        involved in City design for many years. They are doing an excellent job on that.
        SPUR had an interesting noontime forum yesterday. Steve Wertheim represented the
        Department. It was about Regional Growth and Transportation.  It was extremely
        informative. I was at a meeting on Urban Habitat with the Assistant City Manager
        for Oakland as the keynote speaker. The President of the Oakland Planning
        Commission and a member of the Richmond Planning Commission both were among the
        graduates of this training class for people to be involved in commissions and
        boards in the Bay Area, particularly minorities. It was very good.
6.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
I did not expect to be up
        so soon. I want to acknowledge that I will be out of the office Monday through
        Wednesday of next week.  Bill Wycko will be in charge of the Department during
        that time. As I understand it, there is no report of a meeting this week for the
        Board of Supervisors.
7.Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of
        Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
BOARD OF
        SUPERVISORS:
No Report
BOARD OF APPEALS:
The Board of Appeals did
        meet. They had an Election of Officers. Vice President Garcia was elevated to
        the position of President. Commissioner Fung was nominated to be Vice President.
        There are two vacancies on the Board of Appeals. The mayoral appointee Rich
        Hills has been nominated, and there is a vacancy left from Commissioner Goh
        which is still vacant. There is no one nominated to fill that position. The next
        hearing will be on the February eighth. There was an appeal on a variance
        decision letter I had granted at 995 DeHaro. That was upheld by the Board of
        Appeals. The interesting note about that is that there was a building at the
        rear of the lot that had been relocated from a property on Vermont in 1949, in
        order to accommodate the creation of the Bayshore Freeway. I said this was an
        extraordinary circumstance to grant the subdivision. There was also a
        jurisdiction request, 234 9THSt., and the person who requested it
        may be here to speak at public comment. The application was subject to Section
        312 about this, but she did not file D.R. during that time period. There was a
        question about the requirement to create mailing labels for the abutting
        properties. There is a question whether or not that is an appropriate
        requirement.
HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:
D.        
        GENERALPUBLIC COMMENT – 15 MINUTES
At this time,
        members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the
