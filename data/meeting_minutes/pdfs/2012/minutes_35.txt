Review of two Ordinances (Planning Code Text Amendment and Zoning Map Amendment) that would rezone parcels in the Upper Market NCD (Upper Market Neighborhood Commercial District) to the Upper Market NCT (Upper Market Neighborhood Commercial Transit District).
Planning Code Text Amendment.  This proposed Ordinance [Board File No. 12-0901], introduced by Supervisor Wiener, would amend the Planning Code, amending Sections 721.1 and 733.1 to modify the explanation of boundaries of the Upper Market Street Neighborhood Commercial District (NCD) and the Upper Market Street Neighborhood Commercial Transit District (NCT), and amending Section 703.2(b) to permit, in a limited area, food processing as an accessory use to a nearby off-site non-residential use; and would adopt findings, including environmental findings, Planning Code Section 302 findings, and findings of consistency with the General Plan and the priority policies of Planning Code Section 101.
Zoning Map Amendment.This proposed Ordinance [Board File 12-0902], introduced by Supervisor Wiener, would amend the Planning Code Sectional Map Sheets ZN07 and HT07 to change the use classification of specified lots on Blocks 3561 through 3565, now in the Upper Market NCD (Upper Market Neighborhood Commercial District) to the Upper Market NCT (Upper Market Neighborhood Commercial Transit District) and to change the height and bulk classification of Block 3563, Lot 034 from 50-X to 65-B.  The proposed amendment would rezone most of the Upper Market NCD to Upper Market NCT land use controls.  Two lots near the northwest corner of Market and Castro Streets would remain in the Upper Market NCD district.  The proposed amendment would also change the Height and Bulk designation on one lot at the southwest corner of Market and Noe Streets from 50-X to 65-B.  The Planning Department may propose additional rezoning of the remaining Upper Market NCD parcels at the northwest corner of Market and Castro Streets from the Upper Market NCD to the Upper Market NCT zoning.

·Future Meetings/Agendas.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Antonini:
Three things briefly, in regards to the Subcommittee for the secretary search, we have heard from the Department of Human Resources in regards to the classification, and we are scheduling a meeting of the Subcommittee in the near future to try to go over this item and see if we're going to be able to move forward at this time.
Commissioner Borden:
I'm sorry. That is out of order. We're filing an appeal. Do you have an update on that?
Commissioner Antonini:
I don't have an update -- not on the appeal. I am reporting that I am in receipt of something that came from them, I am not speaking about what our actions are going to be, just reporting on what I've received. So, we will deal with that -- in Subcommittee we'll discuss the other items, but I just wanted to make the public aware that we are in process of working on this, because this is not a calendared item, of course. Number two, a couple of articles in yesterday's Chronicle dealing with land use regarding the proposed arena on Piers 30 and 32, written by John King, the Architectural Editor. I thought it was a well written article, but I can assure at least from my point of view Mr. King expresses some concerns about the environmental review and its speed. I can say that expedient and complete and thorough are not mutually exclusive, and you can do something and certainly I would expect the same analysis to be every bit as thorough. This would be the case with any EIR, but that does not preclude it from moving in an expedient manner if it can be done. The other very interesting article by John Wildermuth, very excellent journal on the housing wars, Key to City's Diversity, that's the title of it. He does talk a little bit on the years of protest. It's well written, but a little self-laudatory in that we have a lot of problems, still a City which once had a huge middle class and had lots of families with children and had some of the highest sale prices of anyplace. We have to differentiate. He mentioned we have done a lot of good things, stopping freeways from chopping up the city, stopping another Western Addition destruction as happened in the '60s, but there also is a price that sometimes -- some of these things have perhaps been carried to extremes and they have added into higher prices and more process, and some of the woes we have today. So, there's always a happy medium. But I thought it was an interesting article and I would urge you to take a look at it if you haven't already.Commissioner Moore:
We had an item on our consent calendar which raises an issue which I could not discuss in the context of consent, but which raises for me an issue I would like the Department to focus on. I am talking about the 2815 Diamond Street, an ATM. I personally believe that ATMs are starting to become more billboards and oversized signs, advertising for the bank , rather than saying there is a convenience machine with a logo which identifies what you're supposed to do. This has been going on now for quite a few months, actually for way over a year. I raised that question months before when I saw the significant changes on the California/Montgomery Streets side for the Bank of America, where two or three or four ATMs look like a huge billboards rather than what they're supposed to be. I question that and I would like the Department to find a small slot to investigate as to whether or not we need to amend or what these particular ATM’s are, can or should be. It speaks to alteration and architecture and it speaks to advertising, which I think we normally look at under different rules, that's problem number one. On the positive side, I just came back from Venice, Italy where I had the good fortune to attend the 13th Architecture Biennale, Common Ground, which is an international event which occurs every two years and obviously one of the most spectacular cities in the world. What I want to talk about is not the travel experience, but what the United States did in response to the general heading of the titled themeCommon Ground. In the past the exhibits deal with architecture and focuses on the different countries. Obviously the U.S. has provided great contributions and high-rise buildings and that was for many years a reoccurring theme by which we really showed the promise of this country in developing high-rise buildings and pushing the design and the structural solutions pretty much to the extreme of world architecture. This time, though, and I am extremely happy about that we really participated in the discussion about common ground, and skipping fast forward to the U.S. Pavilion, we chose the response to being spontaneous interventions which focused on citizen and individual-driven innovations and improving the urban environment.  San Francisco was featured very prominently, with urban parklets and urban gardens. Many of the projects were identified by name and our own, our very own David Winslow was featured when he was participating as a private architect with Linden Alley. This is just one of many, it was beautifully put together, the design by a Sausalito firm and I was really proud. I hope that somewhere on the web all of you will take a moment to see how good we looked.
Commissioner Sugaya:
Another piece from the Chronicle, it's actually the Sunday datebook and it's in their way back column. This goes back to 1987, November 20th. I'll just read it. It is pertinent to the planning process. It says "November 20th, CharlotteMeyers,Wailliardhas lost the fight to prevent her neighbor from blocking her view of Golden Gate Bridge. San Francisco Board of Appeals by a 5 to 0 vote reversed a Planning Commission vote against the fourth floor rooftop addition by David and Andrea Rossen.  Robert Feldman, Director of the Board said, there's no way to build anything in San Francisco without blocking views, and the Board reiterated last night its often stated position that neither California courts nor the statutes protect views.
10.        Director’s Announcements
Jeff Joslin,
No announcements that I'm aware of today that I've received from the Director, who is currently out of town representing the Department elsewhere.

One, milestone achievements, that being recognition of staff that have been here for a long, dedicated career, at least for five years. David Alumgaugh 15 years, Lulu Hwang remarkable 30 years.
