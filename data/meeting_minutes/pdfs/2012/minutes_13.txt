BEACH CHALET ATHLETIC FIELDS RENOVATION- Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report.The San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department is proposing to renovate the Beach Chalet Athletic Fields facility, an approximately 9.4-acre public sports field facility located at 1500 John F. Kennedy Drive, along the western edge of Golden Gate Park. The Athletic Fields currently include four grass turf athletic fields surrounded by an 8-foot-tall metal chain link fence, an approximately 25,320âsquare-foot, 50âspace asphalt parking lot (including one disabled-accessible space), a restroom building, and a cargo container being used as a maintenance shed. The project would include replacing the existing grass turf fields with synthetic turf, installing field lighting, renovating the existing restroom building, installing player benches and seating, and completing other modifications for parking, circulation, and spectator amenities to improve the overall conditions of the facility and increase the amount of play time available on the athletic fields. With project implementation, the project site would remain in its current use as an athletic field complex within an urban park. The project site is located in a Public Use District, a Coastal Special Use District, and an Open Space Height and Bulk District.
NOTE: The public hearing on the Draft EIR is closed. The public comment period for the Draft EIR ended on December 12, 2011.
