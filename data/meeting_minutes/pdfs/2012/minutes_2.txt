C.COMMISSIONERS’ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
6.        
        Commission Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements. 
        Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or
        inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas. 
        At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a
        Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda
        of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Antonini:
I would like to thanks
        the San Francisco Forty-niners for a great season, regrettably, with a sad
        ending. I was thanking the 49ers., with particular reference to that defense,
        not to the exclusion of the entire team, but for one of the greatest seasons the
        defense has had in the history of the NFL.  That should remind us, as San
        Franciscans we always have to be tenacious in the defense of our traditions,
        institutions, and civic treasures and always be tirelessly a good advocate and
        representative of our City.
Commissioner Borden:
This week, I met with J.
        Mathews.  While I was meeting with him on a second item, we were talking about
        some of the things going on with planning.  He had spoken with Commissioner
        Moore previously but was wondering how they can work more closely with the
        Department on the innovative initiatives with greater transparency and more
        innovation. They are very interested in learning about the permit tracking
        system we're going to look at next week and maybe we can invite him to join us
        for that so we can know more what he is doing in that space. We' e looking at
        how to create innovations within existing departments to make it easier for the
        public to go through a very serious city process these and to figure out how to
        better work with his office because he is one guy trying to figure out all the
        different city agencies. If there is a way we can work with him, because we
        interface with the public so much more frequently that would be useful. He was
        eager to hear we were hiring a communication person and I would like to look at
        how that would apply to other departments as well.
Commissioner Moore:
I would very much support
        what you just said. He is a terrific guy and we would have a very good ally in
        things that we are interested in being involved in including new technology and
        communication. I want to bring to the Commission's attention an article I saw in
        the paper which is only hinting at San Francisco begins issuing medical
        marijuana dispenser permits again. I would like our staff to at some point to
        [get] less than a short-term brief of how they see it from their perspective
        regarding the newspaper article. It seems to be pointing into the direction of
        what the City policy is. I found the article quite interesting. I would be happy
        to pass it around.
President Miguel:
I recently met with people
        from San Francisco MOMA and it was very interesting. I have been talking to
        people at North Beach regarding grocery stores and have met with the people at
        the Metro Theater which may finally come to pass. It seems a distant memory when
        that was before us. I was also at a public meeting regarding the Waterfront the
        other day on the playground proposed. They have done an excellent job with it
        and there is great enthusiasm, particularly from a lot of little kids who
        recognize all of the play equipment and really like it. Yesterday, one of the
        noontime forums regarding retail and fresh food and trying to get more of it
        into various areas of San Francisco was a very interesting forum.

        Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
I just wanted to give you
        a brief review of my talk in Seattle the last couple of days.  I was there at
        the request of an organization that had been called The Cascade of Land
        Conservancy and has recently changed their name. I am not quite sure why the
        change except they are expanding their purview and they were more a traditional
        land conservancy agency and they have expanded their mission in recent years. 
        With a basic understanding that's in order for them to take care of the land
        outside the urban areas and control urban sprawl, they need to spend more time
        and attention on what happens to make those more livable and all walkable. It is
        interesting to see that perspective. What happens outside cities is related to
        what happens inside cities and that is interesting. They started a rural to
        urban transit development program where the development rights are sold and
        transferred to the center City of Seattle. It is pretty interesting. It is
        something we had done 15 years ago in Seattle and it is very interesting. I also
        want to report that the City received a very interesting award this past week.
        It is an international award from the Institute for Transportation Development
        Policy granted to the City. It is an interesting program they have put together.
        Our program is to take over underutilized rights of way. They mentioned those
        programs and gave us a strong acclaim for the work we're doing.  They also made
        a strong point of mentioning the City's Bicycle Plan and network related to
        those programs, but this is a substantial reward we are to receive.
        Congratulations to the staff and the department for all of the work on those
        things.
