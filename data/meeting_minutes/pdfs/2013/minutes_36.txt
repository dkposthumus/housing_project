Commissioner Antonini:
We are all very encouraged, I think, by things that we have seen in the press, regarding the building boom, commercial and residential, unfortunately, we still see many individuals in our streets and parks who are incapacitated, and often need to be cared for, on an ongoing basis by our health officials, and there seem to be a revolving door of this care.  In regard to this, I received a phone call from a firefighter, a friend of mine and who introduced me to CaptainNiels Tangherliniand he has produced what I think it is an outstanding document, and is part of the public record for today. He proposes a plan of dealing with this situation, and I will be asking for the Commission to schedule a hearing to discuss, perhaps to get the Captain and others who are involved in the formulation of this document to discuss it. It proposes a solution to this problem with paramedics and other individuals from the Fire Department playing a large role in the triage system and I think it is outstanding. I think it will take a while for the public to read it and for Commissioners.  We do not need to make a decision about scheduling it today, but I will bring it up in the following weeks. I think it is a very important issue, and has been with us for decades.  I think there is a solution that is out there, I call your attention to the document in the public record and it is titled: San Francisco Plan for Dealing with Chronic Homelessness.

6.         Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
LAND USE COMMITTEE: None
FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
INTRODUCTIONS:
BOARD OF APPEALS:
There are two items that I think might be of interest to the Commission today.  1) 2065 Oakdale Avenue is building permit application, the old Berkeley Farm property.  There was no notice required under the Planning Code or the Building Code because is an alteration permit.  Neighbors had concerned about the removal of the building, or a portion of the building. Appears that the building contractor did not operate or making the property in best fashion, so, there were concerns about the noise from working on the property. The property is an PDR 1B zoning district, so there is no notification.  The Board upheld the permit. 2) Appeal of Letter of Termination for 800 Brotherhood Way, this is the project that the Commission heard in 2005, it had a condition of approval, the decision is now voided, is there is lapse of three years or more in the authorization, they have several years of lawsuits since 2007, they have been working on getting the appropriate permits they have tentative map approval from DPW, they also submitted building permit to the Planning Department. So, the letter of termination found they were in compliance with that condition they have not lapsed on their authorization.  There was an appeal from neighbors concerned about the project.   They was not appeal of the CU and was approved by the Planning Commission in 2005, but there was an appeal of the environmental decision and also a lawsuit on the environmental decision.
HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:
New Mission Theater – modifications were approved
Duboce Landmark District resolution was adopted by the HPC which will be on your calendar next Thursday.
Also, it marked the last hearing for Commissioner/President Chase, who will no longer be sitting on the HPC and during this interim period Commissioner Dan Kroger has moved into the role of  President of the HPC.
