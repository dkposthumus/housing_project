Commissioner Antonini:
Just reporting that: the Secretary Search Subcommittee joint meeting between the Planning Commission and Historic Preservation Commission continues to meet. We met yesterday and we will be meeting again in three weeks and we'll keep you apprised of the progress in this venture.
Commissioner Sugaya:
In the Business Times there's an article, lengthy articles on housing in the City and something like 8,000 units are under construction, at this point or about to be, but there was a smaller article accompanying the main one that noted that I think somewhere around 10 percent or less are actually able to be converted to condominiums. According to the article, it had to do with the financing that developers have taken on or the nature of their business or whatever, but they used a figure of 10 percent, so the majority appear to be apartments for I don't know, forever, but for a good long time.
5.         Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:

·BF 121019 & 130248 Supervisor Wiener & Kim’s CEQA Procedures Ordinance.Both items were called together again at the Committee on Monday.This was the first hearing where Supervisor Kim’s proposal was potentially “actionable”  as you heard last week  Supervisor Kim’s Ordinance was heard last Wednesday by the HPC yesterday and that Commission passed a resolution that was the same as your recommendation (approval of some portions, disapproval of other portions and to explore four additional questions[1]) with the following additions:
1.Planning to provide an analysis that clarifies the differences between Supervisor Kim and Supervisor Wiener’s Legislation regarding when an exemption appeal period ends, i.e. the difference between first approval and last approval.
2.The Legislation should allow entitlements, including Landmark designation, be allowed to move forward while the appeal is pending.
3.The Legislation should clarify the role of the HPC in the appeals process.
This week the Clerk of the board requested minor amendments and three members of the public spoke.  The Planning Department also presented the memorandum which I’m providing to you now.  This memo responds to the four additional questions that this Commission asked with regards to Supervisor Kim’s proposal. This memo describes our current and planned notification capacities; approvals while an appeal is pending and potential avenues for prioritizing affordable housing and other priority projects.Board President Chiu restated his commitment to bring potential amendments forward to Supervisor Wiener’s proposal. Both items were continued to the call of the Chair.
