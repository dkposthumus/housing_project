Commissioner Antonini:
A couple of things, first of all, my congratulations to Team Oracle, America’s teams for its amazing comeback, I don’t know, when you look through the annals of supports, perhaps the Red Socks coming back to defeat the Yankees in the American League finals, I think it was 2006, finally beating the curse of the Bambinos,a big win, and the Giants come back a year ago, they had to stave off, I think, 5 elimination games, if I counted right, maybe 6, to advance to the World Series. But, this is even a bigger margin to overcome. I think it was spectacular for San Francisco. I'm hoping they can return in the future with the things that need to be done, to make even better and the Bay of San Francisco could become the Augusta of boat racing, even though, unlike the Masters it doesn't happen every year. Certainly we have a site that’s spectacular, one that could attract other regattas to that site, so, hopefully that will be what will happen. And secondly, I just have a question. I've received some correspondence on some of the preliminary ideas been proposed by the Supervisors on theformula retail legislation and I wonder if we are we going to get an update or we are going to wait until they comeit little closer to actually having some concrete proposals.
Director Rahaim:
Commissioners, a couple of them have been in front of you.There are others that are in the works. We'll be bringing those to you, for your comment as they come forward, I think what will do, what you are suggestion reminds me, when we do bring those forward, we should remind youabout the whole range of proposals that are on the table just to put in some kind of context.
Commissioner Antonini:
This particular e-mail, I forget its source, it basically listed the entire package of things.I understand - I know that the different supervisors have different things they are interested in, but the whole thought was for them to come up with some sort of a comprehensive package that we could pass judgment on as a whole, rather than individual.
Director Rahaim:
What you asked them to do as a Commission, is to hold off until we complete our economic analysis, which we are just hiring the consultant to do, and that analysiswill probably take about three months at this point. So we are hoping they will hold off some of them, feel like they need to move forward with their particular proposals at this point. We are hoping that before any of those provisions are adopted we could do it with the knowledge of the study that we are conducting right now.
Commissioner Moore:
I want to add my voice to the congratulations, but extend my congratulations to all City Departments who made it happen. I think the behind scenes work, that was done by a large number of people, not only in the Planning, but in the execution of the changed venue were phenomenal and that's where my congratulations are. Oh, if I may. I read something in the paper yesterday, late at night and early this morning, which was very disturbing.That is an Ellis Act eviction in my former neighborhood on Jackson and Larkin, and I am concerned that this is a huge area, twenty or more square blocks, where all the buildings have the same qualities as the buildings from which this particular family’s being evicted, together with the same profile of people, residents who are living there. I see people, over the last thirty years, as I’ve lived in this neighborhood, aging in place. They were young professional that move into their middle ages, and they all stay, because one it is a very good neighborhood with quick accessibility to downtown and the needs of a neighborhood, from schools to churches to grocery stores, etc., and I think there is a change that is occurring, which I hope people find tools to monitor and turn around because we cannot see a large increase on evictions without changing the City, in its very essence.
Commissioner Antonini:
I noticed the same article, the press was quite fair by pointing out these types of things are legal under State law and there is a consideration that those who are evicted that have to be given.My concern is, it would seem like we're building a lot of newaffordable housing and are non-profits, of which we put a lot of City funding into, in terms of hundreds millions of dollars, you know, provide housing it would seem like people who are in this situation, where there are being evicted,longtime resident should come to the top of the list and should be provided housing by these groups and others or new housing that’s being built as part of our non-profit, I am not sure if there is a priority given, but that is something I'd be interested in knowing about
9.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
One announcement of an interest, a community event we're sponsoring on October 9th. The Commission knows we've received a grant to do an African-American Context Statement for the City, to look at African-American History and its impact on the built environment. We're having a kickoff community event that we're sponsoring in conjunction with the San Francisco African-American Historical Cultural Society and the African American Art and Culture Complex. This is a community meeting that will happen on Wednesday, October 9thfrom 6:00 to 8:00 p.m., at the African-American Art and Culture Complex which is at 762 Fulton Street.Again, October 9thfrom 6:00 to 8:00 p.m., to kick off the African-American Context Statement that we will be doing in the next several months, with that I don't have any other announcements. AnMarie Rodgers, tells me that no Planning related events happened at the Board this week and the one CEQA appeal that was on the calendar was continued.
