C.COMMISSION MATTERS
5.Commission Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements.Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Antonini:
A couple of things, first of all,I just want to report that the Commission Subcommittees from Historic Preservation and Planning met yesterday on the Secretary Search issue and we will be meeting again in a couple of weeks and we continue to progress on that particular issue. Also wanted to comment on the unfortunate vote that occurred on Tuesday, in my opinion, on the condo conversion legislation regarding the lottery. We never had a chance to weigh in on this and I am going to give my opinion now. I certainly will hope for a second reading I will urge the supervisors who voted for it to vote against it and if gets to that point, the Mayor should veto it if it is passed. My reasons are as follows: the original legislation by Supervisor Farrell was extremely focused and dealt with a distinct group of people who are already owners and occupiers, it is not about future entries into TIC’s, it is not about renters, it is about peoplewho were trapped in a situation where up to 10 years or longer they had to be co-owners with others. People lose jobs, people get transferred things happened, it’s very burdensome, financing is difficult. It was just a method to move people into separate ownership, which is basically a housekeeping matter and my issue, it's been completely distorted and it would do a lot of very negative things particularly eliminate the possibility of TIC conversations for five or six units building. There are a lot of very nice apartments, that are five to six units, they have 1,500 to 2,000 sq. ft., exactly an opportunity for families with children that cannot afford a single-family home, but might be able to, working with others, purchase a building like this and occupy it indefinitely and they would be out of luck, via the TIC method. Also, further restrictions on occupancy, which are already very strict, I know of cases where people were “caught” in a unit and unable to move into a larger unit within the same building because of the requirements for occupancy, and then a ten year moratorium on it. So those are a lot of the, any future TIC conversions to condos, so it doesn’t speak, the present legislation doesn’t speak to the original problem and Farrell’s legislation was much more focused and advantageous; again it has gone way beyond.And also for those of us I happened to live in the west side of San Francisco, and many homeowners and I've had a lot of calls from people and there has been some reports of people in my area don't care about this, they do care very much about this and very much would be a favor of what Sup. Farrell had originally proposed and oppose the present version. So that's not accurate as far as I can tell. Thank you very much.
Commissioner Sugaya:
For members of the public and for people watching this on SFGTV, Commissioner Antonini’s comments are his own, and do not reflect anything that has to do with this Commission.
6.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
The only announcement I wanted to make was related to the meeting last time on the Central Corridor Plan.It was a meeting to go over a list of potential topics that we would be studying with the community over the next year. We had a very good turnout of, I think, 70 or 80 people. Reviewed a list of potential topics, came up with a very long potential list and we are scheduled to report to you next week briefly on what our kind of proposed list of topics will be for having a series of meeting over the next year, so I just wanted to report to you on that, and thank staff and thank the public for coming out and listening.
7.Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
LAND USE COMMITTEE:
Supervisor Wiener’s Planning Code amendment for Mobile foodordinance[1]was at LU.In addition to the Planning Code amendment, the Land Use Committee also considered two related pieces of legislation that regulate Food Trucks, Board File 120193 (Public Works Code that details locational and noticing requirements for Food Trucks), and Board File 121108 (Transportation Code related to permitting and licensing by DPW).The DPW Code amendments address the location of food trucks on the public right of way in relation to schools, as well as food trucks associated with restaurants considered formula retail.
Planning Code Amendment (BF 12-0125)
On April 19, 2012, the Planning Commission considered the PC ordinance.This limited ordinance would amend Section 205.4 to allow intermittent temporary uses, including Mobile Food Facilities, within RH, RM, RED, and RTO Zoning Districts on parcels that contain medical institutions or post-secondary institutions.   Food trucks that operate in these locations may not operate between the hours of 10pm and 7am.
At the hearing, the Commission voted 6-0 to recommend approval with modifications of the proposed Ordinance.  The Commission’s recommended modifications were intended to clarify that 312 notification would be required for food trucks located within 50’ of a parcel on which there is a residential use, or for food trucks that exceed 300 square feet in size.  The supervisor responded to the Commission’s request and broadened it slightly by requiring that notice not only occur within 50’ of a dwelling unit but also within 50’ of any parcel zoned RH, RM, RED, and RTO, AND the notice would also apply to any food trucks that exceed 300’ in size.
DPW Amendments (BF-120193)
·Location Restrictions:
oNo food trucks within 500’ of any public elementary or middle school;
oNo food trucks within 1,000’ of any public high school between the hours of 7am and 5pm (M-F) .[1]
oNo food trucks located within 75’ of an existing restaurant.
oFood trucks may only operate at one location three days/week.
·Mobile Food Facilities and Formula Retail:
oFood trucks operated by a formula retail restaurant, it may not be located within the public right-of-way in a district in which formula retail is NP or requires a CU.
oNote that for this restriction, the formula retail definition includes “affiliates” of formula retail restaurants, which includes an entity that is owned by or has a financial or contractual agreement with a formula retail use.
With these amendments, all three ordinances were recommended for approval.
FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
·Supervisor Weiner 3 ped safety legislation (APPROVED 1STREADING)
1.Create an interagency Street Design Review Committee made up of Planning, SFMTA, DPW, SFPUC, OEWD, and Fire Department to review street improvement projects against established City policies, such as the Transit-First Policy and the Better Streets Plan
2.Create a Public Improvement Permit(for instance for in-kind infrastructure) that would enable the DPW Director to administratively accept public improvements built by third-party developers in the right-of-way, if accompanied by a maintenance endowment (bypasses the need for major encroachment permit and gift acceptance by Board of Supervisors).
3.Change to Fire Code to clarify that unobstructed curb extensions (things like a bulbout without trees or poles) would not count against the 20 foot minimum clear width required by the Fire Code
·Condo-conversion Fee.Amended and approved on first reading.This one was not heard by this commission. I have a press release from Supervisor Chiu summarizing the actions this week as well as a list of the amendments on Tuesday.
FINAL READING
·130180 Pre-Application Meetings Required in PDR-1B.PC approved on May 9. Board approved on FINAL reading this week.
·111278 Art & Design SUD 1111 8thStreet.This ordinance would create an SUD to allow educational institutions without use size limits; to permit student housing; and to allow the ZA to authorize temporary structures without a public hearing for property currently occupied by the California College of Arts.This ordinance was recommended for approval by this Commission on April 25.Board approved on FINAL reading.
INTRODUCTIONS:
·130631 City's Plan to Ensure Transit Service Keeps Pace with Current and Future Development.Supe. Wiener.Hearing directed to the Mayor’s Office, Planning Department, Municipal Transportation Agency (MTA), Transportation Authority, Office of Economic and Workforce Development, the Office of the Controller, and the Port of San Francisco to report on how the City is planning to expand Muni’s service capacity, including how that expansion will be paid for on an on-going basis, in light of significant planned development, population growth, and job growth, as well as Muni’s current lack of sufficient, reliable service capacity; the departments will be asked to discuss how they evaluate the need for additional transit service, what increase in service levels are needed, how the increase will occur, and how it will be paid for on an ongoing basis to accommodate growth projections associated with planned and future development projects and population and job increases; the departments also will analyze whether MTA’s baselines budget should be increased in light of development and population trends.
