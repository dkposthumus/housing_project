4.         Commission Comments/Questions
Inquiries/Announcements.  Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
Future Meetings/Agendas.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Olague:
The issue of parking has come up and I would like this added to the Action List.  I think it is a very complicated subject.  I know we try to encourage people to come here to shop attend the arts venues, go to restaurants, etc., but there is also the cost of the parking.  Iâm thinking about the mid-Market area.  We see a lot of development being proposed for that area.  Would like a comprehensive status of projects being proposed that includes a parking analysis and what is going in mid-Market (the Mint, Yerba Buena, the mid-Market Redevelopment area).  I want a comprehensive view of what is going on along Market Street.
Commissioner Antonini:
I have no opposition to that.  However, when you look at projects, each has distinct characteristics where parking and other services as part of the project are more critical to some projects than to other projects.  I think that while you can look at something comprehensively in terms of this issue, I think you have to look at the type of service you have.  So you do have to be specific to the project in some instances.
5.         Directorâs Announcements
Director Rahaim:
I attended the District 11 community meeting last Saturday morning on DR Reform.  It was a lively discussion.  Supervisor Avalos attended that meeting as well.
6.         Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS
Land Use Committeeâthe Committee heard an ordinance that concerns a 5 foot height bonus for active ground floor uses and eliminates area in District 11.  This Commission recommended approval of that item on 11/12 with two modifications:  1) would apply the bonus to all NC-1 zoned parcels in the area; and 2) the bonus to apply to ground floor uses that are commercial only.  This week, Supervisor Avalos amended the ordinance to include your modifications and the Committee recommended approval to the full Board.
Full BoardâThe Board heard the Tobacco Paraphernalia Establishments legislation.  You heard this legislation on two different hearings.  At the final hearing on 11/12 you recommended approval with a new definition as to how we would measure these tobacco paraphernalia establishments, projecting the 10 or more liner feet down to the floor level.  At that time you also cautioned the Board that this ordinance would be difficult for the Department to enforce.  This week the Board did pass the ordinance on its final reading with your amendments.
Also, the Board heard a Zoning Map amendment for the Bayview Hunterâs Point Area Plan.You considered this item on September 24thand unanimously recommended approval.  The item would update the zoning for the area from M-1 and M-2 to the new PDR districts.  At the Committee hearing they did amend two parcels near Phelps and Williams Avenues from PDR buffer zoning to PDR-2 zoning district.  With amendment, this item was passed by the full Board this week.
The Board also heard an ordinance pertaining to the Mills Act Contracts.This item was heard by the Historic Preservation Commission.  The ordinance would amend chapter 71 of the Administration Code to expand the definition of a qualified historical property to include those listed on the California Register of Historic Resources.  When the HPC heard it on November 4ththey recommended approval with four modifications including extending the number of days the Controller and our Department would have to review applications and including both contributor and individual buildings in the State Registry as part of this definition.  This week the full Board passed the ordinance on its final reading with those amendments incorporated into the final ordinance.
There was also an appeal of a Categorical Exemption for 2750 Vallejo Street.Commission you heard a DR on a related project on August 31st.  You did not take DR and approved the project.  The project proposed faÃ§ade alterations and rear and side addition to a three-story, single-family home.  At this weekâs CEQA appeal, one of the appellantâs primary arguments was that the building should have been considered as an individually significant resource.  While the Department did not consider the building as individually significant, we did treat the structure as a historic resource under CEQA as a contributor to a potential historic district.  The Board upheld the CatEx by a vote of 6 to 5.
Introductions âBoard President Chiu introduced a resolution urging the California Legislator to amend the Costa Hawkins Act to exempt local inclusionary housing ordinances.  Mayor Newsom and Supervisors Carmen Chu and Bevin Dufty introduced a green landscaping ordinance that would amend the Planning Code to address greening street tree and permit ability requirements.  The Mayor introduced some revised ordinances having to do with his earlier fee deferral ordinances which you will be considering in a January hearing.
BOARD OF APPEALS:
350 & 430CaliforniaStreetâ Signs were installed on the top of the buildings that were contrary to the Planning Code.  Those permits were signed off by the Planning Department in error.  The Zoning Administrator revoked those permits.  Ultimately we could not come to an agreement on a time when they would remove those signs and the Board imposed eight years â an amortization period â for them to remove those signs.
2516-2524 Mission Streetâ An appeal of the Zoning Administrator stating that the roof deck was inappropriate and not approved by the Planning Commission appropriately.  The Board agreed with that.  The appellant has a conditional use on file.  They didnât agree with that.  They continued it two months to allow the project sponsor to pursue a conditional use before this Planning Commission.
395 Atlas StreetâYou heard this as a DR where the DR applicant did not show up.  It essentially stated that the light well that was being provided was not adequate.  The appellant who is the DR applicant originally owned this property and sold it to the project sponsor and asserts that the project should provide a larger light well but also noted that prior to the light well having been installed in the proposal, the project sponsor had offered him $10,000 to put skylights in.  He was amenable to have the skylights put in that the Commission approved and the $10,000.  The Board fond that the project complied with the Residential Design Guidelines and voted 5 to 0 to uphold the permit.
Historic Preservation Commission:
Hotdog Stands in the Music Concourse of Golden Gate Parkâ a couple of members of the public spoke on this under Public Comment.  The HPC has instructed that this item be scheduled for public hearing in January.
Mills Act Contract for 178 Townsend âtheCommission approved this 6 to 1 with Commissioner Wolfram voting against.
890Grove Streetcofa âthe Commission approved with modifications adding a finding of no adverse impact to the district; that the siding be flush; and that the height be reduced by 6â (six inches).
Candlestick Pointdeir âthe Commission was not entirely pleased with the document as currently proposed; they expressed specific concerns and voted to have Commissioner Jim Buckley come to this hearing and express those concerns to you today when that item is heard.

H.PUBLIC COMMENT
At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public comment, the commission is limited to:
(1)  responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or
(2)  requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or
(3)directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.  (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))
