2.Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Moore:
At a quarter to one an amazing email came in from the Mayor's Office announcing that the city was awarded $96 million dollars in housing and infrastructure funds by the California Department of Housing and Community Development.It will affect a large number of projects we've deliberated from Hunters View to 333 Harrison, to 5800 Third, 2235 Third, 178 Townsend, the Tenderloin YMCA, and 1000 Fourth Street.The money at this moment, as we all know, isn't quite there, and I don't think the city gets construction going based on IOU, but this money is apparently earmarked for the city and I think it's going to be a phenomenal jump start for everybody; for us having delivered the work, but also for the construction industry, for labor, and for everybody.I am absolutely thrilled to hear that.On another note, last weekend from the Farmers market, I went upstairs in the Ferry Building and I saw a phenomenal exhibit and I would like to bring it to the attention to the Commission.It's going to be here through the weekend.Rising Tides is a competition sponsored by BCDC to look at possible solutions of how San Francisco and other waterfront related cities in the bay region will deal with the proverbial rising sea levels.John King wrote about it I think today or yesterday, announcing the winners of that competition.There were 150 entries from 18 countries.It was a thrill to see that and if you haven' seen it, please go and do so and you can also go to Farmers Market and shop while you are there.On a slightly more somber note, I'm having a number of people call me and wanting to get my thoughts on CPMC and the Van Ness Street Campus.There are many many questions I cannot answer; many questions I have thought about for a long time – more than just that I am on the Planning Commission – and I'd like to ask President Miguel and the Commission to support me in asking that we schedule a joint session with the Health Commission.Jim Illic is their President.They are indeed in charge for policy and general issues regarding health care in San Francisco.This goes beyond just talking about the design of the hospital; it's a much farther reaching issue.I'd like that we do that soon so that when this project is in front of us we are informed to the best of everybody's knowledge.I know the public is very interested to participate in that discussion.Do I get the support from this commission?
Commissioner Miguel:
You very definitely do.It so happens that your comments are very timely.They came just before mine because I had the pleasure of having a very long lunch with Jim Illic at his request because he is also asking for a joint meeting.I think that would be excellent.I would like when that is scheduled, as soon as it could be conveniently scheduled, that one of the people I would like present will be Catherine Dodd on the Mayor's staff who is intimately knowledgeable about everything in health care in this city and very aware of everything from the building to the politics to the nurses.If we could get that on the books, that would be excellent.
Director Rahaim responded:
Commissioners, just so you know, I am meeting with Catherine and Mitch Katz next week to talk about CPMC and some of these issues that have been coming up.
Commissioner Miguel:
It's more than just Cathedral Hill; it includes the other sites as well.
Commissioner Lee:
Yesterday, the San Francisco Business Times had a meeting where we had guest speakers and Oz Erikson made a comment about the units costing each developer $80,000 per unit downtown.John you were there yesterday and I was wondering if you could formally ask Oz Erikson how he got the data that it cost that much money of city fees and taxes to build one unit downtown.
Director Rahaim responded:
I would be happy to do that.My understanding of his comments were that he was talking about the total impact fees including affordable housing, and that the number was from Rincon Hill.It wasn't for all of downtown; it was for the Rincon Hill Plan.It was from the first project of Rincon Hill.
Commissioner Lee:
I think it is important to see because it's out there being said to all the developers that no matter how much [] because of the down turn economy, that if you buy a condo at $600,000; $80,000 goes to the city.He made a recommendation to the Mayor and the Board of Supervisors that we should waive all this for the next couple of years.Then apparently some labor people feel the same way so that we can create jobs downtown.Given that we have 25% unemployment in the trades right now, I can see things coming to a head regarding the fees that the city has instituted.But I need clarity.I don't have the data.He just made this bold statement.
Commissioner Olague:
I was there and I guess it just depends on who's listening and how people hear what's being said.I actually found some of the comments that I heard somewhat alarming because I had the sense that there was a pitting of labor against affordable housing advocates.I think the city needs both and in a down turn in the economy we should all be working together – labor and affordable housing and developers and everybody should look for a situation where we all can win instead of &I just found it very one sided.I would rather see us have a discussion maybe with the Mayor's Office of Economic and Workforce Development and affordable housing developers and the development community about fees and fee structures instead of just reacting or responding to the comments of one person at a Business Times breakfast.And you always have to consider your audience.I'm sure if I went to a breakfast of affordable housing developers the pitch might be very different.I agree that San Francisco needs to work also, but I think that when we start to make statements let's say at the expense of affordable housing, then we get into some dangerous areas.Right now I just went to talk to some tenants who are being evicted because their rent got raised by $1,300 a month and $800 a month because they don't live in rent controlled units.So I think that when we are talking about an economy where a lot of people who are earning six figures a year are facing long periods of unemployment we can't just dismiss the discussion on the importance of continuing to invest in affordable housing development.I think it needs to be a more robust conversation that involves the Mayor's Office of Economic and Workforce Development, possibly the Supervisors and others; that it can't just be based on a knee jerk reaction by one comment made at one breakfast of the Business Times.
Commissioner Antonini:
I would agree with the previous speakers in that many jurisdictions are looking at this whole fee situation and they are waiving fees for a while or looking at ways that they can encourage building to go forward and I think that is certainly instructive.I don't know that it is necessarily an adversarial situation.I think that the more we learn about what other areas are doing and what can be done to help support labor, business, and affordable housing – I mean all those things can be done if something gets built.If nothing gets built, nothing happens and we don't get any benefits.I think that it certainly would be good to have some sort of hearing and bring in people who are knowledgeable on the subject so we can at least make decisions and we may be able to advise the Board of Supervisors and others as to what ways things might help to remedy the current situation where possible.
Commissioner Borden:
I had the good fortune yesterday of going on a tour with the Women's Initiative for Self Employment.They are an organization based here and throughout the Bay Area that trains low income women to become entrepreneurs.It was really an amazing experience to walk around the Mission and see these businesses that had been founded by these women who used to be on public assistance but now have thriving and flourishing businesses in that community.It just reminded me of our conversation we were going to have with the Small Business Commission and looking at economic development and storefronts and neighborhood commercial corridors because there are some amazing businesses.The statistics coming out of Women's Initiative, which has been around for twenty years, is actually pretty incredible.Within 18 months the women who come out of that program who start off usually negative as far as their assets, end up doubling their income.They make $18,000 more than they made the year before just from one year after the program and after that they double their income in such a short period of time.It's just such an amazing program and we always talk about economic development and we are looking at land use decisions and how we can support the flourishing of these sorts of businesses and support programs like this that really focus on micro finance.A lot of these women got money from the city through programs that allowed them to have their first months rent paid for.I know that fund has gone away because of the economic downturn, but we need to talk about that and figure out how we can help support that and maybe also work with some landlords to be able to help offer reduced rents for the first months or things like that.
Commissioner Antonini:
We are also in receipt of a correspondence from Mitch Katz.It's a health analysis of California Pacific Medical Center Institutional Master Plan.I don't know it that is calendared for discussion in the future; if it's just instructive; or how it fits into what we were discussing earlier?
Director Rahaim responded:
Commissioner, it is calendared tentatively on September 17.That report will be part of the presentation on the Institutional Master Plan.
3.Director's Announcements
Director Rahaim:
The announcement I wanted to make is just a quick update on the Market Octavia Survey process which I think some of you have been interested in hearing.There was a public meeting on that last week I believe on the 9th.There was some discussion on the implementation of the survey in light of the fact that it happened in phases.That discussion was had with the community at that meeting.My sense from staff is that there was an understanding of how we were proceeding.The basic schedule is that we will initiate the survey at the commission later this month; go to the Historic Preservation Commission in mid August meeting (the 19th); come to you for adoption in early September of the latest phase of the survey; and then the Mission Dolores draft survey is scheduled to be released sometime in the middle of fall.The remaining portion of the Market Octavia Survey – what we call the Augmentation Survey – is still about a year away and due to be released next fall.So that is moving along and we have committed to the neighborhood that the survey information would be incorporated/implemented into the Plan in phases over the next year to a year and a half.
Acting Zoning Administrator Nikitas:
I wanted to update you on a couple of aspects of the Department's Action Plan.First, Ms. John-Baptiste will be here next week to give you a quarterly report on the progress we've made on the many elements of it.I did want to let you know that last Thursday Mr. Sanchez hosted the second community meeting on the Universal Planning Notification effort.As you are aware, we have over 30 different kinds of notifications for different cases, entitlements, and processes.We are trying to condense those down.We received valuable feedback at that meeting and Mr. Sanchez will be here on August 13 to give you an update on that as that aspect of the Action Plan progresses.
