8.Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Moore:
She wanted to bring to the Commission's attention an article from the San Francisco Business Times.It talks about the value of entitled land plummeting dramatically in San Francisco.It contains a number of projects that were recently approved.One is 1285 Sutter Street.That is the one that has the Costco on the bottom.There is 45 Lansing and 375-399 Fremont.I am very concerned about what that does with our ability to be prepared for growth.And more importantly what that means for projects that are in front of us, which we are continuing to approve, being pressured by labor and by the construction industry to approve, approve, approve.And when it comes to waiting for [beginning] points, these deals are not being delivered.Not that people don't try, but it seems to be an economically unfavorably climate.I am concerned how we are continuing to approve in an environment when there is no [value].
Commissioner Borden:
I too saw that article, and I'm asking Zoning Administrator Badiner about it because some of the properties listed are on our continuance calendar next week.Maybe Zoning Administrator can explain that.
Zoning Administrator Badiner responds:
I have asked if they intend to pursue their entitlement extensions, which is different than their building permit which they have withdrawn.In theory and legally, they can ask for an extension on their entitlement.When they informed us that they were withdrawing their building permit, I was under the impression that they would not pursue the entitlement extension, but we are trying to ascertain whether they still want to.
Commissioner Borden:
Also, what was interesting about that article is they talked about the difference in cost between steel-frame and wood-frame buildings, and the fact that the plummeting land values makes holding entitlements for steel-frame buildings not valuable.So the extensions won't be sought is they don't really plan to build because it's not as valuable these days.Another point I want to bring us is maybe we can have a hearing on grocery stores.We're going to have a project later where we talk about having a grocery store on the ground level.We had a project recently, TNDC that wants to do a grocery store.I just talked to a developer that is working on the site at California and Hyde where CALA is going to be leaving and they are hoping to do some sort of store there.I know in the Richmond District by Lincoln Park, there was a grocery store there that is now vacant.There is the old Bell Market at Post and Franklin that is now vacant.Maybe we can bring in some representatives of some of the grocery stores like Safeway, Whole Foods, Molly Stone, Trader Joes and look at the economic development issues and strategy.Some of our projects are setting up to have groceries stores because there is a desire for them, but there is also a concern that grocery stores are making different decisions about whether or notthey locate.It would be interesting to have a hearing and get to the bottom of this issue.
Commissioner Antonini:
I would agree.I think that would be very instructive because there may be a lot of factors that are involved that have nothing to do with the current economic situation.On a more positive note, the May 15 - 21 San Francisco Business Times article talks about Bay Area Economy Shows Signs of Life.Spike in condo sales makes come back.It goes on to note the Infinity had 90 contracts signed in 90 days, which isn't too bad.The 114 unit Blue on Folsom had eight units in a month.The SOMA Grand had 12 units this month and they are 75% sold out.And even Candlestick Point had nine units sold in four weeks.The bad side of it was that most of these sales came at a price reduction at or below the cost of the unit.But it is an encouraging sign that hopefully will continue.In terms of our approval of projects,, I think we have to look at it in terms of whether or we think it is a good project or not.No project gets built that we don't approve, but a fairly high percentage of the projects approved since I've been on the Commission have actually come to fruition, although some of them take a couple of years to get going.
Commissioner Sugaya:
In the Work Program for the Department, you are undertaking a study of 4thStreet.Could we get a update on that at some point?Secondly, I'd like to get an informational hearing what is going on with the Mid-Market revitalization efforts.I've seen some drawings that have been prepared for a property owner named Mr. Addington.I think he is trying to revitalize the theatre district.I believe the presentation was being made to the San Francisco Architectural Heritage Issues Committee.I'm not sure, but I'd like an informational hearing on that.
Commissioner Miguel:
I had the pleasure last week of spending some time with a Mr. Takashi Oda, a gentleman from Japan here finishing up his Fulbright.I met him at the Japantown meeting in which he's been very involved.It's been very interesting comparing how governmental bodies work Japan to the United States and to San Francisco in particular.We went over some of the cultural history as well as some of the planning history.I've met with people this last week regarding Fox Plaza, California/Hyde, 10thand Market, and 10thand Mission, with the Prada Group regarding future projects.There was a meeting at the Department yesterday on the Universal Planning Notification, which was not well attended by the general public in spite of notification.The Department did a very good job of putting forth what is on paper so far, but that is a work in progress.I had a meeting with others of the Department and Eric Mar regarding DR Reform to bring his up to date on it.I'd like Commissioners to weigh in on whether or not we should take a holiday from our hearing on July 2nd.
Commissioner Antonini:
I want to also note that I too spoke with the project sponsor for Fox Plaza.In regards to the 2nd, you know that I am always willing to go along with whatever the will of the Commission is, but given a choice I would rather have an extra session than be here until midnight especially when we start early.So if there is any chance to move any calendared item from the future or things that might get continued to that day.I'm perfectly fine with meeting.If the holiday is on the Friday, I don't see the conflict with the Thursday, but I may be missing something.
Commission Secretary Avery responds:
From a personal point of view:The holiday is on Friday and that is the day I get your calendars out for the following week.It's a holiday.Everybody will be gone and I'd like to also be gone.If I observe the holiday, I won't be here to get a calendar out for the following week.If you cancel the hearing for the 2ndI would be able to get your calendar for the following week out on the 2nd.You can have a hearing on the 2nd, but it would probably mean that you would not be able to have a hearing on [the 9th] because I would be unable to get a legal calendar out.
Commissioner Antonini:
Thank you for that explanation.Now it makes sense.I think it would probably be better to have the hearing on the 9thinstead of the 2ndgiven the choice.
Commissioner Moore:
Thank you Commissioner Antonini.I thing in terms of overall resource conservation and staff, I think it's a great idea.I think one of the requests we could make if we do have two meetings on a day would be that the meetings are balanced out so that we don't sit here until midnight.I don't mind coming in at 10:30 [a.m.] using the day efficiently and the afternoon is not burdened with very difficult cases.
Commissioner Miguel:
If there is no objection.That is censuses.
Commission Secretary Avery:
Thank you.For the record and for the public, the hearing for July 2ndhas been canceled.
9.Director's Announcements
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
Director Rahaim is speaking downtown and should be here very soon.There are two things I want to bring to your attention.The first is we held the first meeting on our universal planning notice this past Tuesday.It was attended by six of seven peopleThis was the first meeting to discuss simplifying our noticing process; standardizing our noticing process; cutting down from 40 to 45 different kinds of notices to something that is a little more constrained.There were a lot of good ideas.People want to take advantage of electronics, email where possible.People were concerned about consistency.President Miguel was there also.I thought it was a useful kickoff to the discussion.We hope more people join us in that process.We will have another meeting soon.We hope to have something before the Commission in August.The other thing I want to bring to your attention is I had received a request for an extension on a project and I have granted that.It is a case at 324 Courtland Street.The Commission had a CU on May 25, 2006 and I had a variance.The project was demolition and new construction.It was a new 3-story building with ground floor retail space and two residential townhouse units.The extension was from the three year performance requirement.DBI has had in recent years a new acoustic report requirement and they have been going back and forth internally on how to implement that report and when and where it's required.I granted them a six month extension.They believe the permit will be granted within the next few months.This was the classic case where the city has delayed the implementation of a project.The extension seemed to make sense.

D.GENERALPUBLIC COMMENT – 15 MINUTES
At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting.Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
SPEAKERS:
Louise Williams, Miguel Gomez, and Jim Salinas, Sr. spoke on City Build and how they are not in compliance with their commitment to employ San Franciscan's on many of these construction jobs.
Starchildspoke on the process today.The planning process increases the animosity between citizens or groups.We would be much better served by a process in which people or if a person has legitimate title to a piece of property, they can do whatever they want with that property as long as they don't infringe on the life, liberty or property of anyone else.People shouldn't have veto power over a project just because they happen to live in the neighborhood.This process is destroying our economy.
Sue Hestor- The Fox Plaza project that is scheduled to come before the Commission next week.Fox Plaza is the most notorious intersection for winds in the city.This is regarding the timing of staff reports.When the Downtown Plan was adopted, there was an explicit requirement in section 309 that says that if you are requesting exceptions, the staff report has to be available 10 days in advance.The 10 day requirement applies to all C-3 projects and all Rincon Hill projects that request exceptions.I called the Department on it yesterday.Not only should the staff report be available, but it must be physically in the notice that the staff report is available 10 days in advance.I told staff that they could not have a hearing [on Fox Plaza] because that requirement was not met.If the hearing goes forward next week, I am prepared to go to court about the lack of compliance.
Director Rahaimresponded that the Department would put in memo form what the Department's practices are for the Commission's review and schedule for general discussion in a couple of weeks.From that discussion, if you [the Commission] feel it necessary to calendar a review of your Rules and Regulations, you can do so at that time.
