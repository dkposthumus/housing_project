15.2006.0203E(C. Dovzak:(415) 575-9030)
San Andreas Pipeline No.3 Installation Project-Public Hearing in the Draft Environmental Impact Report. The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) is sponsoring a proposed project that requires the installation of approximately 23,400 feet (4.4 miles) of new pipeline to extend the existing San Andreas Pipeline No. 3 (SAPL3) from the San Pedro Valve Lot (SPVL) in Daly City to Merced Manor Reservoir (MMR) in San Francisco. For approximately half its length, the pipeline would follow the alignment of the Baden Merced Pipeline, which has been taken out of service because of its deteriorated condition. For the other sections of the pipeline, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) has chosen alternative routes to minimize environmental impacts. Where the proposed SAPL 3 alignment differs from the existing BMPL alignment, the BMPL would either be filled with a concrete slurry mixture or would be capped. The alignment follows city streets, except in two locations (the San Francisco Golf Club and the Lake Merced Golf Club). The Project would be constructed using the open-trench method ( cut and cover ) for most of the pipeline and a trenchless ( jack and bore ) method at high-traffic intersections (at John Daly Boulevard and Sheffield Drive in Daly City, at 19th Avenue and Crespi/Holloway Avenue in San Francisco, and at 19th Avenue and Eucalyptus Drive in San Francisco). In addition to the pipeline main, the Project also includes the installation of crossover pipelines, five customer service connections, various underground vaults, appurtenances, and a cathodic projection system.Key features of the proposed Project include:
