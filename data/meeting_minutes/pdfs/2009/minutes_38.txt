5.Commission Comments/Questions
Commission Secretary Avery:
Commissioners if I can take just one moment of your time.Let me just state for the public and you:As the Commission Secretary I have established a procedural policy that I use all the time.When I am here at these meetings, it is very difficult for me to handle processing of mail or material that does not relate to the meeting that we are engaged in at that time.For the public, [the policy] is stated on the front of our calendars under Meeting Procedures, it is very important that they not give me material for you (the commission) that is for next week's packet or some other meeting three months down the road.It needs to go to the Department so it can be processed.And if you give it to me here, I consider that correspondence.I did accept material today and only did so because I was told copies were delivered at the Department so they will be processed there.But it is just so difficult for me to try to handle this hearing and next week and the week after and others down the road.So I'm asking the public to look at the front of the calendar under Meeting Procedures and please, don't bring your material here for me to process [if it does not relate to matters on that day's calendar].Thank you.
Commissioner Miguel:
Thank you for that explanation.I'm sure it's possible that people don't necessarily read the front of the calendar.I do understand the situation because if that continues, you would have a pile of papers with no relationship to when it should be processed.They should come to the office without question.
On Commissioner's Comments, I would like to publicly thank the Housing Action Coalition for presenting yesterday evening to the Planning Commission their annual Housing Hero Award.It was a very nice affair.It was very well attended by a large segment of the involved community in San Francisco – involved in housing and land use affairs.And although I was asked if I would, I did not wear the Superman style red satin cape they presented me to this hearing.I felt it might be a touch inappropriate, but it was greatly appreciated.
Commissioner Moore:
I'd like to acknowledge Dan Sider and staff for the de-brief on proposition D.I think that is a really good piece of work which prompted me to ask Secretary Avery to have all special requests, which are part of our Action Agenda, in an on-going binder or electronic file where we can retrieve and other people over time can go back.It's a very through work which the Planning Department is doing impromptu without it having been scheduled in their regular work schedule.It is a good piece of work and I think everybody should read that.
On another note:I attended the Mission Street neighborhood meeting on Tuesday evening in the Mission.The meeting was quite good and well organized.Staff was very strong in handling the meeting with input from a variety of people – property owners, residents, etc.There was a slight absence of the Spanish speaking community. I'm not sure why.I meant to talk with Commissioner Olague as to whether or not that requires special organization and/or a special kind of outreach.At least I believe the project is having a healthy discussion, but I do believe that the local community needs to be brought into the discussion and have a voice one way or the other.
I'm not sure if everybody is aware of this, but we will have the opportunity for $20 a shot to get the inspiration for luxury, high-rise living by visiting Rincon One, which is open between September 19 and November 1st, for people who are interested to see this project.I found it amusing to see a $20 fee, but I will not further comment on it; let that stand on its own; at least we can get an inspiration of luxury high-rise living.
Commissioner Antonini:
First of all, my thanks also to the Housing Action Coalition for last night's event.It was very nice.They certainly are the proverbial big tent of housing I think and I really appreciate their recognition.
Also, today I attended Governor Schwarzenegger's Green Initiatives speech and Q & A at the Commonwealth Club in regards to the environmental movement in California.It sort of ties into a Letter to the Editor I had in the Examiner today, which actually I compared and contrasted the conditions at Candlestick Park last Sunday with what it would have been if the game had been played in Santa Clara.Interestingly enough the temperature in San Francisco was about 79Âºwith a gentle breeze and clean air and the conditions would have been 93Âºin Santa Clara and still unhealthy air, which is quite typical for that area in the fall.I went to school down there from1964 to 1968 and I don't think it has gotten any better as far as the conditions.Also, the other thing is public transit.I would think well over 20% of the people at that game took public transit, which I did.We took the T back and we saw all these people getting off at BART because they've learned, as they do for games at AT&T, they can do the same thing if they come to Candlestick if they are coming from the Eastbay.Those options won't exist in Santa Clara because there aren't those transit agencies close by that site.So what does this have to do with planning?It does have to do with the fact that they're finishing up a DEIR on the Santa Clara Stadium.The comment period is ending on Monday I believe.I happened to get a copy of it and there are some glaring errors when they talk about alternatives being the San Francisco Stadium alternative.One of them is that they claim that Prop G precludes a retrofit of Candlestick; and they also talk about the $100 million dollars out of revenue rather than as a pre-condition for development.My question hypothetically is when another area analysis something in your county or city and they do it in error, is it something that we should answer?Just as if we were doing something and analyzing an alternative in some other county or city, I would expect they would have some comment on it.I don't know what or how this is.I'm going to talk to Bill Wycko or somebody.Mr. Badiner said that might be a good idea, just to find out how these things should be handled in the future if there are errors that involve your jurisdiction.
Commissioner Sugaya:
Just to follow up on Proposition D and the memo – I thought it was very good.Can we have any kind of presentation or anything like that?I know that we can't take a position on it because it's a Proposition and it's political.
Director Rahaim:
My understanding is that we can have a presentation and talk about [it] objectively, but we or you can not take a position.
Commissioner Sugaya:
I'd like to have the Commission consider that because it seems to me that it's an extremely important topic.
Commissioner Moore:
That, and informing the public & ...
Commissioner Sugaya:
Yes, I think that on the face of it, it sounds great.When I first heard about it I thought this will liven up [] and everything.But then reading through the analysis and reading the text I think it's much broader than I thought it was going to be.I have some concerns about it, but maybe we can have a presentation and talk objectively.That's what we do.Ms. Stacy do you have any & .
Deputy City Attorney Kate Stacy:
Commissioner Sugaya I will check in with our Fair Political Practices Act experts.I think that as the Director has indicated, certainly there could be an informational presentation, but at this point the Commission needs to be careful about using City resources to take positions on the item.But I'll get back to the Director and the President with our FPPC expert [opinion].
Commissioner Sugaya:
I just believe something like an informational presentation would be good, especially for the public because I know that this issue has been taken for example to the San Francisco Architectural Heritage for endorsement among other groups.
In the Examiner of the 22nd[9/22/09],  Barriers to New Business  – I was just curious about the headline and actually it turned out to be again about Mr. Sider's report on the neighborhood commercial history of the city.It doesn't seem like it was the same presentation that I heard or the same document that I read.They tried to attribute a quote to him which says that  piecemeal changes to the Zoning Code are outdated and prevent desirable businesses from moving into neighborhoods, etc.  according to Mr. Sider.That doesn't sound like him to me.
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
I talked to Mr. Sider this morning about this report and interestingly enough, he was not interviewed for this report.He indicated to me that the reporting had been done probably from either that side of the podium or viewing it on line, which is possible.So he does not deny that those quotes were made, but they may have been in the context of a much larger report.
Commissioner Sugaya:
We don't want to give any more credence to it than that.Lastly, it was today's paper [that] had an editorial in it regarding the potential closure – I couldn't quite understand exactly what they were going to do in the Presidio.Were they going to be restricting traffic?The paper had some good points and perhaps we could have somebody contact the Presidio and see exactly what they are going to be doing.It's in the quise of trying to accommodate traffic and change driving habits because of the changes at Doyle Drive is what the Presidio Trust said.Apparently they are going to prevent traffic coming through either Arguello or Presidio Blvd.Mr. Antonini, do you know?
Commissioner Antonini:
The way I read it, it sounded like it's going to be Presidio Blvd. which is one of the major ways in and out.I'm not quite sure.
Director Rahaim:
I'll get you more information on that.My impression was that it was some of the smaller streets that did not include for example bus routes, but we'll get you more information on that.
Commissioner Sugaya:
Thank you.
Commissioner Olague:
I'd like to have a hearing on that Prop D.And I loved the report.It was really very well done by Mr. Sider.I think I remember reading the latest FPPC kind of guidelines for election periods that was sent to us by the City Attorney's Office.I remember reading in there that we could have objective hearings but we as a commission can't endorse a proposition.So maybe we can have an objective hearing here.I'm not sure if anyone at the HPC would be interested in reading this document, but it might be something that they might find interesting too.You may want to forward it to them in their packets.
About a week ago or so we mentioned – we were talking about two bedrooms v three bedrooms and someone mentioned that they had some units that were two bedrooms plus.I just wanted to mention that two bedrooms plus doesn't really count as three bedrooms because the plus doesn't include windows frequently and other Code issues that are required in three bedrooms.I just don't think it's fair to say that we have two bedrooms plus.I just wanted to mention that because there is a huge difference in the Code at least, and in the quality of life of a two bedroom v a three bedroom.I'm glad they have two bedrooms plus, but I think there is a huge difference.
I was wondering too if the CAC of the Eastern Neighborhoods would be involved at all in some of these discussions of the Mission heights.I'm just curious.I know they just formed.
Director Rahaim:
We are formulating that first agenda, but yeah, I would assume they would be involved
Commissioner Olague:
That would be great.I would be interested in having their input before we start deliberating on that here.
I heard similar concerns as Commissioner Moore mentioned on the Mission.We can talk about that more about some outreach strategies.
I believe there is a $20 fee being charged for the One Rincon tour.Is that going to an in-lieu fee?I know the economy is bad, but I think it might be nice to do that tour – (I'm just being silly).
I think that's it really.I think the main thing I was distracted by was the three bedroom discussion a few weeks ago.
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
Commissioner, if I recall correctly, the Project Sponsor acknowledged that there weren't three bedrooms and had said they could look at converting the two bedrooms with dens into three bedrooms.My recollection was that the condition was that they examine that, but I don't think they made the equivalent that a two bedroom plus was three bedrooms.
Commissioner Olague:
Okay, that is good to know.It was a good discussion.
Commissioner Sugaya:
If I might, also there has been some relaxation in the Codes as of January in certain situations where rooms that couldn't be considered habitable are now considered to be habitable.
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
I have been told, as ridicules as it may be, the new Code may not require any windows for a bedroom.I can't swear to that, but that's a bedroom I wouldn't want to particularly sleep in.But I do believe as Commissioner mentioned, they have been liberalized greatly.I think it's called the New IBC that was adopted January 1st, which I think is a National Code.Again, I'm not speaking from my expertise.It is a Building Code issue.
Commissioner Miguel:
It would be interesting if we could get something definitive on that.
Commissioner Sugaya:
The one small thing I do know is that if you had a situation previously where you had a totally enclosed room without any light or ventilation, you couldn't have it enclosed, you had to have it open.Now it is permitted to have an internal wall with a door on it.
Commissioner Borden:
I do want to thank the HAC for recognizing the Commission.I felt it was very kind of them to acknowledge us in that way.
I actually want to talk about another item.I know we have two cases on calendar today related to massage establishments and one of the issues or questions that came up is the process in which notification to the Police Department [is made] on a site.One of the challenges that Ms. Vaughey actually looked into is that of a location of a massage parlor but the ownership changes.Then the records kind of get re-set within the Police Department.So if you had five family members, or cousins, or even unrelated people all operating a massage establishment in some location, when that new location would go in there wouldn't be any violations listed because there was a new owner and it kind of resets the clock.So in looking at the policy around massage parlors, how we as staff when we talk to the police, do investigations into whether or not there are any issues - especially if they own any other locations within the city; and also how to deal with repeat offenders on a location – not necessarily specific to the owner.That is just something I wanted to bring up.It is not specific to either case we have on calendar today but it is related.
Commissioner Antonini:
In regards to a possible hearing regarding Prop D, I would ask the City Attorney if public comment would be allowed and would commissioners be allowed to comment informationally on anything they may find that they don't agree with – although I haven't read it in detail, I'm sure Mr. Sider's report is very through and complete.
6.Director's Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Good afternoon everyone.Let me add my congratulations to all of you for your Housing Hero Awards yesterday.It was a very nice event and very kind of the Housing Action Coalition.
As a reminder, I will be missing the next two meetings.I will be back east on a speaking engagement and some vacation time.
I want to remind you and the public as well that on September 30, that is next Wednesday evening at 6 p.m., we have the latest public meeting coming up on the Northeast Waterfront work that we are doing.This will take place at 6 p.m. in the Port Commission room in the Ferry Building.At this meeting staff will present our initial recommendations for the direction of the parking lot sites along that part of the waterfront.
Finally, I just wanted to mention that there had been a lot of discussion the last couple of weeks and some media attention paid to this proposal or this concept that had been in the Department about providing additional support to the Environmental Review staff.We have had several discussions with the staff about it and I wanted to let you know that the decision that I made this week was move ahead with that program with the use of temporary staff on an as-needed basis.The idea is to set up a system whereby certain types of projects with the agreement of the Environmental Review Officer could pay an expedited fee to have additional support provided to a project.We would use that fee to then hire temporary staff to help with that project.We will give that a try for the next year or so to see how that works.We will develop some protocols and criteria of what types of projects may use this service and under what conditions we would decide to proceed with this.We want to give this a try and I do want to say that frankly there was a fair amount of mis-information out there about this – that it was going to eliminate staff positions and all this.It clearly was not the intent and it was not going to happen that way.But none the less, these things do tend to get a bit out of control.We are going to try it on this basis for about a year and if we feel that we can – and staff had a number of ideas of how we might use consultants on a limited fashion on this and we might try that next year, but as a first phase, we are going to try to do it with temporary staff.
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
Commissioners I just wanted to add my congratulations and I'm sorry that I could not have been there, but congratulations.It was a well deserved honor.
On a different item:1250 Missouri– I think commissioners remember that case – I think on Monday in my absence, staff reviewed the final plans as submitted with Supervisor Maxwell and her staff.We are now prepared to sign off on these plans.The plans reflect what the Commission indicated.The [] bars have been moved; the fireplaces have been re-moved; the appropriate plumbing has been re-moved; and the baths have been removed; and there is direct access to the mezzanines through walkway systems.So we are prepared to sign off on those plans.I believe we are just awaiting some technical details and I think it may also be subject to some fees, but we are looking into that.I wanted to let the Commission know because you wanted to be kept abreast of that wonderful project.
