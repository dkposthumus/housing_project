B.COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
3.Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Antonini:
He reported on a SPRU presentation in the latest issue of the Urbanist that dealt with sustainable planning to bring jobs back to the city.They did a marvelous job of pointing out what we have in San Francisco, which is one of the densest and most well served by transit business districts in the United States.There is over 85 mission square feet of office space in downtown San Francisco.The regrettable part is that in the last 10 years in downtown San Francisco only about 5 million square feet of office space has been developed and in suburban areas there has been about 40 million square feet.The point they make is that in SF well over 50% of the people that work there reach their destination by transit, another 10% walk or ride bicycles to work, while 30-35% take autos.In suburban office parks less than 5% take public transit and places like Bishop Ranch, they take less than 1% public transit to their jobs.They had an overlay that showed inefficient land use in suburban office parks vs. San Francisco.He requested a hearing on this because it is such an important subject because if you really want to protect the environment, this is one of the biggest possible things you can do to keep pollution down is to have people work in areas where they can take public transportation to their work and not have to drive and/or be closer to where they may live.Finally, I think that as a national policy it would behoove us to give tax incentives to companies to locate their businesses in center cities that are served by transit to save the environment, to not duplicate services, to give people more leisure time, more time to exercise and not sit in a car.
Commissioner Moore:
As SPUR members, I'm sure we have all received this documentI really glad that SPUR is shaping policy.I would be interesting to have a presentation that gets into the nuts and bolts and looks at the caring capacity of the City as densification and greening are issues which find a balance somewhere else along the line.I hope that together with the Department we can have this great work discussed in front of the commission and the public so that it helps us create policy that is informed and looks at all the issues in a balanced way.
Commissioner Lee:
I share those same comments of the two commissioners, but parallel to this, I think Mayor Newsom announced this past week that we have another biotech hedge fund moving to San Francisco.With Alexandria slowing down or stopping their development, what I would like to have is maybe Michael Cohen a list of all the biotech companies that have relocated or are now in San Francisco.Second, do we have an estimate of how much space we have left for biotech companies that would include lab and office space?We need to get a break line of where we are with the biotech.Through the President to Director Rahaim, could we get a letter to Michael Cohen asking for a snap shot view of where we are and how many companies, etc.
Commissioner Borden:
I too read the SPUR report, and what I thought was interesting was the discussion about people taking transit when it is close to their job, not necessarily their homes.That people were willing to walk farther, even drive to a BART or MUNI station as opposed to when they get close to their jobs they want to be within a couple of blocks.I thought it was very interesting and illuminated the transit effect of this project.It would be great if we could have a hearing with MUNI to look at that because the report did also address the capacity issues at the Embarcadero and Montgomery stations.When you talk about densification issues, right now we are not at a capacity level to increase ridership to those stations.I think from a planning perspective we need to make sure we are aligned with MUNI on this.I also want to bring up again these hearings on the neighborhood commercial corridors.As our calendars are kind of shout it gives us an opportunity to look at the various neighborhood corridors and how we can look at planning issues and potentially bring in landlords and others (like the Property Management Association).It would be interesting to bring all those people together because I think there is a disconnect between people who own property and people who occupy property as far as commercial space, and having them understand the needs of the city.
Commissioner Lee:
When we have a joint hearing with the Small Business Commission we should discuss the NC zoning and how that applicable to what we can do in the city to help out not just the business, but also the property owner.
Commissioner Sugaya:
The Piazza St Francis or St. Francis Piazza, which is something being promoted by North Beach residents.It said in the article that the Mayor and the City Planning Commission are in favor, and I don't know that the Piazza has been before the Commission, at least not since I've been here.
Director Rahaimagreed that it had not been before the Commission.
Commissioner Miguel:
He attended two meeting this week hosted by the Department.One was on 1650 Broadway, which was not totally successful.The other was for 100 32ndAvenue, which was much more successful.It just proved that if we go through our pre-application process and maybe intensify it, a lot of the problems that could come up later could at least be aired in the beginning and clarified.I also attended a Potrero Hill Democratic Club meeting at which the Hope SF project on Potrero Hill was viewed.
Commissioner Olague:
She apologized to the neighbors of 1650 Broadway for not being able to attend that meeting.She was sick.She did attend a meeting today on the 20thand Valencia project.
Commissioner Lee:
I heard a rumor today that A.F. Evans declared bankruptcy.Can someone verify that?
Commissioner Miguel:
He confirmed that A.F. Evans filed Chapter 11 and further stated that the company expressed their intent to complete the two major projects (including 55 Laguna) they have started in San Francisco.
Commissioner Antonini:
He participated in the 1650 Broadway meeting.
Commissioner Moore:
She participated in a meeting with Department staff and Director Rahaim on the next generation of neighborhood residential guidelines. She is very happy with the way it is going.
4.Director's Announcements
Director Rahaim:
