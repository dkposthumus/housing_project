C.COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
7.Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Antonini:
I met with project sponsors in regards to Cal Pacific.I made a request on 4/23 about considering whether it's appropriate, based on the fact that we are considering entitlement extensions of Rincon Hill projects, to consider nexus study to see if these are still appropriate in today's economic climate.I want to ask staff for a response.My idea is not so specific to Rincon Hill, but I want to see if nexus exists between Market-rate development on vacant and under utilized land and adjacent neighborhoods, and if it does, what is the nature of this affect?Is it a positive affect, a negative affect, or no affect at all?I think, moving forward, it is important to realize whether or not this is a special situation where an agreement or condition was made, or whether there is a nexus that exists in these instances because as we consider future area plans we have to know what might exist there.It is an idea that might be worth considering.Now that we are reconsidering entitlements, we've got a period of time when nothing is being done.It's an issue that comes up frequently because as we see development we want to know what are the affects on the area in question and even on the adjacent areas or areas that are not even adjacent.I think it is important that these questions be answered in a generic way.
Commissioner Lee:
Last week the Northern California APA gave an award to EDAW and the Mayor's Office for a report they did for the Chinatown Economic Action Plan.I thought EDAW through the Mayor's Office did a very good job.I wanted to see if the city could use this Action Plan for the Mission since we've had a lot of issues re-zoning the Mission and with job creation.I'd like Director Rahaim to contact them and see if we can do the same type of Economic Action Plan for the Mission.
Commissioner Borden:
There was a rumor going around this week about the Tonga Room shutting down, or not shutting down.What is going on with it – the Fairmont project?We got some documents awhile ago but I haven't seen anything about it recently.The scare about it closing down, which was false, made me wonder what the status is.
Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:
They have filed for environmental review.The Department is performing environmental review.They have a proposal for removing and rebuilding the tower and some of the space at the rear of the building on Powell Street.That will eventually come before this Commission.I have also heard discussions about land marking the Tonga Room.
Commissioner Borden:
I also want to know when the Bicycle EIR will come before us (the Commission).
Director Rahaim responded:
The final EIR will come before this commission next month in June for certification.I don't know the exact date.
Commissioner Borden:
I noticed that for the DBI agenda at 6 o'clock tonight, we didn't get anything in our packets.Are there items or materials that we should have gotten?
Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:
Neither the Planning Department nor DBI prepared information handouts in advance.We are just going to give presentations as we go forward.
Commissioner Borden:
I appreciate that.I think in the future if we could get something in advance, we can probably have a more substantive discussion at the hearing.I think it is harder when we are absorbing the information at the same time we are getting it.It just makes it a little more complicated and I think you don't think of everything that you would have thought of if you knew in advance.Other than that, I met with the project sponsor of 1415 Mission Street.
Commissioner Moore:
I want to formally ask staff to schedule another meeting with the Recreation & Park Commission to follow up with a more policy-oriented discussion on shadow and open space, existing open spaces, spaces that were acquired or put into place after prop K, and potential open spaces that are coming up.I am particularly thinking about the Transbay Terminal and 5.3 acres of open space and that responsibility.Who will share it?What obligations will we try to encourage this development to bring forward?
Commissioner Olague:
I want to agree with Commissioner Moore and what she said about the joint hearing today with Park/Rec.I was reminded during the discussion that part of why we continued it out was in hopes that the study we were anticipating would enrich our discussion with Park/Rec about open space and prop K.I think a lot of those issues need to be fully vetted with Park/Rec because we are seeing a lot of additional cumulative shadow being proposed for the downtown area.I would like to have a more intense policy discussion on access too.I'm not convinced that people feel welcome.There are invisible barriers outside of cultural barriers, not just physical barriers that keep people from choosing where they would spend their time as far as open space activities are concerned.I think it goes deeper than just providing a physical space.There are access issues.I haven't read the Economic Action Plan from EDAW, but I would argue that before we jump and decide we want something similar done in the Mission that we would take into consideration what is currently being done as far as economic development in the Mission.It may be that people are already working on a lot of similar types of plans.I know that MEDA is engaged in things.I think The Mayor's Office of Economic Workforce Development is [also].I think a lot of economic development work and analysis is going on in the Mission.It may just be a duplicative and unnecessary effort to engage yet another study on the Mission and economic development.
Commissioner Sugaya:
I hope my fellow commissioners take this as constructive criticism, but to start this meeting 25 minutes late is a disservice to both members of the audience who were here on time and other commissioners who happened to be here on time at 1:30.
Commissioner Miguel:
I also met during the last two week with CPMC regarding their Institutional Master Plan.I had the pleasure of being at the Potrero Boosters when the Department did an excellent presentation on the Housing Element.May 16 will be the opening of the Richmond branch library on 9thAvenue between Geary and Clement.I've had the pleasure of working with that group since this project started.I think you would be pleased with how it was done.To me it is an excellent example of the Secretary of Interior's guidelines.Last Saturday I attended the Rebuild Potrero design workshop for rebuilding the projects there.Tenants from the project were there.They held two sessions, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.Nine of the residents participated in a bar-b-q cook off and four of us had the pleasure of being judges.That was very nice and the project is going very well.
8.Director's Announcements
Director Rahaim:
He attended the annual conference of the American Planning Association in Minneapolis at the end of week before last.As you know I participated in an all-day session on green communities with some planners and attorneys from New York.We had a very interesting discussion and there were about 150 people in attendance for the entire day.Also, last week the National AIA convention was in town and I participated in two sessions there.There were a lot of positive comments about San Francisco and the work that we are doing here.Although attendance was considered lower than normal, there were still about 20,000 architects in town for the AIA convention.On Monday evening, I attended the annual meeting of the Presidio Heights Association and had a very lively discussion about a number of issues of concern.Two most interesting issues for the community right now are the proposed Presidio revised Master Plan and the Housing Element.We have kicked off the open space planning effort for Showplace Square, which was one of the follow up efforts for the Eastern Neighborhoods process.We are hoping to have that done in a fairly short time of about three months.
David Alumbaugh (gave an update of work the Department is doing with DPW and MTA):
The Planning Department has been working with the Mayor's Office, the Director of DPW and SFMTA on a number of temporary projects to reclaim some excessive street space around the city.We call the program Pavement to Parks.The idea is to use found materials from the city yards and using simple construction techniques to inexpensively and quickly transform street space into public plazas.The first demonstration project will be a temporary closure to vehicle traffic of 17thStreet where it intersects Market and Castro Streets.On this project we are working with Supervisor Dufty and the Castro CDD and other neighborhood groups to articulate the way that project should go forward.Others are pitching in as well.The creation of this plaza is intended to begin this week with the closure on Sunday of the street and a couple of days of retrofitting work and the formal opening sometime next week.

Supervisor Daly introduced an amendment to the Administrative Codethat would change the qualification as well as the number of members to the Eastern Neighborhood CAC.Currently they are appointed by the Mayor's Office or the Board of Supervisors.This amendment would allow the Western SOMA Citizen's Task Force to also appoint one member.This is not a Planning Code amendment, but it does affect planning and land use related items.If the commission would like to hear it, you have 30 days to consider it.

SPEAKERS:
Pier Lowe– I was the DR requestor for a property at 4024 26thStreet that you heard.You took DR and required matching light wells and that the rear depth of the 3rdfloor in the rear align with adjacent buildings.My wife and I believe the project sponsors are in violation of your decision.
Mr. Razinsky– I am the other adjacent neighbor of 4024 26thStreet.What you approved is not what the Department is about to approve.And the third floor deck was never noticed or before you.
Joe Butler, Represented Mr.Razinsky at the DR hearing of 4024 26thStreet.My client and Mr. Lowe would be happy to trade the new envelope that was not noticed and which we do not find offensive for the new third floor deck, which was also not noticed and which we do find offensive.If they want a deck, they should apply for it.
