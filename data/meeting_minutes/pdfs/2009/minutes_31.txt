Following this endorsement staff, in coordination with the community, developed recommendations, both General Plan and Zoning Map amendments, for, among other things, (1) the integration of these findings into the Market and Octavia Plan as required by the Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors at Plan approval, and (2) proposed height changes for parcels within the proposed Upper Market Historic District.

Adoption of Commission Minutesâ Charter Section 4.104 requires all commissioners to vote yes or no on all matters unless that commissioner is excused by a vote of the Commission.Commissioners may not be automatically excluded from a vote on the minutes because they did not attend the meeting.

SPEAKERS:None
ACTION:Approved
AYES:Miguel, Olague, Antonini, Borden, Lee, Moore and Sugaya
18.Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Moore:
I had the good fortune of hearing Patrick Blanc, the Green Vertical Wall designer for Drew School the other day and I am incredibly enthused about what we approved.The project is going to be spectacular.This man gave a presentation which was taped based on the request of several people in attendance and I have suggested the entire Planning Department, and Director Rahaim agreed with that, listen to this tape and I hope that some of the commissioners will join in.It is just fantastic.
On a second thing:I raised a question a couple of weeks ago about how the traffic calming on Market Street was working.I have observed it [twice] since and it is settling in very nicely and it makes the street really good even in the tougher blocks, the ones we talked about earlier today.It makes a world of difference.I would strongly suggest if other findings substantiate this, that this become something that we look at more closely for a more permanent solution.It creates a completely different street.
Commissioner Sugaya:
If there is such a report, I assume it's going to include impacts to the side streets.
Director Rahaim:
Yes.That's been a big issue.The neighborhood is very interested in that.It's appearing that the impacts aren't as great as feared because traffic seems to be avoiding Market Street to begin with, but we will get a report on that.
19.Director's Announcements
Director Rahaim:
I believe you all got my email inviting you to this event with six Planning Directors.It's kind of an interesting opportunity and I'm very grateful to all the Directors for arranging their schedules to stay an extra day.
The next two days â tomorrow and Monday, we will have a two-day long management retreat for the Department that includes all Senior Managers and all Planner IVs.We will be held up for the next two days thinking about how we do business and how to do it differently.We have committed to making sure that the rest of staff is involved in the outcomes.We have kind of a phase two of this that we will be sharing with you and all of the Department.That is happening tomorrow and Monday, so we will be out of the office those two days.
Third, I just wanted to call your attention to the memo on the status of the Action Plan.I think we are making some progress on many items.And many items are overlapping in interesting ways.We have gotten some very positive feedback in recent months in recent meetings with the Advisory Committee.
20.Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS
Land Use Committee:
Full Board
BOARD OF APPEALS:
Commissioner Moore:
Mr. Badiner, could you give the Commission and for those who didn't follow the Supervisor's hearing on how the Main/Beal Street project was overturned?Could you describe that please, because it was so unusual that I had a hard time understanding of how we can deal with it?
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
I will attempt to express the issues.There were two basic concerns.One was green house gas, which at the time that we did the Rincon Hill EIR four or five years ago or beyond, was not an issue but is now an issue that we deal with customarily in environmental documents.The second was air quality and PM10 (particulate matter of under 10 micrograms or something like that).The Board requested re-studying the air quality affects on the proposed project's residents and on the existing residents at Bay Crest.For the proposed project there are ways to do a closed air system today (not operable windows although generally we think operable windows are good) you would have a closed air system that caught all the PM10.I don't know how you retrofit an existing building and it's not clear to me â and I was not there and I'm not an environmental expert â what affect this building would have on the PM10 on the existing building next door.It may have some.I'm not questioning the Board of Supervisors and their wisdom on this.I am not an environmental expert, but I am told that we will have to re-examine [because] it does not call the concept of community plan exemptions into question.I am told that this particular one had some issues.
HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:
