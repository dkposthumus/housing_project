C.COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
4.Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Moore:
I would like to ask that the Department help us to sort out a memo which was distributed last Thursday.It came to President Miguel and it came from the Academy, listing in random fashion of what they are doing, complying to, trying to alleviate, etc.That is not sufficient for me to see it accounted against the very thorough presentation Scott Sanchez made to us awhile back.We had asked a number of times that we get an update.I think this memo is a perfect tool to use the Academy's random accounting of what they are doing and have the Department give us an update on what is really happening.I would like to have the Commission support me on that and put it on our  to do  list and do that as quickly as possible.
Commissioner Olague:
I would like to support that too ASAP.I received the same memo from the Academy of Art and I would like the Department's perspective on it as well and I would like to not have to wait to get that hearing.So if there is a way we can prioritize that, maybe working with President Miguel, because I think this is timely and we need to know ASAP.
Commissioner Moore:
Thank you Commissioner Olague.I wanted to make a second comment that pertains to having received in a timely fashion information from the Mayor's Office of Economic and Workforce Development as it pertains to one of the issues on our agenda today.That particular memo and the summary of some of the legal as well as policy interpretation was extremely helpful for me.I just wanted to acknowledge that – not getting into detail – but just saying it's a very good way of communicating ahead of time on something of importance to us.
Commissioner Olague:
I need more information.Last week, I believe it was in the Chronicle, there was an article on MEA and the possible loss of a Civil Service position.I know there was a memo that went around that Local 21 testified to this Commission last year around the budget period and I would like to understand a little bit more.Today we did receive another letter from Local 21.I don't know if it would be something for a public hearing or not, but I was kind of taken off guard by it.I need more information I think.I want to understand.I don't know whether that would be in a public hearing; whether it would be &
Director Rahaim:
I would be happy to inform the Commission about what is happening there.I would suggest it may not be the subject of a public hearing, but I'm happy to write a memo about it.
Commissioner Olague:
Okay.I think it's pretty important.I've been getting emails and phone calls and I'm not sure how to respond.And maybe next time during the budget period I'm going to ask for probably more time and more hearings before voting on the budget.
Prop D is something that is coming up in the mid-Market signages and I would like the Department to give us some analysis of that.[Ms. Rodgers is usually here to do that.]
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
Commissioners as part of the City's process, the Department analyzed the affects of the proposed Charter amendments and we can put that analysis in your packets and if there is more information required, we will give it to you.Obviously, we didn't take a position on it because that would be inappropriate but we did an analysis that [blended] into the Charter Committee (I don't know what it's called) that does the summary.
Commissioner Antonini:
I also would like to comment on and thank Director Rahaim, Mr. Yarne, Local 21, all the people who are engaged in this process to try to see if we can make our environmental process more efficient.We all gain.Particularly in planning issues, efficiency is very important because it sends a message to developers that San Francisco has a process as efficient as other locations when they are choosing places to locate.Certainly less process means less cost as long as we are protected; that the analysis is a through one; and thirdly that these types of things will generate revenue.I guess the question that always comes up in these issues and one that we all deal with in businesses is how much of it should be done by staff who are full time employees; how much should be – use part time; how much of it should be done by outside firms?And this is something that I hope that all parties can work together on it and come up with solutions that protect staff positions where possible and wherever we can employ our staff to do the job in an efficient manner makes sense.That is just the short version of an overview of what I see coming up.But I glad that it's being looked at.
My other comment just briefly:I here there is a plan to close Market Street from 6thStreet down &Am I wrong on that Director?
Director Rahaim:
A plan to close it to normal traffic&There is a concept being proposed to close it to normal traffic but leave it open to buses and &[A trial actually & ]
Commissioner Antonini:
I guess I mis-spoke.I guess it is to auto traffic.My only comment isone who uses that route, I don't see many autos on that section anyway but I think maybe an intermediary step might be to close off right turns and not allow people just to go directly from Van Ness to the Ferry Building knowing that they can't get off of there.I'm just wondering what the affects will be on the other streets when you move the traffic off of there, but I guess we'll find out when we have this closure.I understand it's a trial closure, is that correct?
Director Rahaim:
Yes, a trial for six weeks.The idea is to test it out.
Commissioner Sugaya:
Yes.I had one item, but as long as some other subjects have come up – the whole issue with MEA and environmental review – We're in the business of consulting with firms that do environmental reports and I think the present system with a lot of MEA oversight is one that seems to work, but I understand that there's concerns over delays and whatnot.But turning environmental review over to a consultant hired by the developer is in my opinion is exactly the wrong thing to do.There would have to continue to be a lot of MEA oversight.The simplest solution is, in my opinion and which other cities have done but this city seems to have some huge barrier in the way, is to have the city hire the consultant and have the developer pay for it.I just can't understand why that system, simple as it sounds, can't be implemented here in San Francisco.
Market Street – I've never run into Mr. Antonini on Market but I use it mainly on the weekends when I transport my better half around downtown San Francisco.Maybe because it's the weekend, this whole idea that it is notoriously congested is beyond me.Maybe on the week days it's worse, but that's just an observation.
Lastly, what I was really going to talk about was I did attend last night the first Japantown community meeting that took place after the Commission voted to not endorse but to acknowledge all the work that went into the Japantown Better Neighborhoods Plan over the last several years.At that meeting last night I think there was a re-cap of the events that took place over the years.Generally I think people felt good about at least the attempt at making an open process work as much as possible.There was a panel of three people who gave their opinions.And those people were involved in the very beginning of the planning process and then made some observations about how they felt the process went slightly array toward the end. I think though that basically people are now ready to begin working on it again.Especially in light of I believe Director Rahaim has included a half time request to the Board of Supervisors to fund a position to aid in the process over the next year of so.If the Board agrees, I think the neighborhood is quite willing to move ahead as fast as possible.I also saw a memorandum that I hadn't seen before from David Alumbaugh to staff outlining some various kinds of activities and steps that could take place during this planning process – the next iteration of the planning process.I think the neighborhood is going to take a serious look at that and perhaps try to have a meeting with Director Rahaim and staff over 1) exactly how this position is going to work; and 2) the kind of interaction that they would like to have take place between the neighborhood and community and the Planning Department.It was an encouraging meeting.
Commissioner Olague:
Getting back to my earlier comments on the MEA issue, I agree with what Commissioner Sugaya said completely and I guess that's what alarmed me most when I read the article in the Examiner was the idea of the developer hiring the consultant directly to review their projects.It just seemed a little bit like &
Director Rahaim:
If I could just clarify because there is a lot of confusion about this – the proposal is not for the developer to hire.The proposal if for the developer to pay for &  - the idea is that the Department would hire the consultant and manage the contract for this particular body of work that we're talking about.But I will also say that this has become a personnel issue and a larger issue that I think is not necessarily appropriate to discuss at this table but I'm happy to talk to the commissioners about it.
Commissioner Olague:
The process question; I agree with the process issue that Commissioner Sugaya addressed and I think somebody mentioned that it was kind of like the fox guarding the hen house and I agree with that point.But yeah you're right, the contracting out issue is something that is more personnel and should probably be discussed through memo or elsewhere.
Commissioner Lee:
I wasn't going to talk about the MEA issue, but from a commission perspective I think I'd like Director Rahaim to make sure that the Human Resources Department is on board.As a Commission we cannot interfere with day-to-day activities.What the Director wants to do regarding contracting out, depending on the approval process and I think it's a little premature to discuss it.I don't know if everything in the newspaper article is correct or not, but I did receive a letter from Local 21 earlier this week and they raised a couple of issues of it, but I think it would be better if we had something in writing as far as the Director can go because it is some personnel matters.It's also union negotiations with the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Local 21.There are a lot of issues that play into this MEA.I would caution the Commission and let the Department Head decide what is sent to us.I want to make sure we [don't] step into personnel issues where [with] Local 21 and City and MOU issues.
Commissioner Moore:
I want to ask Director Rahaim does the Department keep a running calendar of what meetings are happening and where?I was unaware of the Japantown meeting.I am also curious when the next Embarcadero meeting is.Is it possible we get copied on that?We might, on an individual basis, decide to attend these meetings and for me personally it would be very helpful not to catch these dates on the run, but really know what your scheduled meetings are.These are primarily neighborhood meetings.
Director Rahaim:
There are two answers.Some of the meeting that were being talked about were neighborhood community meetings that we were attending, but others are in fact meetings that we are sponsoring.Those appear on our website, but they are under the project title and it's hard to find.We are trying to organize a calendar so we can show all the meetings that we are sponsoring in one place.We are not quite there yet, but that is one of the things we are trying to work on.
Commissioner Moore:
I would strongly encourage that that happen soon.There are lots of important things which we mostly only hear about last minute and I would personally like to schedule them into my own calendar as best [fast] as I can.It would be helpful to get that underway as quick as possible.
Commissioner Miguel:
I have to agree with that.I had a conflict so did not get to the Japantown meeting last night, although I did get a couple of email notifications regarding it.
During the last week I met with people regarding the medical cannabis dispensary that we just went through; an item regarding 44thAvenue; one on Washington Street; one on Corbett.Just before I came to the meeting, I took a look at the installation that is going on at 16thand 8thStreets.It's sort of in the middle of [] cafÃ©.They are I would say about three quarters finished with it.It should be open by the end of the week.It's taking the stub end of a non-street in between two very active breakfast lunch places; a half block from the California College of Arts, not the Academy, and it looks like its going to be a nice little mini instillation.It's quite small, but it's going to work.It is not going to infringe on traffic or anything else.They seem to be doing a pretty good job with next to no expense.I know its costing money, but they are really doing a great job with it.
I certainly agree with Commissioner Moore regarding the Academy of Art.To me that was part of their normal PR output and I did not consider it anything that gave me information as to the information that we really requested from them whatsoever.
I also appreciated the material from the Mayor's Office of Economic Development that came.I thought that was extremely well done.And I appreciate Director Rahaim's comments on MEA because there is a great deal of partial information coming from a number of sources and nothing that ties the whole thing together.It is hard to make sense because you don't know when you have the full picture when you get information in that manner.I realize that is a union negotiation issue.It's a personnel matter and we are not necessarily going to have a full hearing on it, but I think a little more information would be helpful.
Commissioner Antonini:
In that same sense I just wanted to report that I have met a few weeks ago with project sponsors – I think its 875 Corbett, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but it's the Corbett case that is coming up nest week.Also with the project sponsor for 750 2ndStreet and I had a phone conversation that I initiated with project sponsor for 673-675 44thAvenue.
5.Director's Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Good afternoon again.Just a couple or announcements on my activities:Last night I made a few comments at a meeting that SPUR had.They're interested in kind of just keeping up to date on what the Department activities are.I forgot to mention two weeks ago I actually did a tour with the Miraloma Park Neighborhood Association.While I'm on that topic it would be for the public's benefit and Commission's benefit, I do very much enjoy those so I would welcome any invitation to meet with the neighborhood group and attend and get a tour of their neighborhood from their perspective which I find extremely useful in getting to know the city better and getting to know the particular issues that are facing those neighborhoods.
I wanted to also mention the Pavement to Parks Program that President Miguel raised.Staff has been very heavily engaged in those; particularly Andres Power on the staff has been kind of the Project Manager for those.They are using found materials for the most part that DPW has on site – former sewer pipes and things to plant.And actually it was a staff volunteer effort that went out and planted many of the plants and that was at both the 16thand 8thStreet location and at Potrero as well as the San Jose and Guerrero location.Both of those are set to open I think this weekend.
Finally, I just want to let you know that I will be taking some time off in early October.I will miss the first two meetings of the month.I will be out from the 1stto the 13th –partially on a speaking trip to MontrÃ©al and then for some vacation in New England during the fall season.So I will miss the first two meetings of October.
6.Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.

BOARD OF APPEALS:
Commissioner Antonini:
I just wanted to comment and thank Mr. Badiner and DBI for working on making sure that where there are violations or work done in excess of permits – I think it does happen fairly frequently and I'm glad that we are trying to find where can where this is happening.
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
Thank you.I should have said that the Board of Appeals complemented the Department, Enforcement and Neighborhood Planning staff Kate Conner and Elizabeth Watty for their diligent work on this.It is both their efforts that really brought this to fruition.
