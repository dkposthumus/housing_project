5.Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Antonini:
I want to thank Peter Albert from SFMTA and Tiffany Bohi from the Mayor's Office of Economic Development who met with me last Thursday and talked a little bit about some of the infrastructure plans for south eastern San Francisco.I think contrary to some of the talk that is going about, there are significant and substantial plans in the works for that area to help some of the transportation problems that exist in a situation where you have a couple of peninsulas that come off of a peninsula and would allow development in that area.I was quite impressed with the plans they had and I think this will be the subject of hearings we're having in the near future.They have taken into consideration bicycles and pedestrians as well as lightrail and automotive transport to these areas.I think it is very encouraging the thought that has gone into it.It still has a ways to go, but I think you are going to very happy to hear some of the ideas they are bringing forward.
Commissioner Moore:
I would like to commend the Planning Department – Mr. Badiner, Mr. Sider – everybody who pursued the large illegal signage discussion we had on 310 Grant Street.It shocked me walking down Grant and Sutter.I called Mr. Badiner and he informed me that there was already action on fining the installation of the shrink wrap.A week or two later the shrink wrap was down at the tune of $2,300 a day I think.In the course of that, Mr. Badiner forwarded to me and probably to all commissioners a discussion of the building at the corner of Powell and Post.I'm not quite sure if this matter was resolved, but I'd like Mr. Badiner to explain it to us.
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
We are seeing over the last couple of months an innovative approach in reaching the public.We have a lot of vacant buildings downtown and we are seeing companies come forward, and as Commissioner Moore has said, shrink wrapping a building.It was brought to my attention this morning that the old S&C Ford building at Market and Deloris Street has been wrapped over the weekend – and this I don't think is a wrap, I think it is a paint – for levis.They are no longer getting in the retail and frame it where the windows used to be and then there was the solid portion and you would put a sign maybe in the window.No, now you go over the column, you wrap it all the way around and you continue it along.On the one hand we might not have a vacant building or storefront that is ratty; on the other hand we are getting what is general advertising.We do not find that that meets the provision of the Planning Code.We are looking at these very strictly.I'm also finding interestingly enough, that it's quite often on projects that are coming in for entitlements.And maybe I will put it on record:You may not have a public hearing on an entitlement if you have a violation on your property.So get those wraps down.Also, although I have not discussed this with the Director, it would not be my personal priority to be reviewing a permit if there is a violation on it – even though we can review a permit, we just can't approve it.It's becoming somewhat problematic.What I forwarded only to you commissioner was the response on one of them that was so laughable –  it's not general advertising.We were drawing attention to local businesses in the area.'If that isn't the definition of general advertising, I don't know what it is.
Commissioner Miguel:
Thank you Mr. Badiner.As you know my personal thoughts on anyone doing any business with the Commission or with the Department when they have violations pending to me is a no-no.
Commissioner Olague:
This week in the paper, John King had an article about what to do with those lots where there is a delay in the development.It might be interesting, I would think, if we had a hearing here and maybe invite Mr. King and discuss with members of the public some creative ideas.I thought Friends of the Urban Forest and others had some pretty interesting thoughts on what to do with those lots that are now sitting there under utilized.I know that the Mayor had in the paper this week, or maybe it was a press release, had some ideas around food and food policy in the city.I don't know if there are ways that they cover some best practices in other cities, but I think that we need to have a hearing and a real discussion about that issue.
Commissioner Borden:
I second that.She took what I was going to say.
Commissioner Antonini:
[He made a request to staff regarding the signage issue]:on buildings that are in dis-repair, I think that particularly on a project we approved some years ago (I don't have the street address) at Sutter and Taylor, the south east corner, and nothing has been done.The building is graffiti(ed) and not kept up and it would seem if we are policing for advertising signs on buildings that are vacant, we also should be very cognizant of buildings that are not maintained properly and make sure the owners maintain that building until such time as the new tenant comes in or the building is torn down or remodeled or whatever happens.
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
I will follow up on that
Commissioner Sugaya:
There have been times when the public, and sometimes commissioners I suppose, get frustrated with the way our meetings happen to be running.However I had occasion as a consultant to attend two public hearings in another community.I must say that the meetings here are run very well.The first meeting was canceled but they had the meeting anyway – not to take action, but to explain to the public why the meeting was canceled – which everybody already knew why it was canceled but they had it anyway which then erupted into this tirade from the members of the public who happened to be there venting their frustration.That did not seem to go very well in my opinion.The second meeting which was on the same subject – I was expecting a little more fireworks, but it was a bit more subdued.But I must say that in comparison, our meetings are run very well.
Commissioner Moore:
In quick response to Commissioner Antonini's comments which I think are very important, my understanding is that Supervisor Chiu's blight ordinance will address it in some form or another and I hope that we will have the time to look at that again and comment at the appropriate time.
Commissioner Miguel:
I want to mention that I met with and did a tour with people from the Exploratorium.I've been interfacing with the Housing Action Coalition as to their take on Mission Street heights.I want to take note that the letter that came out of this Commission regarding the Fisher family proposals for the museum in the main post of the Presidio was in line to the extent with what has happened so far on that one.I actually have been speaking with John King regarding his article and who knows, that's something for September 3rd.
Director Rahaim:
On that last item on the empty lots, since I was quoted in that article, I have gotten a number of interesting emails about suggestions for empty lots.One of the important things to remember is that these are privately owned properties so access to the lots is probably not possible.But certainly having them more visually appealing and having them as venues for different types of art work or plantings or whatever is certainly possible.There are some organizations out there that emailed me that had some suggestions about how they could be involved.We'll be looking into that a little bit.Secondly, I did want to mention the Mayor's food policy Executive Order that came out this week.We are involved in that.I attended a meeting just before this meeting with other department directors on things that we can do on that.I'm personally interested in this topic and have been for a while.I think there is a lot we can do in the Department and as a city to better connect the city to its food sources and to even encourage food production within the city limits.So we will be working on that and sitting on the Food Policy Council as a way of encouraging the Department to be more engaged and encourage food production activities and connections to our sources of food in the region.
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
A couple of items that I wanted to bring to your attention:A couple of weeks ago there was a request that you hold a hearing and have a policy on requiring 311 notice in the RTO districts outside of West SOMA.In conversation with the President of the Commission, we both felt that it was much easier if I issue a Bulletin.I have issued that Bulletin.It is in your packets for next week.It is dated today and will require Section 311 notices in RTO districts in West SOMA.Let me remind you that we are doing a universal Planning notice project.There is actually a meeting this evening at I believe 7:00 at the Planning Department.That is a public meeting for us to discuss our initial proposals.We will be having a hearing in front of the Planning Commission – the first of a number of hearing, we don't want action – in the middle of August to discuss this.Obviously as we go through the notices, as we have these public meetings, we are discovering some of the problems we have with noticing.We would hope to correct those to the UPN process as much as possible.I think this is an exception to that and it made some sense to issue a Bulletin, but I don't intend that every time we discover a tweak or a problem to correct it individually,I hope that as we go forward that we correct it through the process, the UPN process.I think it makes more sense.It is the whole reason why we are doing the UPN process.The other point I wanted to make was the Health Department's report on CPMC's Institutional Master Plan has been transmitted to the Department from the Department of Public Health.We have hard copies in your packets along with a letter from Health Director Mitch Katz.This will also be posted on our web site shortly, if not already up, in the next couple of days so it should be readily available for anyone who wants it.I believe the Institutional Master Plan is tentatively scheduled for the September 17thPlanning Commission hearing.
7.Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS REPORT (this report followed item 15):
Land Use Committee –Canceled
Full Board:
BOARD OF APPEALS REPORT:
The Board had a case on Folsom Street that had not been before you.It is interesting in that it is a non-conforming use.As the Commission knows, a non-conforming use is a use that was legal at one time and the zoning changed so they are no longer a permitted use.Those uses are allowed to continue except if they are abandoned.We had this case that seemed to have been abandoned over a long period of time.It was clearly a storefront type of use.We struggle with these because there is not a lot of other uses for storefronts.We now think that having storefronts in residential neighborhoods are a good idea.This was a non-conforming use I believe in a RH-3.We had some fairly adequate information that it had been abandoned; not withstanding the fact that we felt potentially it could have been a good use.The Board of Appeals in their wisdom felt that we hadn't provided adequate notice for the abandonment and allowed the non-conforming use to remain.I believe the use they want to put in there would still be considered a conditional use and it might be coming before you for action.I believe it is2500 Folsom.It is something we struggle with where you have a building that is clearly a ground floor commercial in nature but the non-conforming has been abandoned.In an ideal world we would reexamine our non-conforming rules where we no longer believe that retail should never mix with residential and if they do, we want to get rid of them.That is the classic planning theory.It no longer applies, but we still do have code provisions like that.So we certainly believe the Board of Appeals did the right emotional thing in this case and served justice.
