C.COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
10.Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Antonini:
He expressed that the two things we (the commission) has the most discussion on are preservation and rent control, or things related to them.One of the concerns is that we have a large stock of older homes with various needs (seismic, soft-story, plumbing, electrical, dry rot, etc.) and the renovations are expensive.The concept came to mind that there would some kind of a system whereby an owner or builder of a newer unit could trade that unit for older units.The older units would then not be under rent control.The newer units would then be under rent control.There would have to be a lot of protections for those renters that are in these units to make sure they were still under rent control.One of the benefits, other than the fact there would be more incentive to invest into the units because you could afford to do it because your rents could be raised, is the fact that there might be less of a tendency to move out of rental tenancy into home ownership tenancy because now there are great pressures on owners.They buy buildings and you can't possibly rent them for enough so there is a tendency to want to try to convert them into a different tenancy.I think it's a concept to think about and explore because we have such a need for these older structures to be renovated and there are a lot of things the newer structures lend themselves more to families.You have more bathrooms; you have better room plans; the plumbing and electrical systems are better; and by its nature you would not have to increase the rents as much because presumably these buildings have been built to the seismic qualifications and other qualifications that we have today and there would be less need to increase rents.It would be a voluntary program and I throw it out for the commissioners and other to think about.
Commissioner Borden:
I just want to ask staff on record about the Metro Theatre because that was an item that was supposed to be coming before the Commission next week and it is my understand that it is no longer coming before the Planning Commission and it's going before the Historic Preservation Commission.
Commissioner Miguel responded:
I discussed this earlier with the City Attorney and would appreciate it if they would give all of us that interpretation.
Deputy City Attorney Marlena Byrne responded:
As you all are aware on the November ballet this past fall the voters approved Proposition J which created a new Charter section – Section 4.135 – creating the new Historic Preservation Commission.That Charter Section specifically states under the sub-paragraph entitled Landmarks andHistoric Districts I believe is the title, that the Historic Preservation Commission shall make recommendations regarding approval, disapproval or modification of individual landmarks directly to the Board of Supervisors without referral or recommendation of the Planning Commission.So essentially, the Planning Commission no longer has jurisdiction to give a recommendation to the Board of Supervisors about individual landmarks.For Historic Districts it is slightly different.The Charter Amendment does state that the Historic Preservation Commission's recommendations on Historic Districts should be referred to the Planning Commission for their input and then that input would be sent to the Board of Supervisors along with Historic Preservation Commission's recommendation.But because the proposed landmarking of the Metro Theatre is just for an individual landmark building, it is no longer within the Planning Commission's jurisdiction.
Commissioner Borden:
I do have a question.It is my understanding that the Metro Theatre was already heard before the old Landmarks Board.I know that is a different body now, but I am just wondering about that process and will we have other projects that having been heard previously by the Landmarks Board that now have to have a second hearing again before the Historic Preservation Commission.
Deputy City Attorney Marlena Byrne responded:
The Metro Theatre was sort of caught in between the two processes and had its first hearing before the former Landmarks Board back in December when that body still existed.Subsequent to that the new Charter section went into effect.Under the law the new procedures are applied to projects of applications that have not completed their approval process.The new procedures of having it go before the Historic Preservation Commission are required.It actually doesn't create a new hearing because under the old procedures it still would have had to come before this body.So it's a different body they are appearing in front of but it is the same number of hearings that they would have had under the old system.
Commissioner Borden:
Do we have any knowledge about how many projects approximately might fall into that category?
Tara Sullivan-Lenane of Department Staff responded:
We have analyzed, once this came up about the Metro Theatre, to see if there were any other projects in the pipeline that were subject to this and the Department doesn't believe that there are.There is a Planning Code change for Article 10 – The Bush Street Cottage Row Historic District – which was heard by the Landmarks Board as well as the Planning Commission.It was pending at Land Use for most of the fall.So that has actually been re-referred back to us and is subject to the same controls that Deputy City Attorney Byrne mentioned.It has come back to the Planning Department.It has to be heard by the Preservation Commission and then again by you one more time.That is another piece of a code change that is in limbo, but in terms of specific projects, it is only the Metro Theatre that has been caught in this.
Commissioner Borden:
So assuming whatever happens in that process, when they would come with a real project that would still come to us, correct?
Tara Sullivan-Lenane responded:
For the Metro Theatre?Presuming that theatre gets landmarked as an individual landmark under Article 10, it would need a Certificate of Appropriateness that would go the Historic Preservation Commission.It would also likely need a Conditional Use that would come in front of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Borden:
If it doesn't need a Conditional Use for the uses they put in there then we won't see it.
Tara Sullivan-Lenane:
Exactly.
Commissioner Sugaya:
There was an article in the Chronicle's Sports section that said that Bill Lee actually tried out for the Giants in 1985 and goes on to elaborate.I just want to acknowledge Commissioner Lee as a former baseball player.
Commissioner Lee (in the background):
It was the Boston Red Socks
Commissioner Antonini:
To the City Attorney:Does Prop J have definite language that speaks to projects that are not completed or is your opinion more of an interpretation?
Deputy City Attorney Marlena Byrne responded:
It doesn't specifically call out projects that are not completed
Commissioner Antonini:
What is the basis of your opinion on that then?
Deputy City Attorney Marlena Byrne responded:
On which?On the Metro Theatre?
Commissioner Antonini:
On the fact that it's in transit.It sort of started but not completed.So one could interpret it that since its already been started it should just precede through the channels that existed at the time it began as opposed having to go through the new &
Deputy City Attorney Marlena Byrne responded:
I'm sure the Zoning Administrator could also speak to this, but for any project of any kind, if it hasn't gotten the permit or in this case had a final hearing on its landmarking, if it's still going through the process, new processes apply to that.This comes up frequently in the context of permitting.Unless there is a specific exemption in the new legislation that grandfathers existing applications, applications that have not been completed are always subject to new processes.
Commissioner Antonini:
My follow up question is does there need to be a full Preservation Commission in place before action can be taken or can they take action with less than a full complement of commissioners?
Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:
It is my understanding that there are four commissioners.That constitutes a quorum.They need a unanimous opinion because they need a majority of the full complement because they only have four of the seven to make a decision.But they can make decisions as long as they all agree, which in San Francisco is common.
Commissioner Olague:
I have some questions about the CAC for the Eastern Neighborhoods and when that is going to be established.
Director Rahaim responded:
Commissioner, the letter went to the Board and to the Mayor asking that they appoint their members.We sent that out about two weeks ago.We are waiting to hear back.There are a total of about nine or eleven, I can't quite remember the exact number.
Commissioner Olague:
When is the Mission Street rezoning going to happen?
Director Rahaim responded:
The Board legislation directing us to do that work asked us to bring something back for their consideration within six months from the effective date of the Plan.The Plan was effective at the end of January and staff is already working on that.We believe we can meet their schedule and get something to this Commission and to the Board in June or July.
Commissioner Olague:
I'm kind of hoping that the CAC is established so they can weigh in.I think that is critical.
Director Rahaim responded:
We are doing our best to make that happen.
Commissioner Olague:
What would fall under the jurisdiction of the Historic Preservation Commission vs this commission in the Eastern Neighborhoods?I want an understanding of what types of development would be heard by us.And also, I don't believe that any members of the affordable housing development community or community based organizations that do advocacy work around community based planning were apart of those drafting the Prop J legislation.I want to make sure that as we enter into the discussions of Articles 10 and 11 that the Planning Department convene a meeting with community based organizations and affordable housing developers so they can have a clear understanding of how the criteria that they would have to meet that is being established by this new commission might affect/impact the projects that they might be proposing.I think that is important that that take place.Also, when it comes to advocacy work that will have an impact I think on the type of projects they can advocate on and how they would advocate.I think that is a community in the city that needs to have a better understanding of this.Also, healthy development measurement tool is something that came up a lot during the Eastern Neighborhoods Community Health Impact Assessment work.I would like to have a better understanding of how the Department is going to be applying it to projects.I would like an update.I know that DPH spent a lot of time and effort and money developing it.
Director Rahaim responded:
Why don't I ask staff to prepare a memo on that?There was some form of the healthy development measurement tool that was incorporated into the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan.But we are happy to let you know how that is working.
Commissioner Olague:
Finally, last week, I believe it was someone who was speaking about the project for formerly homeless individuals in the Haight- I was wondering is there any mechanism for selecting people from a specific zip code when it comes to affordable housing projects.Maybe I could get some information from the Mayor's Office of Housing about it.They had asked if there was a way of prioritizing it.
Craig Idelman, Mayor's Office of Housing responded:
Traditionally, Redevelopment law allows for some more specific targeting of a geographic nature for housing but our sources generally at the Mayor's Office of Housing that don't fall under the California Redevelopment law requirements do not.And actually fair housing and other restrictions on our dollars specifically prohibit that kind of targeting.
Commissioner Olague:
There were formerly homeless individuals that were going to be placed into this one project.
Craig Idelman responded:
I think what we often times what we try and do is address that through affirmative marketing plans so that while we are not creating a specific geographic preference, what we are doing is affirmatively marketing to areas that we think are most in need.
Commissioner Lee:
Before you go, what is the definition of affirmative marketing?
Craig Idelman responded:
I don't know that I have a legal definition.The intention of affirmative marketing is making sure that there is much awareness of the availability of housing, and affordable housing in particular, to the San Francisco public as possible.
Commissioner Lee:
So if you advertise in just that area is that considered legal or illegal?
Craig Idelman responded:
I can't give you a legal definition.We have minimum standards that we adhere to.Every development we fund and work on requires an affirmative marketing plan and we have staff persons that review that for conformance with both legal requirements and our funding regulations.
Commissioner Lee:
My question is if someone say in the Mission or the Bayview wanted to move to the Haight, if you have affirmative marketing, how would those different ethnicity groups know there is availability for this type of housing say in the Haight?
Craig Idelman responded:
We have an array of outreach efforts.Some of them are city wide and some of them are working with specific community groups on targeted populations, for instance, homeless populations in this case where we know there is a concentrated need.So geographically we are not specifically targeting areas but often working with community based organizations and project sponsors.
Commissioner Sugaya:
Something Commissioner Olague said prompted me to ask this question and that is the Eastern Neighborhoods CAC is similar I assume to the Market Octavia CAC in what its roles and responsibilities are; so therefore they are not really project oriented
Commissioner Olague:
No but the rezoning of Mission Street isn't project oriented either per say, right?
Commissioner Sugaya:
But aren't they limited to looking at the community benefits program?
Director Rahaim responded:
Their primary is not to look at projects or zoning specifically, but to look at community benefits and how impact fee monies are proposed to be spent and to look at over time how the plan is doing; to Kind of do an on-going stewardship of the plan itself.We have to look at the specific language to know if they should formally weigh in on Mission Street height analysis.
Commissioner Olague:
It seems to me that stewardship would fall under that category.
Director Rahaim:
Perhaps
Commissioner Olague:
I would like a definite answer to that because I think it's critical.
Commissioner Miguel:
I want to mention that I had the pleasure of going on a SPUR tour of mosaic housing this week at 19thand Alabama.It is interesting because it is a massive project, a full large square block with public mid-block access, PDR already going in on the ground floor, rental and home ownership, BMR and market-rate all combined into one project and it looks like it was combined well.I also want to comment that this Tuesday in the Chronicle, John King's article on Working for More Affordable Housing I felt was done in his usual good style.I attended a meeting of the Japantown Better Neighborhoods group which meets on a regular basis and has for some time.Rosie Dudley from the Department does an excellent job running that group.I just wanted to get up to date in my mind on what's happening there as I did last night with at the meeting of the Taylor Street Revitalization Plan.There is a lot of things happening there – the 180 Jones street project, the TNDC project on Taylor that is not quite as far along.I have also met with some people on 1650 Broadway which is slowly coming around to us.Just so the Commission knows, I do not intend to do this very often, and that is ask for continuances.I don't like continuances.I like to try to have things settled, or at least come to some fruition as early as possible.But on 100 32ndAvenue, I worked with Glenn Cabreros who has arranged for a joint meeting with all parties and I think we are real close and my hope is we won't have to hear it.But that is not something I intend to do on a regular basis.
11.Director's Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Good afternoon everyone.We did submit a balanced budget to the Mayor's Office last Friday.I just want to thank you again for your support of that budget last week.We will keep you informed as to the details as we move forward and to whether there will be any changes in the coming months, which there likely will be, but we don't know what those are at this point.I wanted to let you know that on the Bike Plan EIR we are working with the MTA very closely on that project.We are working on the comments and responses and we expect to be able to get that to you for final certification by the end of June, which I think meets a commitment that we made that happen in that time frame.And finally, you may have heard that I attended a Port Commission meeting on Tuesday evening related to the Northeast Waterfront.Supervisor Chiu as formally requested that the Port look at more closely the sites that they control along the Northeast Waterfront, along the Embarcadero, and the Port has asked us to do an urban design public realm study of that part of the Embarcadero, similar to what we did on the upper Market study.We have agreed to do that.We have been talking to the Port staff about budget and scope for that right now, but we do expect that we will be starting that very quickly and hope that we will complete by the middle of fall.The idea is to work with constituents in that part of the city, neighbors, and the community to look at specific design guidelines for the Port owned properties and to look at potential public realm improvements in that part of the Embarcadero.So we will be working closely with the Port over the next few months and we will brief you on that in the coming months as well.
