4.Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Antonini:
I have a couple of comments.One is the result of the news of some tragic fires that occurred while we were on our break.And while I haven't talked to the Fire Department on these, often times there is the usual causes like smoking or perhaps some illegal drug manufacturing, but many times its overloaded electrical and too much garbage accumulating.Unfortunately sometimes these are the result of too many units and too many people and too little space.I expressed an idea some months ago and I'd like to ask the planning staff to comment on it (not today, but to look into it), but it is an idea.As we know, these 100 year old units are very expensive to restore.A huge percentage of these are under rent control and other restrictions that make it difficult for an owner to perhaps make the restorations in a way that can upgrade the safety features and everything.My concept was a trade where – and this would be something that would have to be initiated administratively, probably at the Board of Supervisors, but certainly the idea where an owner could take post 1976 units and put those under rent control and [other] controls and thereby eliminate some of the controls on the older units to be able to realize enough from the units to be able to make these improvements that would make them larger for families; upgrade the electrical systems; a lot of things that are extremely expensive when you've got older units.It's just a concept that I had and certainly I think the city would still have the same number of units that would be protected but the protections would be on the newer units which are ones that you can probably afford to put less maintenance into because they are newer units and some would be traded for units that take these costs.It's just something I'd like to throw out there as an idea for the future.
My other comment has to do with – I happened to dig up a copy ofCalifornia Historyand it had an article in the early edition of 2008 about Allister McKenzy and Robert Hunter who were famous golf course architects.They designed some very famous courses in California, inspired initially by Lincoln Park, which they didn't do – it pre dated them.They did things like Cyprus Point, which is the most famous, & , and one of them is Sharp Park, which has come under some question lately because of a problem that some people have found dealing with some endangered species.Among all these courses that they designed, only Sharp Park and Northwood Golf Course up at Russian River are the only courses that the average golfer can afford to play on because the others are either private clubs or very expensive.I actually called the Planning Director in Pacifica because I think there is some jurisdictional issues here and he kind of said off the record [he affirmed what I thought from having played golf and being familiar with this for many years] that we have a co-existence going on.In fact in the  80s there was a reconfiguration of some of the holes because of the result of very heavy rain years where some water came in and they sort of had to move the course a little bit away from the coast.I think some of these problems have already been addressed.I hope we can find a way to historically landmark the course with all 18 holes.They have already done so with their club house.It was originally built in 1932.Figure out a way even if it means locating one of the holes or something on the hillside where three of them now exist – there is a way to keep that course in place because I think it's one of the things that we as San Franciscans treasure and we certainly appreciate the work of our ancestors over the last 150 years to create one of the worlds most beautiful cities and out lying areas on what was previously a barren, windy, sandy and often cold and foggy peninsula.I think we have to tread lightly when we start thinking about tearing out things that are historical.
Commissioner Moore:
On Tuesday the AIA sponsored Architecture and the City Festival [she held up a pamphlet].For anybody who wants to take a look at it, I think it is a treasure trove for anybody who is interested in architecture and the subtleties of what is going on behind the scenes should look at this program or visit their web site at AIASF/ARCINTHECITY.This thing is going on through September 30thand there is something for everybody.It is really quite good and I encourage everybody to look at it.
On a slightly more sober note:The other day there was an article in the New York Times that very clearly summarized that some buildings are not living up to their green label.I found that article rather disturbing.Aside from LEED certification, which is really honoring an architect's intent to build a green building, between construction and building performance there is a significant breakdown of what really ultimately warrants a green recognition for a building.The energy performance of about 53 of those buildings is not even meeting green star standards.LEED is considering revising the rating system and I just want to put us on notice that just for an architect to design a green building is not necessarily a reason to award a building more exemptions or special consideration.The devil is in the details and that is when a building is built and is performing.I just want to pass that article around and have everybody else draw their own conclusions.
Commissioner Lee:
The latest unemployment rate for San Francisco is 9.9%.I know the city itself, the Planning Department issues every year our employment status.What I'd like to find out from the staff if we can get it, is where is our unemployment broken down?Is it mostly financial, or is it mostly the trades here, is it Local 2?That is important for us because I think we've got to start looking at if the downturn in the economy continues for another year or two years we could have as many as 50% of our carpenters out of work.Having said that, I want to follow up on my request regarding Oz Erickson who at a conference that some of the commissioners attended made a statement that each unit downtown that's being built for a condo, that $80,000 of it goes to the city.And I think I've asked staff to ask Mr. Erickson to come here to testify to that.What I'd like to have is the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, SPUR, the Labor Council, the Trades actually come here and tell us what should we be doing in anticipation of an even larger downturn in the next year given that we know four or five pieces of property that have been sold that have gone bankrupt – hotels and commercial properties – which will affect our tax base which will mean from what I hear from Sacramento that statewide the assessment of property tax of property will be going down which will affect us.I'd like to have the other commissioners agree that we should invite some of these organizations, especially labor, since they have a lot in layoff, and then ask the Chamber and SPUR and the City's economist to come here and give us a break down in the type of unemployment we have.Is it mostly at the lower end, middle or upper end?Talk to the Convention and Visitor's Bureau to figure out how many people that work in the hotels don't have jobs.And then the trades are very important because they are very well paid but they have quite a few laid off now.I think we need as a Planning Commission to know and let the rest of the people in the city know that we are trying to address the issue.
Regarding the LEED issue that Commissioner Moore did bring up:We do know that doing the higher level, the platinum level, is very expensive.I think, and this is where I disagree with Commissioner Moore, I don't know which level we are going to look at but if someone is welling to spend the extra money then I think we should support that.I think the Solar SF program we have in the city where we have 2,000 buildings that have solar panels is very expensive but the city subsidizes that by 10% depending if hiring people who are unemployed.The federal government gives you tax credits and so does the state.So regarding some of the LEED standards I think the city should take a look at it and say let's encourage people for the future.Whether you get platinum or gold or just certified, I think that is something we should take a look at.
Commissioner Antonini:
I just wanted to agree with Commissioner Lee.I think that is a good suggestion.I think I'd heard that the hotel occupancy rates were fairly good but they've had to drop the room rates quite a bit to be able to do that.And I also would agree with Commissioner Moore and perhaps there is a way we could have information from planning staff as to what kind of checks do we have on people as far as whether they actually deliver on their LEED claims and stuff in the future and how we could monitor that.
Commissioner Miguel:
I was in New York for the last couple of weeks and talked to a number of people regarding the New York Times article.What they were telling me was that it was not so much the architects and the construction but it was the operation of the buildings.It's somewhat akin to what happens in areas like recreation and parks where you put a great park together but you have no maintenance.So five years down the line everyone is complaining that the place doesn't work.Of course it doesn't work.There is a big fall off between the actual LEED and the operation of it which has a totally different, if any, standard to it unfortunately.But I think you have to take that into consideration.It is an important question.I appreciate the fact that LEED is going to at least review the way they handle things and the possibility, at least the article inferred, that the rating would not be certified until after a year or so of actual operation.
Also, for those of you who have been in New York recently, I hope that you have been to the High Line, which is the old industrial railroad tracks on the west side through the meat packing district that used to bring the cargo in and out of the meat packing district and the other heavy industrial areas.One third, or the first of three sections has been converted to a 30-foot in the air park.One of the most innovative and interesting designs I have yet seen in park space.I think it is extremely well done.It is open from relatively early in the morning until 10 o'clock at night and it's in constant use.They are sort of shooing people out of there at 10 at night, even Monday and Tuesday nights, let alone the weekends.It has totally invigorated the area.One of the reasons I particularly wanted to see it both day and night was not just the design and landscape design and how they are handling it, is when we have talked about the fact of a raised park above our transit center that is in progress, we keep talking about activating it.I have been one of those who have done that.I find it very interesting that at the moment this very active space has three little carts on it – one for gelato, one for coffee and I forget the third one [lemonade] – and they are not always open.That's it.That is the activation and yet it is in constant use.I've started to re-think my concept on this a little bit and if you go onto their website thehighline.org there is a slide show and the design elements on it that I think you will find very interesting.
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
Because staff is so responsive to commissioner's requests, I have already been to the High Line this weekend.I spend a lot of time on the High Lind and it is very interesting and I thought of the same link with the Transbay Terminal.I think there is a critical difference.This is 40 feet wide and it is not a platform you can go on for 40 feet.There is tons of greenery and open space and planting and changes in levels.It is really fascinating.The other interesting thing is that a lot of it is located right now the first segment in the meat packing district.The meat packing district is sort of the hot, hip area of New York.Many of the designers are down there.So when you are walking around down there, you see a very rarefied New Yorker.Go 30 feet up unto the High Line, and you see people that really represent much more New York City I think and a much broader aspect.The change in elevation changes the populace dramatically.It is very interesting and I had an opportunity to talk with one of the design people and we talked about some of the technicalities.They used transferable of development rights like we use transferable development rights.From a bureaucratic process it is very interesting also and I hope to do a little brown bag slide show in the near future on it.I also saw a lot of great urban design architecture that has recently been built.I also saw some very poor architecture by named architects that we won't mention.
Commissioner Miguel:
The other thing that I might mention that I found out and I was able to take a look at three is the closing off of streets or portion of streets to use as park land similar to some of the experimentation that we are currently doing here.There is a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for it.They seem very well used, highly sought after areas.They are improving the retail directly surrounding them and so far they have been very effective.At least to the people I'm talking to and I don't have a lot of contacts back there, there has not been very much opposition even in the original concept of them.They are working.They are really working.
5.Director's Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Good afternoon Commissioners.Welcome back.I hope you've had a good summer break.On Commissioner Miguel's last item – what we call Pavement to Parks – as you know the first one was done at 17th, Market and Castro.It has been a very big success.We have two more under construction right now that will be open in about a week.One is at the corner of 16thand 8thin Potrero Hill and the second is at the intersection of San Jose and Guerrero at 28thStreet.Both of those are literally under construction right now and will be opening I think next week.If I may, I want to give a plug to Andres Power on the staff who has been personally managing those almost the entire process from design to personally buying furniture and planting plants.We actually have organized a volunteer effort where staff can go out and help do the planting of the plants tomorrow.It's kind of a fun project for staff as well as for the city.
Just a couple of comments on my activities:As you know I have been involved with the upcoming ULI convention.I passed out today a memo with the schedule of events.There are several highlighted items that have to do with San Francisco projects.Two of those are being sponsored by the Department.We also are taking advantage of a third session that has been put together by EDAW where five (5) west cost Planning Directors, including myself, will all be in town for a session and what is not on that schedule is that we have tentatively scheduled an event with SPUR for the evening of Wednesday, November 3 where we would bring those same directors together for an event at SPUR.It will be San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland and Vancouver.There are other events there also and you will note in my memo that ULI is offering a scholarship program to public officials on a first come first served basis.So if you are interested, please let us know and we will get our names on the list for that.
Regarding Commissioner Lee's comment:I have asked Mr. Erickson to give us more detailed information about his comments at the Business Times Breakfast meeting regarding impact fees.I've gotten this question a lot over the past few weeks.Staff is looking at those numbers and what I'd like to do is report back to you on our take on the cost of the impact fees.I believe his numbers were based on the numbers associated with One Rincon in which I think would have the highest fee just because of the nature of that project.But we will do a little comparison for you.
Finally, on the LEED item, your comments Commissioner Miguel are exactly what I had learned as well about the actual performance of green buildings.That often a building doesn't perform as expected essentially because of the plug load – everything from people bringing in their own refrigerators and plugging them in to the office to how the mechanical systems are operated.The whole operation of a building is really not something that LEED in and of itself is not set up to deal with and in a way, it can't.But it does suggest that there is a whole educational system that the Green Building Council and others I think are working on with building owners and how buildings are actually operated.The other thing to remind you is that we actually do not give & , there are currently no particular incentives – in fact the recent changes to the city's Building Code will require that buildings above a certain threshold are now LEED Silver and I think in two years most of them will be required to become LEED Gold.That is an out right requirement in the Code right now.From the Department standpoint, we are encouraging people to beyond LEED Gold.There is a Director's bulletin (what we call our Priority Processing) that suggests that we are giving priority processing currently to projects that provide LEED Gold plus 10 points.So [although] not quite LEED Platinum, but [it is] beyond LEED Gold.So people who really want to start pushing the envelope we are encouraging them to do so.
I also want to mention that you have asked for a number of joint hearings with different commission over the past few months and we are trying to organize those.They are logistically a little difficult to organize, more than they should be, but for whatever reason it is hard to get two groups together.But we do have the joint hearing I think as you know on September 17thwith the Health Commission.We are working on joint hearings with the Rec/Park Commission which looks to be in mid November and staff is also working with the Small Business Commission for a joint hearing as well also in the Fall.
Commissioner Lee:
Speaking of New York and San Francisco and the parks, there is a lady that has an office in New York and San Francisco; and she has done work in San Francisco called the Living Library.I don't know if you have seen some of her work.She has got something on Irving Street – 6thor 9th– where she puts everything green, but it also educates the general public.She actually got a UNESCO Award for that.Bonny Sherik is her name.She has been around the city about twenty years.She wanted to develop Civic Center Plaza where not really is it greening but it us educational and has a motif to it.I have been working with her to try to get her to China – she has been there a couple of times – to put in a Living Library to educate the young people of how to green your city, but also to educate the young people and also have edible fruits and she did something on a roof somewhere in New York city that tweaked my interest.What I will do is email you her email address here and in New York and maybe if you want to talk to her about the next wave of greening she would be the appropriate person to talk to.
