8. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
BOS -
In addition to the budget proceedings at the Board, the following occurred:
Board of Supervisors Hearing of June 24, 2003:
O'Shaughnessy Dam Negative Declaration Appeal:
The Board unanimously upheld the Commission's certification of the Negative Declaration appeal, but only after they adopted a resolution sponsored by Supervisor Ammiano and agreed to by the PUC to specify that the project correspond to that which was analyzed by the Negative Declaration and no more. This effectively restricts the PUC from discharging any additional water from the dam beyond what was analyzed in our Negative Declaration.
Other appeals were continued until July 22:
1)40-50 Lansing Street:CU appeal of the 82-unit residential project at 40-50 Lansing St. The appeal has been filed by 5 members of the Board of Supervisors.
2)3725 Buchanan Street:CU appeal of your May 1 decision to authorize a total of 8 Verizon Wireless antennas on 3725 Buchanan that was filed by 20% of surrounding property owners.
New Appeals filed:
19thStreet PG&E Transformer:CU appeal by the appellant, Mr. Todd Curtis, on behalf of the neighborhood group, the Lexington, San Carlos Neighborhood Coalition. There had been a question as to whether the 20% signatures were valid and sufficient, but the discrepancies have now been clarified and the matter has qualified for an appeal hearing. This has also been scheduled for July 22, 2003.
270-284 Valencia Street:This is a project to demolish a one-story former car repair shop structure and construct a four-story, 28 units residential building over 3,533 sf of ground-floor retail and 31 off street parking spaces in the basement.  It was subject to a CU for a change of use per Mission District Interim Controls.  The CU was approved unanimously by this Commission on May 16, 2003, and it had generated no substantial opposition. The appeal has been filed by a next door neighbor of the project and qualified for an appeal with the signature of 5 members of the Board. (Daly, Gonzalez, Maxwell, Ammiano, Dufty), it is scheduled for July 15, 2003 with an addition to the appeal on the secondary unit environmental exemption.
BOA -
Re:  Lingba Lounge - 18thStreet
- When this came before the Commission, your decision was to take Discretionary Review and amend the hours of operation.  You approved:  Sunday through Thursday, to 12:00 a.m., and Friday and Saturday, to 1:00 a.m.  This came before the BOA in order to get the hours of operation lengthened.  The BOA overturned the Commission's decision and decided on the following hours of operation:  Sunday through Wednesday to 10:30 p.m., and  Thursday to Saturday to 1:00 a.m.

SPEAKER (S):
(+) Cristine Patterson - Project Sponsor
- They purchased their home in 1996.  Originally, the building was built with three units.

- The property has been in disrepair.
- There has been a lot of tenant turnover in the units, because the units offer livability for only one or two people.  There have been many young married couples renting the units, but whey they had children they had to move because the units are so small.
- If they were able to merge the units and bring it back to a full floor unit that would accommodate a family or roommates, it would be more convenient for the tenants.

1415-1417 GUERRERO STREET- east side between 26thand Army (Cesar Chavez) Streets, Lot 011B in Assessor's Block 6568 - A Discretionary Review Request of Building Permit Application Number 2001.07.02.2861, a proposal to (1) raise the existing structure by approximately three feet and excavate portions of the site to accommodate a new four-car parking garage at semi-below-grade level and (2) perform interior and exterior alterations including but not limited to the construction of a new rear deck and stairs and an expansion of habitable area in the rear of the structure. The property is within an RH-3 (Residential, House, Three-Family) Zoning District and a 50-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project as proposed.
SPEAKER (S):
(-) Jennifer Fong - Discretionary Review Requestor
- Since she filed the Discretionary Review, the project sponsor has revised his plans, but there are still issues that need to be dealt with.
- There is a street tree that will be affected with this construction.
- The tree is the major green space on the street.
- She questioned the health of the new replacement tree.
- She wants to contest the Planning Department's review of the parking situation caused by the garage.
- She is concerned that there will be structural damage to her property when the proposed property is raised.
(+)  Lisa Nakajara
- She has three areas of concerns: 1) safety and an increase in traffic congestion; 2) negative impact on street noise and beautification of the area; 3) direct impact on her building.
- There are a very large number of cars traveling at high speeds in the area.
- She would love to see the buildings cleaned up, but she is concerned about the tree that will be lost.
- She is at home during the day.  She is concerned that she will not be able to continue living there because there might be construction damage, and because there is a shared wall with the proposed project.
(-) Ana Sears
- She and her husband have lived on Guerrero Street for the last 20 years.
- They have seen many serious accidents.
-  The garage in their building has been impossible to use.  In order to maneuver a vehicle into the garage entrance, which is 6 feet from the corner of Cesar Chavez and only 12 feet wide, the vehicle also has to be perpendicular to the flow of traffic.
- During commute hours, there are is even a larger number of cars coming around the corner, almost blindly.
(-) David Jon
- He has lived on Guerrero Street since 1968.
- He has worked with the Police Department for 23 years.
- If this project is built, there will be three parking spots taken away and this will affect the neighbors.
- The construction will cause an indentation on the sidewalk.
- There is a senior day program nearby and there are a lot of seniors that come participate.  The proposed construction could have a negative effect on them.
(-) Michelle Gettos
- She has lived on Guerrero Street for many years.
-  She contests the Planning Department's review on parking.
- She has a concern of the increased traffic on the street.
- She hopes that the Commission will disapprove the project.
(-) Gary Nathan
- He is concerned that the character of the neighborhood will not be maintained with the proposed project.
(-) Jorge Morashima
- There is traffic safety issue with this project.
- He feels that these issues have extraordinary and exceptional circumstances.
- The proposed project is a mirror image of the adjacent house, so it will definitely not look good for one to be higher than the other.
- The loss to the street is one of the beautiful characteristics of the street.
(+) Simon Quan - Project Architect.
- The project sponsor was not able to come to the hearing.
- He explained the architectural aspects of the project.
- It is very difficult to lift the building and provide parking, but it will add quality to the building.
- From a construction point of view the building will be reinforced and made safer.
- To accommodate this construction there will be professional construction and structural companies to do the work.
- The reason to move the tree is to be able to maneuver cars into the garage.
-
ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and disapproved the project.

Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project  as proposed
SPEAKER (S):
(-) Peter Heinemann - Discretionary Review requestor
- He holds an easement over the staircase area.
- The easement covers the entire staircase.
- The proposed project would cover a large amount of the easement area.
- The easement does not permit the owner to construct any improvements.
- He is confused about the City's policy since the permit application itself requires disclosing this information.
- The better policy is to have the DR granted and maintain the status quo.
- The owner gave up certain property rights when the easement was given up.
(-) Tom Whelan
- He is in support of Mr. Peter Heinemann.
- Everyone is sympathetic of the problem of walling up the stairs.
(-) Patricia Shean
- She is in support of taking Discretionary Review and Mr. Heinemann's comments.
- This does encroach in a manner that blocks the egress and ingress.
(+) Julia Baird - Representing Project Sponsor
- She displayed a diagram of where the other [chair] would be installed.
- There would not be a lot of space used from the easement.
- When the chair is not in use, the chair would be on top and tucked away.
- The Discretionary Review requestors are concerned that there would be large alterations on the easement.
- The project sponsor has a right to do construction on his property so long as there is no blockage to the egress and ingress.
