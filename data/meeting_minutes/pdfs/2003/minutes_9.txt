TRANSFER AND REUSE OF NAVAL STATION TRESURE ISLAND-Joint Public Hearing by the Planning Commission and the Treasure Island Development Authority on the Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR).The DEIR evaluates the potential environmental impacts of the reuse of most of Naval Station Treasure Island (NSTI) following transfer from the U.S. Navy. NSTI includes both Yerba Buena Island and Treasure Island, located in Central San Francisco Bay, within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City and County of San Francisco. The proposed project is the Reuse Plan for NSTI (1996), which includes a variety of public oriented uses such as an expanded marina in Clipper Cove, sports fields, a film production center, conference center, hotels, a themed attraction, educational and child care facilities, a fire fighter training school, public open space, and up to 2,800 housing units. The Navy has published a separate Final Environmental Impact Statement evaluating the potential environmental effects of the disposal and reuse of NSTI to comply with Federal requirements.
Preliminary Recommendation: No Action Required
Note: The deadline for the submittal of written comments has been extended to 5:00 pm on October 21, 2003.
SPEAKER(S):
Karen Knowles-Pierce - Treasure Island Development Authority
- She thanked the Commission for scheduling this hearing today.
- Her concern is for a type of bird in the Falcon species and the impact this project will have on them.  The EIR states that there will be less than significant impacts on these Falcons.
- Pedestrian and bicycle facilities should be provided.
- In the EIR there is a statement that mentions the sale of property to private owners.  This language should be changed to state that there would be no sales to private owners.
- Traffic concerns especially during peak hours should be looked at closely.
- Lack of public transportation is a concern.
- There will be significant impacts that cannot be mitigated.
Susan Bryan - Alliance for a Better District 6
- She is concerned about the health of residents during construction and what measures will be taken to minimize these concerns.
- There should be strict adherence to standards.
- She is concerned about insurance problems for homes built on soils prone to liquefaction.
- Public transportation will be very difficult.
Eve Bach - Arc Ecology
- She thanked the MEA staff for their work on this EIR.
- If the goals and policies are not put in the redevelopment plan as a requirement then the EIR does not describe the plan properly.
- This EIR is supposed to provide project level review of the Marina project and there is almost no information on this.
ACTION: None.  This hearing was held only to receive public comment and comments from the Commissions.
