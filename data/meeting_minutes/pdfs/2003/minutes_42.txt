SPEAKER(S):
Re:  Continuance
Marilyn Amini
- She agrees with this continuance because there are a lot of people who are still "in the dark" about this legislation.
- The public comment on this issue has been fragmented.
- She held up about 100 letters addressed to the Board of Supervisors who are opposed to the secondary units.  She will make a copy and send it to the Planning Commission for the public record.
- The public record should be consolidated into one file to make it easier for Commissioners to review.
- It was discussed at previous meetings that notice of this legislation be sent to all residents of San Francisco.
Dorcas Maureen Bender - Preserve Our Neighbors
- It would be a shame for San Francisco to allow Secondary Units and turn the City into a Manhattan.
- She was born and brought up here and believes that the City should remain a lovely place to live.
- The changes in the secondary units, housing element, etc will destroy San Francisco.
- She agrees with the continuance.
Maria Sousa
- She supports the continuance of this legislation but suggests it be continued further than the date stated.
- She does not believe that it is appropriate to have the hearing on the proposed date because the housing element hearing will be held on October 9, 2003.

B. COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
10. Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner William Lee:
Re:  Residential Design Guidelines
When the Commission has a hearing on the Residential Design Guidelines, he would like a representative from the San Francisco AIA to provide comments on the document.
Re:  Housing Element
- He wants to know what are the impacts if there is a delay in certifying the Housing Element?  Will we be loosing the opportunity to compete or receive money from the State?
- He recommends that the Planning Department send a letter to the Mayor's Office of Housing to receive their comments on impacts.
Re: Self Certification
- It was his understanding that State legislation has been proposed that would allow the Commission to self-certify as a City.  He would like a briefing on August 28, 2003 from the City Attorney.
Re:  Budget
- The budget was signed recently.  But some of the budget items, like fee increases, were not increased.  He would like a status report on that.  Some of the funding for the Department of Planning has been placed on reserve.  The overall budget, with identifying line items, should be provided to the Commission whether it be during the work plan deliberation, etc.  He would like this within a two month period.
Re: Land Use Committee
- He requested that the Acting Planning Director meet with the Chair of the Land Use Committee - Supervisor Jake McGoldrick -- on an ongoing basis because there are a lot of Planning Commission cases that are being challenged at the Land Use Committee and then to the full Board.  His suggestion would be to have meetings with Supervisor McGoldrick in order to educate him and give him the background on cases that are being challenged so he has the information that he needs when it gets to his Committee.
Re:  Demolition Conditions Reports
- He would like to revisit the demolition conditions reports that goes from 50% to 75%.
- He requested the status/affect on projects that started in the Planning Department years ago relative to demolition requests before the Commission instituted the 75%.
Commissioner Antonini:
Re: Request to the City Attorney
- He has questions on jurisdiction and procedures regarding Secondary Units, Demolition and Residential Design Guidelines.  He would like an opinion from the City Attorney on why these legislations are going on at the same time when the Housing Element contains many of these legislations.
Re:  Demolitions
- He agrees with Commissioner William Lee regarding demolitions because it seems like the Commission is changing the rules in the middle of the game.
Commissioner Boyd:
Re: Housing Element
- He requested that staff produce an outline of how they see protracted series of events that need to take place toward the approval of the Housing Element, and then toward the General Plan.  It should spell out within that time frame the basic hurdles that need to be crossed so that the Commission could be more responsible.  Also, incorporate the concerns that have been raised in the various public testimonies.
Commission Bradford Bell:
Re:  Land Use Committee
- She agrees that the Acting Planning Director should be involved in meeting with Supervisor Jake McGoldrick on cases that are being challenged as Commission William Lee stated.  That is a practice that she and Director Green have been involved in, and she would like to continue to be involved.
Re:  Planning Commission Hearings:
September 25, 2003
- At this hearing the issue of Director Green's leave will be address because the Deputy City Attorney will be present.
After November 14, 2003
- Review of the Planning Commission Secretary's performance evaluation will be scheduled [in closed session].
October 9, 2003
- The Housing Element will be scheduled.
Re:  Acting Planning Director
- She welcomed Larry Badiner as the Acting Planning Director and is looking forward to working with him.
- She knows that Director Green will be available to discuss matters with Commissioners and Mr. Badiner.
C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT
11. Director's Announcements
Re:  His acceptance as Acting Director:
- He explained to the Commission that he took on this responsibility because Mr. Green had a wonderful opportunity to be at Harvard and he wanted to support him on that as well as support the Commission.
- Mr. Green has been on vacation since about August 11.  He has been in and out of the office and he has been working closely with him.
- They are in constant communication.  Mr. Green will be officially on leave from the beginning of September, when he heads off to Harvard.
- He has been broadening his experience in other divisions of the department and has been meeting extensively with Dr. Ghosh and his staff, Mr. Maltzer and the Environmental Review staff and picking up issues and carrying them forward.  He has been learning a lot and getting a handle on the issues that are before him and the Department.
Re:  Budget
- The budget implications are just starting to shake out.
- He received on Monday, the final budget.  Staff is studying it to examine what all of the implications are in response to Commissioner Lee's request.
- He believes there is about $120,000 on reserve for South of Market environmental review.
- Part of the Department's budget, a good portion of it, was related to a fee ordinance which included changes, modifications and increases in fees.
- This issue went before the Land Use Committee and since then, some issues were raised.  Staff is working with the City Attorney, the Mayor's Office, and the Controller to make sure that the fees are fully legal.
- This is one of the highest priorities of the Department.  In order to meet the budget, the Department needs to get these issues resolved and the fees passed.
Re:  Restructuring of the Department
- He has been meeting with members of the Senior Management staff in order to respond to a variety of different issues including the budget, number of vacancies, reorganization or shifts that have been made with him becoming Acting Director and Mr. Nixon becoming Zoning Administrator.
- He is trying to figure out what the implications are, how the Planning Information Counter is being managed, how computers are being managed and how neighborhood planning is being managed.  There may have to be some incremental adjustments on how the quadrants are divided, who the supervisors are, etc.
Re:  Miscellaneous
Hearing of September 4, 2003:
- Major issues over the next two months that will be before the Commission include on September 4, a records retention policy presentation.  As mandated by law, the Commission must review and, [subject to modifications,] adopt it.
Hearing of September 11, 2003:
- On September 11, there will be a presentation on the Discretionary Review (DR) process which was requested by the Commission.
- Many members of the public are concerned that the existing DR process doesn't seem to address either the neighborhood's needs or project sponsor's needs.  They also don't seem to address staff needs in terms of resources or the Commission's needs.
- Staff has thoughts and proposals.
- This would be an informational hearing just to open up the discussion.
Hearing of September 18, 2003:
- On the September 18 there will be a joint hearing with the Redevelopment Agency on the Mid-Market EIR and Exterior Alterations.
Alternating Hearings:
- In September the Commission calendar will alternate Discretionary Reviews and Conditional Use cases.
Hearing of October 2, 2003:
- On October 2 there will be another joint hearing with Treasure Island on the draft Environmental Impact Report.
Hearing of October 9, 2003:
- On October 9 is the Housing Element.
Hearing of October 16, 2003:
- On October 16, staff is proposing the Eastern Neighborhoods,
Hearing of October 23, 2003:
- On October 23, staff is proposing a review of the Residential Design Guidelines.
- So the Commission, as well as staff, has a full calendar for the next couple of months.
- Director Green and I will be working very closely to make sure those are in proper order for the Commission and the public.
Housing Element:
- This issue is on a very tight schedule to get the information to the Commission for October 9.
- As Commission President Shelley Bradford Bell said, comments are due this Friday, but staff will certainly accept them by Monday.
- Then staff really needs to turn them around and get them out to the Commission three weeks in advance--that would be September 17.
- He will be working with Dr. Ghosh and his staff to get that out on the 18thof September as well as update the web site.
- There will be extensive outreach -- like newspaper advertisements in the Chronicle, the Examiner, and a list of the neighborhood newspapers.  It will be placed on Commission calendar notices; there will be public service announcements on radio, television, City Watch, and community newspapers; announcements to the Board of Supervisors, on the Planning Department's web site, at the public libraries, and a general mailing to advocates and community groups.
- There was a comment made under Public Comment that staff is not implementing the Residential Design Guidelines, that is not accurate.
- Staff is implementing these guidelines.
- Staff is also proposing to revise them as there are concerns about the 12-year-old  Guidelines and various discussion about how well they address all of the neighborhood concerns and all the Planning concerns.
Re:  Department of Building Inspection
- Recently, DBI has issued a new process for critical needed additions because apparently there have been complaints of illegal demolitions, alterations, etc.  But they've been violating a lot of the planning laws.
- Projects come to Planning, get approval then go to DBI, get approved and do illegal units with illegal additions.
- Perhaps two applications should be filed, one for the alteration, and the other for the substantial demolition of the building.
12. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
BOS - None
BOA - None
D. PUBLIC COMMENT ON AGENDA ITEMS WHERE THE PUBLIC HEARING HAS BEEN CLOSED
At this time, members of the public who wish to address the Commission on agenda items that have already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the public hearing has been closed, must do so at this time.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
John Carney
Re:  450 Rhone Island
- There are a number of items inaccurate in the EIR.
- There are issues of asbestos, and additional tests should be done.  If there is asbestos material present, then many people will be sued.
- He actually stopped the progress of this project before because of the issue of asbestos.
- This project is being built on a hazardous site.
- As long as the subsoil is not touched then there will not be any problems.

The proposed project consists of  two elements: the first is two ordinances introduced by the Board of Supervisors amending the San Francisco Planning Code (including Zoning Maps 8 and 8SU) to change the zoning on the block bounded by Rhode Island, 17th, Kansas and Mariposa Streets from M-1 (Light Industrial) to NC-3 (Moderate-Scale Neighborhood Commercial).  The proposed legislation would also add Section 781.10, which would create a 17th and Rhode Island Street Grocery Store Special Use Subdistrict applicable to the block described above to permit a neighborhood grocery store with beer and wine sales on that block.   The second element is a proposed development that would involve the construction of a five-story building ranging in height from 16 ½ feet to 52 ½ feet and containing about 204,800 square feet of mixed-use residential/retail space.  The project would include approximately 168 residential units, approximately 4,000 square feet of retail space, and approximately 34,500 square feet of grocery store space.  In addition, a parking garage would partially occupy three levels, providing a total of approximately 323 self-park off-street parking spaces.  The new proposed building would step-up the north slope of the Potrero Hill project site (Assessor's Block 3978, Lot 1), which is bounded by 17thStreet on the north, Rhode Island Street on the east, Mariposa Street on the south, and Kansas Street on the west.

SPEAKER(S):
(+) Sharline Curtis - Project Sponsor

- They are currently speaking with grocery store companies, trying to come to an agreement.
(+) David Johnson - Project Architect
- This mixed-use project has been the response of the community's input.
- The most important goals of this project consist of the following:  1) shift the mass of the building down the hill away from Mariposa toward 17thStreet; 2) enhance the neighborhood retail serving character of 17thStreet; 3) express the narrow lot width of the neighborhood by dividing the building into distinct residential segments; 4) emphasize the residential and pedestrian scale; 5) create approximately 30 pedestrian access points along the perimeter of the project; and 6) balance the coverage of the building on the site with generous open space.
(-) Babette Drefke
- It bothers her to hear there was "community input" when she has not been invited to participate.
- There is so much need for family housing that this project should be for that.
- The area can be rezoned to residential.  Then build housing units.
- She has issues about the height.
- 52 ½ feet will make this area a windy tunnel.
(-) John Carney
- Nowhere in the environmental report does it require asbestos testing.
- Why are intersections away from the project being improved when the intersections near the project are the ones that should be improved?
- This project should be downgraded to residential.
(+) Julie Milburn - California College of Arts and Crafts
- She read a letter from the president of the Potrero Boosters who is in support of this project.

Cathy Shereet
- She attended the meetings on this project and saw the plans, pictures, etc.
- The project sponsor has made many revisions to this project.

- She does not agree to a continuance request because nothing can be changed if the project does not get started.
Peggy Lenartowicz - Jersey Street Neighbors for Responsible Growth
- She just received the plans less than one week ago.
- The new plans are incomplete.
- There are about 900 signatures throughout Noe Valley and the City of San Francisco who are opposed to the project.
- A continuance is desperately needed.
Lou Blazej
- Representatives of Noe Valley and other neighborhood organizations who are not here asking for a continuance.
- There are a lot of people who just do not like this project.
- He hopes that the Commission will hear this project because the project sponsor has done all they can to accommodate the issues and requests from the neighbors.
Paul Catis - East and West Castro Street Improvement Club
- There are a lot of items that need to get "ironed" out so a continuance is appropriate.
SPEAKER(S):
Re:  Merits of the Case
(+) Lou Blazej - Project Sponsor
- He displayed a photograph of the current location and the proposed structure.
- He and the Project Sponsor have done their best to meet the concerns of the neighbors.
- There will be six residential units, more retail space, no new curb cuts, metered parking, etc.
(-) Paul Kantus - East and West of Castro Improvement Club
- This building is a four story building on a two story building block.
- This project will set a present for anyone who will want to tear down a home and build a huge building
- This building is too tall.
(+) John Brunn - Friends of Noe Valley
- They are unanimously opposed to this project and hopes that the Commission will listen to the desires of the neighborhood.
(-) Peggy Lenartowicz - Jersey Street Neighbors for Responsible Growth
- The design that is currently being presented to the Commission, she received only about one week ago.
- They are very adamant about having the top floor removed, set back or no set back.
- This project is going to present a negative impact on the neighborhood.
- They are asking for preservation of their neighborhood.

(-) Anastasia Yovanopoulos - Friends of Noe Valley

(-) Ean Yovanopis
- Noe Valley has always been known as a very "wonderful community."
- This area makes it different than any other places in this country.
- Part of the beauty is the sense of community and the buildings.
- This project is just too big and out of scale.
(-) Amalia Ahruia-Hartwell - Friends of Noe Valley
- There should be restrictions on the residents of this structure.
- Many of the neighborhood associations of the area are against this project.
- The first picture that the developer presented is really what was intended.  There has not been much change done to the design.

(+) Jeremy Paul
- He is a neighbor and knows that the building to be demolished is a place that needs to be addressed because it is an eyesore.
- He is strongly in favor of this project.
(+) Elise Langer
- She is concerned about how traffic will be enforced.
- What will prevent them from having one or more cars?  Where will they park?
- She requested a condition requiring developers to provide parking at another location, prevent public access from the back for security, privacy and noise.
- She also requested that the Planning Commission authorize residential parking permits on three blocks of Jersey, Church, Sanchez, Noe and Castro.  This would mitigate the impact on parking.
(-) Stephen Jane - Jersey Street Neighbors for Responsible Growth
- He lives on Jersey Street.
- He is opposed to the design plans because they don't show dimensions and don't show the height at all.
- The Commission cannot evaluate accurately the impact of a building until there are design drawings that accurately show the height of all the existing structures that surround the buildings and that accurately show dimensions.
- He asked the developer to provide a diagram showing the relationship between the proposed building and the buildings on Jersey Street and they did not provide this to them.  The information on the story pole showing the height was not provided to them either.
(+) Brandon Mere - Painting Contractor
- The project will have a Victorian facade with pleasant color schemes and top quality materials inside and outside.
- The construction will fit the surrounding neighborhood.

- Because of the elevation of the home, and if one is standing on the roof of the project, the roof tops of the homes appear as if they were all the same elevation.
(-) Clara Filter
- She has belonged to Friends of Noe Valley since 1971 after she lost a Planning battle by one vote and was told it was because they were not organized.
- She is worried about the precedent this project will create in the area.
- If everyone involved had been at the three meetings with the Friends of Noe Valley, seen what is being presented today, there would be a lot less to talk about tonight.
- They were never shown these new facades or modifications.
(+) Carol Deny - President of Noe Valley Merchants Association
- When this project started they were unhappy with a number of Issues, they were unhappy with the design specifically.
- They just want to make sure that designs in Noe Valley follow the Residential Design Guidelines.
- They are very happy with the Victorian design.
- The other issue that the Merchants have is that they actually wanted the parking and they were convinced by Friends of Noe Valley that it would be much better for the neighborhood, for walking on 24th street, if they gave in on the issue of parking.
- As far as he is concerned, the design that they saw this week met with satisfaction of the Merchant Association, and they are very happy with the response they got from the builder.

- Many other buildings are over 30 feet.
- She urged the Commission to vote favorably.
(+) Joe O'Donaghue - Residential Builders
- People seem to think that what is big is ugly.
- This project sponsor in this instance is putting as much incredible attention to detail In the rear of the building as he is on the front of the building.
- When one looks out the window, one will mostly see a beautifully designed building from the rear.  As well as obviously what would appear from the front.
(+) Rodrigo Santos - Structural Engineer
- His firm was asked to do a structural investigation of the [existing] building.
- He made the investigation on observations and testing.
- He found it is not only a blight but structurally unsound building.
- It is made out of all bricks with practically no mortar.
- The framing is 2 by 8 framing.
- There is no structural element in that building according to code.
- He is suggesting a complete demolition of the building and replacement with an architecturally well thought out structure.  And that is what has been presented by the project sponsor.
(+) Drake Gardner - Principal Designer
- When he initially designed this project, he went full envelope allowed by the Planning Code, including parking.
- He went with a modern design.  He always tries to integrate in the community if he can.
- Although we're modernists, we are quite able to do traditional buildings.
- He presented this project to the community and got a lot of feedback.
- It became apparent that the height and bulk were going to be an issue, the style was going to be an issue.  So they had to rethink the project.
(+) Lou Pine
- He has worked in the lighting industry in San Francisco for 19 years.
- He deals with all sorts of builders.

Preliminary Recommendation:  Take Discretionary Review and Approve the Project with Modifications.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Raymond Hill - Discretionary Review Requestor
- He moved into this area in 1981.
- He is concerned that the new construction will pass the back part of his house and he will open his window and there will be a wall there.
- He is also concerned that the project will make his house lose value.
- The new construction is just huge.
(-) Tom Bura
- He welcomes construction in the neighborhood because they want to be good neighbors, but the project sponsor should abide by the fact that this is a Single-Family home area.
- If this project is built as proposed it will increase the parking problems in the neighborhood because the house has a garage for one car only.
(-) Brian Trahian
- The concerns that most of the neighbors have is that most of the homes in the neighborhood are made up of single-family, modest homes that are mostly owner occupied, but this construction is begging to be converted into a multifamily type of dwelling.
- This project is three times the size of the homes in this neighborhood.
- It just really needs to be scaled down.
(-) Chris Vera
- He is concerned with the size of the new construction.
- He believes it is just too large for the neighborhood.
(-) Anderson (did not state last name)
- He is opposed to this project because it is too large.
- He feels that it is twice the size of the homes in the neighborhood and it only has a one car garage.
- It just does not fit into this neighborhood.
(+) James Lee - Engineer and Designer
- He displayed diagrams showing the interior and exterior design of the house.
- The house needs to be that size because the Project Sponsor plans to have his entire family live there.

Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and Approve the Project with Modifications.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Deborah Delambert - Discretionary Review Requestor
- She has a correction; it is not true that her building is taller than the proposed plan.  It is somewhere above her second story.
- She is not opposing to the square footage that this project is proposing.
- She is just asking that the second story of the building not protrude so far into the backyard, this would be in keeping with the neighborhood character and pattern of development.
- She displayed photographs comparing the Project Sponsor's plan with her plan.
(-) Scott McFurdy
- He lives on Day Street, one lot east and downhill from the proposed project.
- He did not agree to the modifications as proposed.
- He wants to reiterate what was said in that he is not opposed to the development of this property or to the square footage that the project sponsor wants.
- He is actually in favor of that.
- What he is opposed to is the distribution of the square footage because it will have a negative impact on him as immediate neighbors and to the neighborhood as a whole.
- He feels that 461 Day will bury his home.
- The project will dump him between an existing 17 foot high wall to the east and a proposed even bigger 24 foot wall plus a peaked wall to the west.
(-) Chandler Visher
- He and his wife own property on Day Street.
- He would like to hire an architect to develop a plan that would be architecturally consistent with the present plan.
- One of the concerns the project sponsors had was that they don't like the idea that their present plan has a different slope than the existing slope.
- The existing slope is steeper.  He feels that a plan that is more consistent with the neighborhood would be better.
(+) Jane Phillips - Project Sponsor
- She has lived on Day Street for nearly 23 years.
- What she is proposed is a modest expansion for only the amount of space that she really needed.
- She has had several meetings with the neighbors.

- He has tried to accommodate his neighbor's concerns without sacrificing the architecture of his home and the modest space that they have.
(+) Sarah St. Clair
- She lives with her parents and often wonders why she is living in a closet.
- She really wants a second story.
- She believes that sometimes her life and the live of her parents would be much easier if - Her parents are very hard-working people and they need more space to work.
(+) William Pashelinksy - Project Architect.
- The design of the new building will clearly change the appearance of the current cottage.
- One of the points brought up was the nature of tearing down these types of houses and having the impact upon San Francisco Streets.
- The project sponsor feels strongly in terms of preserving the feeling of a cottage.
- The rooms are so modest in size that Sarah's bedroom cannot have a closet.
ACTION: Take Discretionary Review  with the following modifications of the subject building permit application:  Revision R-1 of the Building Permit Application for the project shall be approved as submitted on July 31, 2003 provided that the closet and window on the west wall of the second floor bedroom shall be flipped on the plan  such that the projecting close is moved forward on the building.
