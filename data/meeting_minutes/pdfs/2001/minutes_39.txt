C.DIRECTOR'S REPORT
5.Director's Announcements
Transit Impact Development Fee Analysis and Planning Report:
This report 
      was given to the Commissioners in anticipation of an informational hearing.This informational hearing will be held at the discretion of the 
      Commission.
During the Planning Commission hearing of May 17, 2001, a series of briefings 
      will be held on the status of the process to replace IPZ interim controls.These briefings should be held before the August 6, 2001 deadline.These briefings will be in the form of a status report.
During the 
      Planning Commission hearing of June 7, 2001, there will be a discussion 
      on the annual limit program rules.
Finance 
      Committee Hearing
-He appeared before the Finance Committee to 
      respond to the Department's request for a supplemental appropriation.
- In February, 
      the Director spoke to the Commission to endorse the Department's work program.The Department is actually generating more fee revenue than originally 
      forecasted.He found a need to allocate those funds specifically 
      to expand the existing Balboa Park Better Neighborhood's program, fund an 
      appropriate planning process and community-based planning process to replace 
      the IPZ Interim Controls, and assure that we had proper funds to carry out 
      the necessary environmental review for these Interim Controls.It was important to have positions to help 
      carry out this work.One of these 
      positions is a liaison to the Board of Supervisors with the new and increased 
      workload resulting from district representation.
- He asked 
      for 1.9 million dollars in order to carry the work out and fill these positions. 
      The Committee recommended to the full board that they do provide the funding 
      to carry out the consultant driven work, to continue the Better Neighborhoods 
      program but they did not approve the funds for the 4 positions.The Committee deferred the funding for the 4 positions to be taken 
      up as part of the full budget process, which starts in June.That was the decision of the budget analyst for the Board of Supervisors.The Director opposed since this decision would 
      delay work.
- An Interim 
      Acceptance Process was then agreed upon which will allow some of the revenue 
      from the planning budget in June 2001 to cover these positions.They will make a decision to allow us to proceed 
      even though they have not authorized these salaries.This will protect the integrity of the full 
      budget process.
Housing, 
      Transportation and Land Use Committee Hearing
Larry Badiner, 
      Ken Chin and Scott Sanchez of the Planning Department, represented the department 
      regarding wireless communications and antennas.
- There were 
      representatives from wireless communications companies as well as representatives 
      from an organization called SNAFOO.There were discussions of implementing a moratorium by neighborhood 
      groups.Mr. Badiner had to leave 
      the meeting early so he doesn't know the results of this request.The department will analyze the guidelines 
      and find out the results of this meeting and report to the Commission on 
      May 17, 2001.
6.Review of Past Week's Events at the Board 
      of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
Board 
      of Appeals
May 
      2, 2001 Hearing
4616 
      18thStreet– This project was a dwelling unit merger and 
      the Commission denied the merger.The 
      BOA overturned the Commission's decision because although the board feels 
      that the Commission's DR policy is a good policy, the board is making their 
      decisions on a case-by-case basis.The 
      board decided that this case was in the  pipeline , that it was not a monster 
      home, and that there would be no loss of rental housing.The board is not overturning the Commission's DR policy just the 
      decision on this specific case.
May 
      9, 2001 Hearing
690 
      DeHaro Street –The Commission 
      voted to take DR on this case, then it went to the BOA and the board upheld 
      the Commission's decision.The subdivision 
      from DPW went to the BOS and the board denied the subdivision based upon 
      environmental issues and general planning issues.
The 
      question came up of rehearing the case on the DR.If there is substantial new information that could affect the project, 
      the board could allow a rehearing yet the board did not believe that a new 
      hearing should be held.The board 
      felt that the new information did not affect their decision.
696 
      Pennsylvania Street– This is a live/work project, the Commission took 
      mandatory DR.The Zoning Administrator 
      issued a notice of violation and the BOA overturned his decision.
1800 
      Mission Street (Armory)– This was an appeal of a negative declaration 
      for a  server farm .The Commission 
      upheld the negative declaration and a DR was filed, this DR did not come 
      to the attention of the department, the ZA issued a suspension of the work 
      order.The BOA decided to continue the suspension 
      until after the hearing at the Commission.Whatever the decision the Commission makes, the board will consider 
      it.

      Octavia Neighborhood Plan.
SPEAKER(S):
(+) 
      Patricia Walkin
-She wants to express 
      the enthusiasm that the community has shown.
- 
      All presentations have been well attended.People have been very pleased with the planning.
- 
      This plan accommodates their goals by providing housing that fits criteria 
      for affordable housing.
- 
      They are happy to increase the density of the neighborhood without increasing 
      congestion.
- 
      Many parts of this neighborhood are crime-ridden.When there are a lot of shops and good pedestrian traffic this can 
      deter crime.
- 
      They are thankful that they were one of the three neighborhoods chosen.
- 
      They are happy to build the Octavia Boulevard.
- 
      This plan will be great for the neighborhood as well as the whole city.
- 
      This will become an interesting and diverse community.
(+) 
      Rob Levit– Member of the Board of the Hayes Valley Neighborhood Organization
- 
      He is not going to repeat the comments from the previous speaker yet he 
      agrees with everything she said.
- 
      He will say that everyone is very enthusiastic about the planning process.
- 
      This planning process opens up an opportunity for improvement in the neighborhood.
- 
      He just wants to say thank you!
- 
      They have been talking about the neighborhood as being a pedestrian neighborhood 
      and being transit friendly.They 
      have been pushing to reduce the parking requirements and build affordable 
      housing and having more pedestrian traffic.
(+) 
      Joe Curtin- President of the Castro 
      Area Planning In Action
- 
      He agrees with the previous speakers.
- 
      The workshops have been very successful.
- 
      They are anxious to work with planning staff.
- 
      The development of the Market Street plan will connect various areas of 
      the City to the subject area.
- 
      This street is the most important street of the City.
- 
      He hopes this program continues for many years.

      an SSO (Service/Secondary Office) zoning district, and a 50-X Height and 
      Bulk District.

261-271 COLUMBUS AVENUE (CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE)- south side of street between Jack Kerouac Street and Broadway.Assessor's Block 162, Lot 18.The 
      subject property is zoned Broadway NCD (Neighborhood Commercial District) 
      and is in a 65-A-1 Height and Bulk District.This hearing is for the consideration of approval of the proposed 
      Landmark Designation of the City Lights Bookstore as Landmark No. 228.Approval of the proposed Landmark Designation was recommended by 
      the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board to the Planning Commission at 
      the Board's public hearing on March 21, 2001.
Preliminary Recommendation: Approval
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Daniel Reidy – Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board
- He is honored to bring this designation to the Commission.
- It has been one of the most personally satisfying projects that 
      he has worked on since being appointed by the Mayor to serve on the Landmarks 
      Advisory Board about 5 years ago.
- They developed a case report with a combination of work with staff 
      and their board and Tim Kelley, who is a historian, actually did the major 
      work on the drafting of the original case report.
- There was universal support.In 
      Paris, they believe that the building has already received a landmark designation.
- A number of people thought that they could take the case report 
      and add new material.People who 
      had access to the North Beach Survey, the owners themselves thought that 
      there could be corrections and augmentation of the material.There were two distinguished published writers:Lorence Furlingetti and Nancy Petters who contributed 
      information.
- GG Platt and other preservation people felt that there had to be 
      more architectural attention to the building and the architect.Although he was not well known, a lot of his 
      work was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake.The architect was really a master.
- He recommends that this building be dedicated as an architectural 
      landmark.
(+) Gerry Crowley – President of Telegraph Hill Dwellers Association
- There are about 791 members and were founded in 1954, just one 
      year after Lawrence Furlingetti and his partner found the City Lights Books 
      Store.
- The historical significance of its place and the literary culture 
      of this nation are well documented.
- Since their inception, Telegraph Hill Dwellers mission has been 
      to protect and preserve neighborhood character.

SPEAKER(S):
(+) John Luna – Project Sponsor
- He is here to represent his family's business, 
      the Border CafÃ© and Cantina.
- 
      The Border CafÃ© and Cantina has a long history in the South of Market area 
      and so does his family.
- 
      Ignacio Luna Sr. came to this country as a  bracero  a Mexican immigrant 
      contract worker.Ten years after 
      his arrival he opened a delicatessen business in the South of Market area.He was the only Mexican business owner in the 
      area.An accomplishment he is very 
      proud of.
- 
      In 1964, he expanded and opened a business on Folsom and 8thStreet, the project site.The business 
      was a delicatessen,  La Ideal Deli .However, 
      when his father, Ignacio Luna, Jr., took over, he diversified the deli's 
      business by incorporating a Mexican restaurant, entertainment and comedy.
- 
      As a third generation business owner, his father has given him the opportunity 
      his father gave him; the opportunity to continue to run the family business.
- 
      Obtaining the proper permits are very important to him.
- 
      The restrictions for entertainment hours are very restrictive.
- 
      Originally they had requested to operate entertainment 24 hours a day, 7 
      days a week.
- 
      After community meetings, Officer Rose Meyer made some suggestions, which 
      he agreed to regarding the hours of operation:dancing after hours on Friday and Saturday until 4:00 a.m. only.He agreed if she would agree to endorse all 
      night dance if they operate the nightclub responsibly.
- 
      He has gone around and explained to several neighbors of what he intends 
      to do.He has assured them that 
      he will operate responsibly.He 
      has given several neighbors his phone number so that they can call him in 
      case there are any problems or complaints.
- 
      He plans to keep a cordial relationship with the neighbors.
- He is asking for unrestricted hours 6:00 a.m. 
      to 2:00 a.m. on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursdays.6:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. on Friday and Saturday.
(+) Officer Rose Meyer – Permit Officer, San Francisco Police 
      Department
- She is not here representing the chief or 
      the police department.She is here 
      representing Captain O'Hara.
- She is not here to advocate the nightclub.
- Mr. Luna has not yet applied for a police 
      permit, just an amendment to the change of hours.He wanted to come to the Commission first.
(+) Jim Meko – SOMA Leadership Council
- He read the 7 angry letters, which are attached 
      to the file of this project. He contacted l the people who wrote these letters.He spoke to the angriest and the saddest.
- Sleep deprivation can kill you.
- John Luna keeps his promises.He has known the Luna's for about 20 years.This family has run a business for about 36 years.John will show others what it means to respect your neighborhood.The Late Night Coalition is here to support this club.
(+) Tarrance Allen- San Francisco Late Night 
      Coalition
- History is in front of the Commissioners eyes.They were formed to control and make sure that not all of the clubs 
      be closed.
- He urges the Commission to approve this proposal 
      and consider that economic vitality is very important in the City.
- He knows that when businesses are shut down 
      and landlords are not allowed to open their businesses, the neighborhood 
      becomes blighted.
(+) John Ward – San Francisco Late Night 
      Coalition
- They are putting themselves on the line to 
      stay with this situation.
- They have stressed to John Luna for his business 
      to be a model business.
(+) Leslie Ayres – San Francisco Late Night 
      Coalition
- What they have been dealing with over 
      the last years is a loss of business permits where people can go dance late 
      at night
- There are visitors who come to the City to 
      dance.
- This business has been around for 36 years 
      and is responsible operator.
(+) Fareka – neighbor
- She is here to show her support to John Luna.
(+) Darek Boyle
- In the 4 years he has been working in the 
      South of Market area he has not had any problems with the club.
(+) Kevin – neighbor
- In the South of Market, socializing is done mostly in clubs.
- He supports this project.
(-) Daniel Dabcosky
- He is a native San Franciscan and is faced 
      with a situation.He has worked 
      hard his entire life to pursue the American dream and acquire a piece of 
      property about 3 years ago.He purchased 
      a 4-unit building with his entire life savings.This property is located right across from the Border Cantina.
- He knows that the area is zoned mixed use 
      yet he opposes this proposal.
- When he purchased his property the noise level 
      in the area was tolerable.
- Several new clubs have opened so the noise 
      has become intolerable.
- He has called the police about 10 to 12 times.
- The livelihood of all the residents has become 
      quite difficult.
- There are times when he has not been able 
      to sleep until about 3:00 a.m.This 
      makes it quite difficult for a person to function if they have to get up 
      the next day to go to work.
ACTION:Approved with amended hours:allow dancing and amplified entertainment from 
      Sunday through Thursday until 2:00 a.m. and from Friday and Saturday until 
      4:00 a.m.

      involves the displacement of a production, distribution or repair business 
      in an M-1 (Light Industrial) Zoning District and a 40-X Height and Bulk 
      District, pursuant to Planning Commission Resolution No. 14861.The subject property falls within the IPZ (Industrial 
      Protection Zone) buffer of the interim zoning controls for industrially 
      zoned lands.The State of California 
      has issued an abatement order to demolish the building in order to remediate 
      contaminated soil on both the subject and adjacent properties.
Preliminary 
      Recommendation:Approval with conditions
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Barbara Cook – California 
      Department of Toxic Substance Control
- Her department has approved 
      two plans, which require the excavation of contaminated soil from the 1212 
      Thomas Avenue as well as the residential properties and a vacant lot.
- The plans ask for all 
      contaminated soil to be removed.
- The building must be 
      demolished because the excavation of the soil must be of varying depths 
      and she wants to be sure that it's done safely, effectively and quickly.
- This demolition permit 
      and conditional use permit must be issued quickly in order to begin the 
      work.
- The requirement is that 
      no heavy equipment be used.Their 
      intent was that the project sponsor not come out with a big bulldozer since 
      it's near other structures and fences separating residential structures.
(+) Nicholas van Aelstyn 
      - Attorney
- He is representing the 
      Bay Area Drum Ad Hoc PRP Group
- As Ms. Cook indicated 
      that group has entered into an agreement to implement the cleanup of the 
      property as well as the eight adjoining residential properties.
- The buildings and the lot next to it contain piles of drums.Behind the pile of drums are the eight residential 
      properties.
- The community has been 
      demanding this clean up for many years.
- There has been thorough 
      public comment and communication.There 
      have been countless meetings with neighbors, public organizations, etc.
- They seek approval in 
      order to implement the plans.It 
      is critical; otherwise, the work will not be done before the rains come.
(+) Jim Cantrell
- He is here to support 
      the demolitions.He is one of the 
      residents that abut this particular property.His biggest concern is that he is the grandfather of 8 children and 
      they cannot play in his back yard.
- There have been some 
      obstacles but he hopes that the Commission will approve the project.
(+) Gladys Madison
- She is a resident near 
      this site.There are 8 families 
      in the back of the project site.She 
      was able to see all the undesirable things that went on.Her late husband used to ask the owner of the property to cover 
      all the barrels because there were children near by.
- The time is up and something 
      needs to be done.
- Now the responsible people 
      want to do the cleanup.
- The job needs to go on 
      because no one wants to live around these chemicals.
(+) Maverick H. Madison
- He would like to show 
      support of demolition to this building.
- It is time to do the 
      clean up.They have been poisoned 
      for many years.
- They had no idea what 
      the various types of chemicals were on the site.
- The building needs to 
      come down in order to do thorough cleanup.
- He asks the Commission 
      to use their good judgment and show concern to the residents of this area.
- This clean up is absolutely 
      necessary.
- There are a number of 
      cases of asthma and breast cancer among the residents of this area.
(+) Raymond Jack, Jr.
- His father purchased 
      a property in this area.
- He grew up playing in 
      toxic substances and didn't even know it.
- He hopes that the Commission 
      supports the demolition of this building so that there can be toxic clean 
      up.

14.2000.1244C(SANCHEZ: 558-6679)
2489-2491 WASHINGTON STREET- southeast 
      corner at Fillmore Street; Lot 022 in Assessor's Block 0612.Request for Conditional Use Authorization 
      pursuant to Section 718.83 of the Planning Code to install a total of three 
      antennas within one 6.25 inch wide by 57 inch high cylinder flagpole and 
      an equipment shelter within the basement of an existing two-story, wholly 
      commercial building, as part of Sprint PCS's wireless telecommunications 
      network within the Upper Fillmore Neighborhood Commercial District (NCD) 
      and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.As 
      per the City & County of San Francisco's Wireless Transmission Services 
      (WTS) Facilities Sitting Guidelines the proposal is a Preference 6.
Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with conditions
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Robert Krebs – Representing Project Sponsor – Sprint PCS
- The building is entirely commercial and is located in the Upper 
      Fillmore district.
- Licensed professional engineer, Dane Erickson from Hammet and Erickson, 
      is here to answer any questions.
- The conditional use petition for this location complies with the 
      WTS Guidelines, the San Francisco Municipal Code and the Federal Communication's 
      Commission Radio Frequency Emissions Standards.
- Under the WTS Guidelines, the design is visually unobtrusive since 
      the antennas will be located inside a flagpole and the equipment will be 
      located in the basement.
- All sites of a high preference were considered but they were not 
      technologically feasible or were not available for lease.
- This installation will ensure emergency communications when LAN 
      lines are not working.Will increase 
      the safety for visitors and residents of San Francisco.
- Two community outreach meetings were held.532 owners and tenants and 6 neighborhood organizations were contacted 
      in 3 languages.No one attended 
      the first meeting and 3 members of the community attended the 2ndmeeting.
(-) Kate Jones – Body/Mind Movement
- She lives at  ground zero!
- The announcement for the installation of these antennas comes in 
      the most un-descriptive envelope.Only 
      someone is very diligent about opening their mail would be able to notice 
      these communications.
- She is a health care practitioner and is very concerned about the 
      health hazards of these waves transmitted by these antennas.
- There are more and more reports being published about complaints 
      by people who have been exposed to these antennas.
(+) Sue Hestor
- Is the area of coverage Sacramento to Broadway to Steiner to Buchanan 
      – that's 15 blocks?
- When the first hearings were held regarding antennas and the amount 
      of antennas that would be needed to cover the city, people were saying that 
      there would be thousands of antennas.
- If the areas of coverage of one of these antennas are 15 blocks, 
      the density of antennas would be a lot.

MOTION No.16161
15.2001.0164T(YOUNG: 558-6346)
ORDINANCE ADDING AN ALTERNATIVE 
      PROCEDURE FOR CONDITIONAL USE APPEALS-Consideration of an amendment to Planning Code Section 
      308.1 to authorize an additional conditional use appeal procedure wherein 
      four members of the Board of Supervisors may subscribe to a conditional 
      use appeal.Testimony and Commission 
      considerations could result in recommendations of modifications to the proposed 
      legislation.
Preliminary Recommendation:Approval
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Supervisor Peskin
- He appreciates the opportunity to address the Commission on this 
      important legislation.
- He is here to explain the legislation introduced in early February.
- He would like to thank the Department and staff for all the help 
      on the number of issues.
- This ordinance would expand the way conditional uses are appealed 
      to the Board of Supervisors.As 
      staff described, it would allow 4 Supervisors to bring a conditional use 
      appeal to bring it to the Board of Supervisors.
- He has always found that as neighborhood leader and a supervisor 
      that the code is problematic since tenants and business owners have no recourse 
      to appeal a conditional use under the current code.
- Opponents of this legislation have raised various questions.
- He is prepared to introduce an amendment to the Board of Supervisors 
      that would provide a sunset clause to the legislation.
- It is important to know that he is not trying to change the super 
      majority of the Board.
- His office is well aware of how long it takes for this legislation 
      to become law.
- He is happy to make all of this clear so that there are no misunderstandings.
(-) Ken Cleveland – Building Owners and Managers Association
- This is an issue that is very big to property owners across the 
      city.
- He agrees with President Theoharis that there is an adequate procedure 
      going on right now.If there needs 
      to be some tweaking of this process that's fine.But to add the ability of 4 supervisors to appeal a conditional use 
      decision adds incredible uncertainty to a process that is already uncertain.We don't need to raise costs we need to lower costs.
- It is outrageous.The current 
      conditional use process works.It 
      allows input from all the residents of San Francisco.
- Enacting this would devalue the real estate.
(+) Ann Ronce
- She urges the Commission to support Supervisor Peskin's legislation.
- In her neighborhood, Nob Hill, thousands of people opposed a very 
      controversial conditional use permit.Virtually 
      none of those people were able to appeal the Commission's decision.
- Some of the abuses that the Commission is worried about exist under 
      the current regulations.
- She is surprised to know that the Commission thinks that there 
      is a lack of evidence.
- She would like the Commission to reconsider and approve this legislation.
(+) Tho Do – Secretary/Treasurer of Local 2 Union
- She is here to speak on behalf of the union and to speak on behalf 
      of Supervisor Peskin.
- She and the Union believe that the procedure that shut out the 
      renters and the workers who live in different areas.The union believes that they are empowering workers in the workplace 
      to have a voice and make changes in their working conditions.They encourage that same right in their neighborhoods 
      and where they live.
- They encourage the Commission to acknowledge this and to pass this 
      legislation.
(-) Frank Notu – Golden Gate Heights Neighborhood Association
- They have 500 dues-paying members.They are concerned that this legislation will put more power to the 
      BOS at the expense of neighbors.They 
      have some serious objections.Although 
      the Supervisors might have good intentions, there are some real problems 
      here.This legislation applies to both approvals 
      and disapprovals.
- There was a question if this legislation was a power-grab.He doesn't see any reason for taking power 
      from neighborhood property owners and giving it to 4 supervisors.
- A developer can come to 4 supervisors to appeal a decision.There is nothing in the legislation, which 
      prevents this.
- He has no problems with renters and appeals.
- Neighborhood homeowners have few rights when it comes to land use 
      decisions.He doesn't think that 
      it's right to dilute these rights and give it to the BOS.
(+) Jerry Crowley – President of the Telegraph Hill Dwellers Association
- This organization has just fewer than 800 members.There are tenants, owners and business owners in the membership.
- She is here representing the entire membership.
- When conditional use authorizations 
      are considered the code requires that it be beneficial to businesses nearby, 
      tenants and owners.When it comes 
      to an appeal only property owners have that option.
- She urges the Commission to consider that there must be a democratic 
      process and have the ability to appeal.
(+) Robert McCarthy – McCarthy and Swartz – on behalf of 450 Sutter 
      Partners
- Although this might come as a shock to the Commissioners but he 
      agrees with Supervisor Peskin.
- This is an issue about due process and this is an issue about fairness.
- There are only 34 projects involved in the retroactivity.
- There should absolutely be fairness.
- Ms. Crowly mentioned it – we need democracy.
- There are projects on the list that are involved in this retroactivity 
      that have no opposition at all.
- This is about the confidence of people.
(+) Peter Sotos – Vice President Harsch Investments
- They are the owners of 450 Sutter Street.
- Turner Construction is a 100-year firm, all union shop.He is very troubled about the retroactivity 
      of the legislation.
- He was outraged about this legislation.
(-) Joel Yodowitz – Reuben and Alter
- San Francisco's existing conditional use process is geared to allow 
      those most affected by conditional use authorizations those within 300 feet 
      of a project to appeal the Commission's decision weather pro or con to the 
      BOS.
- The proposed amendment will undercut this fundamental aspect of 
      conditional uses, which gives the largest voice to the subject property's 
      neighbors.
- The proposed amendment will undercut the authority of the Planning 
      Department to consider land use and zoning matters.
- It would allow delays and uncertainties to the planning process.This would discourage development and economic 
      growth.
- He urges the Commission to disapprove this legislation.
(+) Alice Barkley
- She is a renter so she has no right to sign a petition.
- She recommends that 20% of the tenants within 300 degree radius.
- Right now, an applicant who is denied by this Commission cannot 
      go to the BOS, he has to go out and get 20%.This should be corrected so that all stakeholders have a right to 
      it.
- She believes that the problems regarding time and energy are that 
      it takes a lot of energy to organize something.
- Because staff and Supervisor Peskin stated that there is an amendment, 
      the language is not before the public, a due process requires that this 
      language be communicated.
(+) Sue Hestor
- It is hard to represent low-income tenants and tell them they can't 
      appeal a decision that goes against them at the Commission.She has been telling them that for the past 20 years.
- Every one of the Commissioners lives in an RH-1 and RH-2 zones.People in these zones have multiple rights.
- It is justice for people who live in renter dense areas.They can't get to the BOS.
- The policies of prop M are also in the General Plan.
- Right now it only takes one person to appeal those projects.One person with a $100.00 fee can appeal a 
      case to the Board of Appeals.
- She has not been able to take anything downtown to the BOS.
- She thinks it's grossly unfair.
(+) John Bartis
- He has seen this process over the last 30 years and sees that it 
      works.
- Someone who is a property owner and happens to do something with 
      his or her property can get it done.
- Who has the super right?The 
      person who files the application?
- The Commission can make changes to the legislation form Supervisor 
      Peskin.But he recommends that the BOS rewrite the 
      legislation.
- He urges the Commission not to reject this.
(+) John Barbey
- He recently filed a conditional use that they had to gather signatures 
      for.Though the area has a lot of 
      absentee landlords, they almost miraculously got unanimous signatures from 
      the owners.
- It seems appropriate to him that the tenants and the business owners 
      have a say in the same way.He commends 
      this legislation.

16.2001.0175T(YOUNG: 558-6346)
ORDINANCE ADDING REGULATIONS GOVERNING MERGER 
      OF DWELLING UNITSConsideration of Amendments to the Planning Code to 
      add a new Section 303(h), requiring conditional use approval for the merger 
      of dwelling units. Testimony and Commission considerations could result 
      in recommendations of modifications to the proposed legislation.
Preliminary Recommendation: Approval
SPEAKER(S):
(+) John Henry Cruz – Office of Supervisor Gonzalez
- This legislation is something that they have taken a lead on from 
      the Commission.
- These are things that this body usually considers:how the removal of the unit would affect the housing stock; how 
      hardship on displacement are minimized; if replacement of the units is proposed; 
      if the removal of the unit would bring a building to a closer conformity 
      of the prevailing unit density; if removal of the unit is necessary to correct 
      design or functional deficiencies; if removal of the unit is necessary to 
      preserve or rehabilitate the structure; whether that unit is intended for 
      the occupancy of the actual owner and/or any other criteria deemed appropriate.
(-) Robert McCarthy
- This caught his attention because he was here for another reason.
- He is a father of 5 children.He was able to purchase a house to accommodate his large family.
- It is very difficult to justify the proposal as currently drafted 
      on the basis that it doesn't amount to consistency with the general plan.
- This discourages families from being able to stay in San Francisco.
- This needs to be studied further.San Francisco is a very wonderful and diverse city with many immigrant 
      families.
- The real issue is that it's an expensive process.
- This needs a little bit more work and needs some fine-tuning.
(-) Patricia Vaughey
- The dialogue 
      should be kept open on this.
- She has seen both sides of the story.She has seen someone with a lot of money Ellis Act a building and 
      the case gets scheduled three weeks later.If a young family comes to the department to get their case before 
      the Commission, it gets scheduled months later.
- The average cost of a house in San Francisco is $420,000.She is very sad about this because there are 
      a lot of people who cannot afford this.
- She has to look at both sides.
- There is an inequity with the current legislation and there is 
      an inequity with this legislation.
(-) Jim Cassio
- He was introduced to the Commission in December when there was 
      a decision made for an mandatory Discretionary Review on a dwelling unit 
      merger.Last Monday, he was watching a Board of Supervisor's 
      meeting and Supervisor Gonzalez spoke about dwelling unit mergers.
- What the Commission is doing about Discretionary Reviews for dwelling 
      unit mergers is a bad idea.
- But then he thought that the Commission needs to know when units 
      are taken off the market because of dwelling unit mergers.
- Please vote no on this legislation since he believes that the Commission 
      has this under control.
(-) Alice Barkley
- She is glad that the office of Supervisor Gonzalez seems to be 
      willing to continue this issue to study it further.
- She has a problem with this legislation since filling out conditional 
      use applications takes an enormous amount of time.
- Homeowners should not have to hire a lawyer to come before the 
      Commission because they have a family need.
- Most applicants that come before the Commission have a real need 
      as far as quality of life.
- There are many items in this legislation that she needs to have 
      explained.
- There are another criteria that are so vague that it needs to be 
      thought about further.
- She hopes that the office of the Supervisor gives some clarification.
(-) Brett Gladstone
- It is interesting that he is the third permit attorney that is 
      opposed to this legislation.
- He doesn't think that the Board of Supervisor's staff can spend 
      the amount of time necessary for each case like Planning Department staff.

E.SPECIAL DISCRETIONARY REVIEW HEARING
At Approximately7:20PMthe Planning Commission convened 
      into a Special Discretionary Review (DR) Hearing.
17.2001.0198D(NIKITAS: 558-6306)
25 RICO WAY- between Avila Street and 
      Retiro Way, Lot 0439A in Assessor's Block 052. Request for Discretionary 
      Review of Building Permit ApplicationNo. 2000/11/03/4794.The proposal 
      is to demolish an existing two-story residence and construct a new three-story 
      single-family home in an RH-1 (Residential, House, One-Family) District 
      and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take DR and approve project as revised 
      by the project sponsor.
(Continued from Regular Meeting of April 26, 2001)
SPEAKER(S):
(-) James Meyers
- He lives on Rico Way.
- Rico Way is a street scape of 1920s Mediterranean style home.
- In Ms. Barkley's letter she included on the last page a 3-dimensional 
      diagram, which shows the project as smaller than the other buildings.This diagram is quite misleading.
- He displayed the same diagram but drew the proposed project to scale.
- This project is a  poster child  for disruptive design.
- He displayed a map of Rico Way, which shared the homes which signed a 
      statement of opposition or submitted statements where it stated that they 
      were mislead by being told that the DR requestors were in agreement with 
      the project.
(-) Richard Dike
- He is not here to oppose the construction but to look for a compromise 
      on the elevator shaft.
- It is not only that it greatly obstructs their view of the Golden Gate 
      Bridge and the Marin Headlands but it also obstructs their sunlight from 
      the west that hits the back of the house and their yard where their children 
      play.
- He understands about expansion since he just had some expansion done 
      to his house.
- He would just like the elevator shaft removed.
(-) Kelley (last name unclear)
- She is the other neighbor mentioned in Ms. Barkley's letter.
- She doesn't believe that this construction belongs in the Marina.
- During a community meeting, the planner stated that the elevator shaft 
      was not in contention.
- At the time the request was made, the elevator shaft had been taken out.It is her impression that the elevator shaft is an issue with all 
      the neighbors.
- She had requested story poles so that they can prove that the elevator 
      shaft would be an obstruction to the neighbors.
- She is a big believer that everyone should cooperate with one another 
      since all the homes in the Marina are so close together.
(-) Barbara Rogers
- She is here in opposition of the proposed structure.
- She is a 25 year resident of San Francisco.Although she does not live in the Marina she works there taking 
      care of children. Even though they are very young children, they do know 
      that the Marina is a beautiful district.
- The design is not keeping with the guidelines.
- If this project is approved, there will be other houses that will want 
      to follow.
- She read a letter from a neighbor who is opposed to the project and was 
      not able to attend the hearing.
(-) Carolyn Ganini
- Her opposition of this construction stems from the fact that she feels 
      in recent year much has been done to diminish the look of the Marina Gardens.It has taken away from the character of the neighborhood.
- She has seen a change in the homes, which have been allowed to go up.
- After the Loma Prieta earthquake, she had to do many alternations to 
      her home.
- Many changes have been good since many homes have kept the faÃ§ade.
- This construction is not architecturally or aesthetically acceptable.
- She would like to keep the look of Rico Way.
- The City has taken upon a project to keep the architectural heritage 
      of the libraries.
(-) Lois Beldochi
- She is interested in neighborhood preservation.
- She is involved in maintaining historic sites and belongs to a preservation 
      organization.
- She has two units on 18thStreet, which runs into Market.
- She received notice that right next to that unit on 18thStreet 
      there was a large unit being built.She 
      became tired of fighting it and the large unit went up.
- She bolted down her faÃ§ade on her house in the Marina.She dreads another earthquake.
- In Spain, when you want to add to your house you must keep the faÃ§ade.
(-) Joe O'Donahue
- Residential builders rebuilt many of the homes in the Marina.
- He has lived in the Marina and knows the sensitivity of the residents.
- This design should really be brought back to the drawing board.
- He does not mean that it needs to be exactly the way it was but it should 
      be similar to the character of the neighborhood.
(-) Catherine Certavitch
- She read a letter from a neighbor who is against the project and could 
      not attend the hearing.
(+) Alice Barkley – Representing Project Sponsor
- There is a photo in the case packet, which shows the whole bock face.It is quite obvious that there are very diverse buildings and faÃ§ades 
      on the street.
- The design, which was revised and recommended by staff, has an additional 
      detail.She has asked the homeowner 
      to add another cornice line.This 
      will be an improvement and an additional detail.
- There are two issues here; one is whether the faÃ§ade is appropriate.The other issue is the penthouse.
- They chose the elevator shaft instead of a stair penthouse since a stair 
      penthouse would be much larger and much longer.The project sponsor chose to put a circular staircase in the back 
      even though it will be difficult to move furniture up there.
- The elevator shaft will be an impairment of the view but not a total 
      blockage.
(+) Louis Butler – Project Architect
- The ceiling heights on the building are 10 feet on the top floor and 
      over 11 feet on the main floor and 8 feet on the bottom floor.
- The building is 35 feet high.The 
      elevator shaft is 10 feet high.
- One of the nice things about working with Ms. Barkley is that she covered 
      all the important points.
- When soil is re-compacted on the site, it needs to be pressure grabbed 
      and that takes a lot of machinery.It 
      also takes a lot of machinery to build a three-foot thick floating slab.This is required because it's an unstable location.
- With respect to the faÃ§ade, they have followed the code and neighborhood 
      design guidelines to the letter.
- They looked at the buildings in the neighborhood and there was quite 
      a variety.He feels that the building 
      will be a nice addition to the block.
- What the Commissioners see on paper is entirely correct.
(+) Rebecca Schumacker – Project Sponsor
- She apologizes for being here today since she hoped she and the DR requestor 
      could have come to an agreement.
- The so called  marina style  is not just one particular type of style.
- The Spanish tile that her neighbor is requesting to incorporate to the 
      new construction, can be found in various neighborhoods of this City.
(+) Patricia Schumacker
- She read a letter from a neighbor who is in support of the construction 
      but could not attend the hearing because of surgery.
(+) Guido Piccinini
- He came to this country in 1950 from Tuscany with his parents and sister.He is a retired restaurant owner and he and his wife are trying to 
      have a home where they will be the rest of their lives.The idea of the elevator is because as they get older, it will become 
      more difficult for them to climb up the stairs.
- His mother will come to live with them as well.
- He would like to clear up some misconceptions. He went door to door to 
      show the original design to all their neighbors.
- There are many facts that have been misrepresented in the petition.
- They have a design that is within code and fits the neighborhood character.There are people here that want to design their house for them but 
      he is putting his faith in the system and hopes that the Commission will

240 SAN FERNANDO WAY-west side of the street between Monterey Boulevard and Darien Way, Lot 
      004A in Assessor's Block 3251 request for Discretionary Review of Building 
      Permit Application No. 2000/09/25/1401, proposing to construct a one-story 
      vertical addition, infill portions of the building footprint, and alter 
      the front facade of an existing single-family dwelling located in a RH-1 
      (D)(Residential, House, One-Family, Detached) 
      District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary 
      Review and approve the project as submitted.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Stephen Murphy – 1stDR Requestor
- He lives across the street from the subject 
      house for about 8 years.
- There was list of signatures opposing the 
      project that was not included in the packet that went to the Commissioners.This was a grievous error since the planner stated that the neighbors 
      support this project.
- He displayed a map that shows the block where 
      the subject property is.
- There have been various neighbors who oppose 
      the project.
- They take great issue with this project for 
      several reasons.He is not opposed 
      to his neighbor constructing an addition to his house.Yet, it is not justifiable to construct an addition and double the 
      square footage just because there was water in the basement.
- This neighborhood was designed with strict 
      guidelines and rules.
- There are walking easements, which are wide.The houses have a variety of styles yet there is consistency.These styles include the way the entire neighborhood is structured.
- His primary objection with this construction 
      is that his neighbor fails to take into account the consistent context of 
      Balboa Terrace.By adding a second 
      story on a prominent block, he is changing the character of the neighborhood.
- There are neighbors here who live in the vicinity 
      and the architect will speak today.
(-) Stanley Markel – 2ndDR Requestor
- He lives on San Benito Way.He purchased his home in 1994.Not having an architectural background it is 
      hard for him to explain things without architectural language.
- If one walks around in the neighborhood, one 
      can see that there is certain similarity in all the homes in the area.
- It is the character of the neighborhood, which 
      he would like to preserve.
- The reasons he opposes the project is that: 
      1) the home breaks with the adjacent homes; 2) It also breaks with the character 
      of the area.
- There was a project in Santa Ana Street, which 
      was different from the other homes, and stands out from the rest of the 
      homes.
- He retained two architects just to be able 
      to describe how the homes look in Balboa Terrace.
- Adding a second story to a home where the 
      adjacent homes are only one story, will be an inconsistent volume and mass.
(-) Martin Herrman
- He owns 
      a home on San Fernando Way.He would 
      like to state that he has been doing construction on his home by putting 
      foundation because of water damage.He 
      is in full support of having construction on their homes.
- Any addition to the project sponsor's home 
      is fine but that it falls within reason.
- Someone doubling the size of his or her house 
      is just not right.The square footage 
      of the home is doubling on a small lot.
- His issue is the size of the house.
(-) Gerald Bernstein
- He lives on San Fernando Way.He has lived at this address for 16 years.He has made minor renovation to his house with neighbor's compliments 
      and not complaints.
- His concerns are that the house needs work 
      but a more compatible design would be more acceptable.
- He hopes that the Commission grants a Discretionary 
      Review or a continuance so that the design can be revised.
- The uphill houses are two stories or 1Â½.The downhill side are the one stories.
- The proposed change in Mr. Lee's house takes 
      him square footage wise to be the largest house on the block.
(-) Patty Murphy
- She 
      read a letter from a next-door neighbor to the project sponsor who is against 
      the project but was not able to attend the hearing because of the short 
      notice.
(-) Bob Olsen
- He lives 
      on Balboa Terrace about three blocks away from the subject property.He is past board member of the Balboa Terrace 
      Association so he is very much in favor of keeping the character of the 
      neighborhood.
- His house was considered to be a one story 
      yet the back of the house looks like a two story house.
- He chose to maintain the neighborhood character 
      and not alienate his neighbors.
(-) Chris McMahon - Architect
- He lives on Eureka Street and is a licensed 
      architect.He wrote a letter, which 
      he submitted, to the Commissioners.
- The proposed design is the most insensitive 
      design since it is not in keeping with the rest of the homes.
(+) David Lee – Project Sponsor
- He just heard all his neighbors speak and 
      wishes he could have heard them two years ago.It is very important to him and to his family to build this addition.He understands that it is important to his neighbors as well.
- Two years ago when he acquired the property, 
      he was aware that the house was in bad shape and that there was a stream 
      running below the house.
- He sent letters inviting his neighbors to 
      come to his house to sit and talk about the plans he had for his house.
- He made a presentation to the CC&R committee 
      and they gave him an approval.
- The Balboa Terrace community has an annual 
      meeting; two thirds of the neighbors voted these DR's applicants out of 
      the board.
- This was difficult for him because he has 
      gone through numerous revisions.
- Another problem he has had was to conform 
      to Planning Department requirements.He 
      argues and protests, because he made many revisions based on neighbor's 
      comments.Staff mentioned to him 
      that the design was still not in conformance.
- He does not know when this will end.When he found out all the neighbors who were 
      opposed, he went to mediation to try to resolve the issues.He wants peace.
(+) Michael Jones – Vice President of the 
      Balboa Terrace Homeowners Association
- He appreciates the comments made by the Commission 
      regarding the letter dated January 21.The association has very limited authority over what can be done 
      in the neighborhood.They are going 
      to consider having more stringent authority.The letter was issued only to inform the owner that the project doesn't 
      violate any of the deed restrictions.
- Very recently there was an effort made by 
      a board member to mediate between the neighbors and Mr. Lee but it was not 
      successful.
- There are homes in the neighborhood that were 
      built in the 50s and 40s.They do 
      want to preserve the character of the neighborhood.
- Mr. Lee has made an effort to keep the design 
      compatible with neighboring buildings.
(+) Yevgeniy Bogodist
- He is a resident of San Fernando Way.His home was built in 1927.This is a very old style.He supports Mr. Lee's proposed design because 
      old style is old style.It's ok 
      to renovate buildings.
- Mr. Lee's house has many damaged areas.
- The neighborhood is supposed to be better.If no one improves his or her homes, it will not become a better 
      neighborhood.
- He will also want to improve his home eventually.
- San Leandro Street has many similar buildings.
(+) Robert Lin
- He lives on Santa Ana Street.He is here to support Mr. Lee's project.He didn't know that everyone pointed the finger at him.When he came to this country with 3 family members.Now his family has grown so he expanded his home.
- After he built his expansion, his neighbors 
      did not complain.
- It is a good thing to upgrade your house since 
      we are living in an earthquake zone.
- This is a free country and everyone has to 
      compromise.There are many large 
      families here.
(+) Shao Lin Kao
- An interpreter read her letter to the Commission.She is in support of the project.
(+) Alex Lee
- His father is the project sponsor.
- They sent out 3 notifications to the neighbors 
      surrounding their house.
- They have gone through 30 revisions.
- The current design of the proposed construction 
      will not block any sunlight from their neighbors.
(+) Eddie Chen
- He has lived in San Francisco for about 8 
      years.He hears a lot of stories 
      and finally he heard a story
- He is very angry about all the problems going 
      on.

4038 17TH STREET-north side 
      between Castro and Douglass Streets, Lot 011 inAssessor's Block 
      2623.Request of Discretionary Review 
      of Building Demolition Permit Application No. 9814005 and Building Permit 
      Application No. 9814006, to demolish an existing one‑story over garage, 
      single‑family dwelling and construct a new three‑story over 
      garage, three‑family dwelling in an RH‑3 (Residential, House, 
      Three‑Family) District and a 40‑X Height and Bulk District. 
      Note: This project was previously heard by the Commission on April 6, 2000.Following public testimony, the Commission moved to continue the 
      hearing indefinitely, so the Project Sponsor could develop a design that(1) does not require demolition of the existing structure; (2) retains 
      a substantial portion of the front part of the Victorian house; and (3) 
      allowsthree dwelling units to be 
      constructed on the site.The revised project proposes to relocate the 
      existing building facade both forward and at a lower elevation than the 
      existing location, demolish the remaining structure behind the facade and 
      construct a three‑story over garage, three‑family dwelling addition 
      behind the preserved facade. The revised project would also require the 
      justification of a rear yard variance, which will be heard by the Zoning 
      Administrator concurrently with the discretionary review.
Preliminary Recommendation: 
      Because the revised project has been determined to be a demolition by the 
      Department of Building Inspection under the Building Code, it is, therefore, 
      inconsistent with the Commission's instructions as communicated on April 
      6, 2000.
SPEAKER(S):
Regarding 
      Request for Continuance:
(+) Amanda 
      C. Leuis- Attorney
- She 
      is requesting that the Commission grant a continuance so that she can become 
      familiar with this case since she was just recently hired.
- She 
      believes that as she becomes familiar with this case, she will be able to 
      resolve it favorably.
- She 
      agrees with the continuance date of June 7, 2001.
(-) Judith 
      Hoyem – DR Requestor
- She 
      would like to say that under normal circumstances the Commissioners would 
      grant a continuance with no problem.But 
      this is not normal circumstance since firing an attorney at the last meeting 
      before a hearing is not a  good-faith  gesture.
- There 
      is no evidence that the project sponsor has any good faith intentions.
- The 
      new attorney has indicated to her that the project sponsor now wants to 
      sit down and try to resolve the issues.This is something that she has wanted to do since the beginning.
- She 
      would like for the project sponsor to talk to her and meet with her.
(-) Andrew 
      Laws
- He 
      came from southern Arizona for this hearing.
- He 
      feels that this is an incredible stressful ordeal for his mother to go through.
- He 
      would like some sort of guidelines and be done with project that does not 
      conform.
(-) Gustavo 
      Cerena – Corresponding Secretary – Eureka Valley Promotion Association
- He 
      supports Judith Hoyem's concern that a continuance will not show any more 
      good faith from the project sponsor.
- Many 
      people have taken time off to come and speak today and their time should 
      be honored.
(-) Mark 
      Riser – Twin Peaks East Neighborhood Association
- He 
      supports the request for continuance as articulated by Ms. Hoyem.
- They 
      have been incredulous from the beginning.
(-) Ann 
      Ferrar
- She 
      just rushed here to be involved at the hearing.
- A little 
      less than a year ago there was a hearing for the project and the Commission 
      made a decision yet the project sponsor did not honor that decision.
- This 
      does not seem like a very democratic process.It is hard to bring all these people again to testify.
- This 
      is just not right.
(-) Steve 
      Bartoletti
- He 
      did not come prepared to speak.
- All 
      of the people here have taken time out of their busy lives to come here.
- The 
      old attorney is standing just outside of the hearing room and he is very 
      much able to come inside and have the hearing.
- The 
      new plans have nothing to do with what the Commission's decision was.
