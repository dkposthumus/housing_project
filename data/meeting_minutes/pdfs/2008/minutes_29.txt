Francisco Da Costa

(Continued from Regular Meeting ofMay 15, 2008)
SPEAKER(S)
(-)Sue Hestor, Appellant
-One of the main issues is the context.It is a requirement to be analyzed in the environmental document as well as in the staff's report because this is a building over 80 feet and it needs to be looked at in-light of adjacent buildings.
-Because it is on a sloppy site, the plan elevations are incredibly difficult to read.It lacks numbers to compare the sections to each other.
-There is no analysis of what the over 80-foot project would be in any of the reports.There is no staff report that really gives dimensions.There is no report from the developers.What is the setback on Grant Avenue?
(-)Pamela Duffy, Appellant
-In examining the problems with the contextual findings, it is still unclear how the recent architectural effort translates into compatibility for the purposes of the visual impacts in the environmental document's negative declaration.
(-)Garret Gerntsen
-Concerned with the impacts, amount of construction, the demolition and the shadows this is going to create.
(-)Peter Friel
-Concerned about the construction impacts to the businesses.And it is going to increase shadows significantly.
(+)Tim Colen
-We are not clear what environmental issues really are taken into consideration.CEQA is being used to try to stop a project that from our point of view represents a step forward in land use.
Shelby Campbell
-We are compelled to speak on the base on the issues of context and height because they are being raised under the CEQA review.
(+)Alan MartÃ­nez
-Taller buildings do not aggressively impact the district.The proposed project is not out of scale with the other buildings on Grant Avenue.
-[Showed photographs of the block of Grant Avenue that has three buildings over 100 feet tall]
Al
-It is clear that this project is going to cast big shadows directly affecting the residents across the street.

11a.2004.1245EKVX(Tapes IA; IB; IIA)(J. MILLER: (415) 558-6344)
300 GRANT AVENUE (aka 272 and 290 Sutter Street)-northeast corner at Sutter Street, Lots 13 and 14 in Assessor's Block 287, in a C-3-R (Downtown Retail) District and an 80-130-F Height and Bulk District -Request for review under Planning Code ("Code") Section 309of the construction of a new, ten-story mixed-use building containing approximately 45 dwelling units, approximately 16,000 square feet of ground- and second-floor retail space, and up to 40 off-street parking spaces in a two-level underground garage, requiring the authorization of exceptions to Code standards for height above 80 feet, building bulk, rear yard, and off-street parking, as well as the granting of Variances of Code standards fordwelling-unit exposure and projections into required open area.
Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions
(Continued from Regular Meeting ofMay 15, 2008)
SPEAKER(S)
Shelby Campbell, Project Sponsor
-Over the past year and half extensive resources and efforts have been invested to respond to the magnitude of input we received on this project.
-We like the third design.We met with our neighbors and they like it too.
-What it really comes down to is the discussion of further reductions in height, and we are going to focus on that today.
Alan MartÃ­nez
-There are a lot of issues about height within the district.There are historic buildings of 150, 130, 170, and 190 feet without adversely impacting the district.
-[Showed photographs of the block of the proposed project on the east side with three buildings over 100 feet tall]The proposed project is not out of scale.
-In response to all the input we received since January, '07, the project sponsor has redesigned the building three times and reduced it from 12 stories to 10 stories; the height from 130 feet to 113 feet; from 54 to 45 units, and we've added setbacks.
(-)Pamela Duffy
-The facts are that the building has been reduced by four feet only.
-We do not believe that the staff's analysis is accurate in terms of the satisfaction of the exception.We do not believe that the standards for this sensitive location have been met.
(-)Sue Hestor
-The changes in design have been minimal.The exceptions for 80 feet while at the same time pushing the building longer on Holland Street at the higher level, cuts off sunlight.
-Requested that the top two stories be taken off.Lower the building to have an appropriate transition to other buildings and to have a building more in conformity.
(-)Scott House
-Concerned that the project would block the sunlight.
(-)Patrick Breithenback
-Concerned about the sunlight blockage.We support housing and we ask the developers to be sensitive to the residential quality in the immediate neighborhood.
(+)Jim Salinas Jr.
-This project has cooperated with and responded to extensive input on this project over the half year.It is time to focus on the benefits of downtown housing and high quality retail space.
(-)Peter Friel
-This is going to impact the neighborhood during construction, by blocking sunlight, and by increasing the current heavy traffic.
Stephanie Perry
-The project is going to impact the businesses by blocking sunlight.
(+)Andrew Richard
-We want to build a sense of community in this area and part of that is encouraging housing developments.This project would accomplish that.
(+)Tim Colen
-This is a thoughtful attempt to bring housing density closer to jobs in the downtown area.
(+)Michael Adhler
-This building really responds favorably to the district, texture and form of the adjacent properties.Plus it brings much needed housing.
(-)[No name stated]
-There is not any difference on height and bulk from the previous designs.It is going to cast us in shadows.
ACTION:Approved with the creation and implementation of a system to track whether or not  families  are moving into the units.

SPEAKER(S)
Marge Vincent, Project Sponsor
-I am here basically to answer any questions you may have.All the identified former tenants have been either settled with or offered a settlement.
Francisco Da Costa

15.Commission Comments/Questions
Â·Inquiries/Announcements.Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
Â·Future Meetings/Agendas.At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Moore
-I have been very interested in the Transit Effectiveness Program and I would like to suggest that we have a special meeting on that.Generally we need an overview, but more specifics on the projects that are up coming or currently under consideration.
-This is relatively a new thing and I think we would be well advised to be more fluent with that tool and what is being done.
Commissioner Antonini
-I just wanted to mention that the Examiner had an article last week regarding ABAG reassessment of housing and it has been acknowledgement that San Francisco has to provide a larger share of it relative to the suburban areas.
Commissioner Sugaya
-Now that the EIS is out on the Presidio, the playground areas, I would like to have a vetting before this Commission.I do not know the correct way to do that, but we need to have some consideration here somewhere.
-There is a public hearing scheduled on July 15, I believe.I do not know if we can schedule anything before that or not.
Commissioner Olague
-We have mentioned earlier about a possible 10 o'clock hearing.We all have been requesting this for some time.
Commissioner Miguel
-I know the Presidio is not in our purview.However, it impacts many neighborhoods of the City, particularly the traffic impacts and some other impacts.
-To do it in isolation from how we plan, it is totally the wrong way to go.
Commissioner Sugaya
-Secondly, I would like to have staff take a look into the procedures for how to delist the Jessie Street Substation as a City Landmark and also to delist it from the National Register of Historic Places.
Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator
-For delisting a landmark, the procedure is the same as you would list a landmark.You would do a case report, initiate the proposal to delist the thing, bring it to the Landmarks Board, The Planning Commission, and to the Board of Supervisors.
-As far as the National Register, I am not familiar with that.
H.PUBLIC COMMENT
At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.In response to public comment, the commission is limited to:

(2)requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or
