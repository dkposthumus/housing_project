7.Commission Comments/Questions
Â·Inquiries/Announcements.Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
Â·Future Meetings/Agendas.At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Antonini
-I just wanted to point out an article in today's Chronicle commenting on the closing, at least hopefully temporarily, of the Washington Square Bar and Grill.
-In the old days, the Planning Commission used to adjourn at 2 o'clock and go there.Those were very different times because we had very short meetings.
-On restaurants in general -- I hope we are not moving to the point where we have very high end restaurants making it more difficult for what we consider middle range restaurants.
-It is important to look at businesses that are impacted by the payroll tax.Sometimes they move to other locations for that reason.
-That is another reason that we have to look at how we are handling our restaurants in terms of land use and make sure not to make it more difficult for them to stay in business here.
-This is an issue that we are hearing a lot about and it is one that we have to be sensitive to.
-There are increasing indications that many of these restaurants are looking at places outside of San Francisco to locate.
-Patrons do not just come from San Francisco and they are not just tourists.But many patrons are and can go to restaurants from other parts of the Bay Area.
-Historically, they come to San Francisco because for the quality, ambiance and many other things.But there is a point where things start to break and they move when we no longer can meet their needs.
Commissioner W. Lee
-I would like to let the Commission know that apparently Trader Vicks is shutting down off Golden Gate and that adds to some of our concerns about the economy
-I welcome new Director Rahaim and look forward to working with you.
-Thanked Larry Badiner and Amit Ghosh for the fine work done with the Commission and the public.Special thanks to Linda Avery.
-Director Rahaim, you will find sometimes that we are outside the box.However that is part of San Francisco.
-Last week I went to the website and printed a copy of the Mayor's Office of Economic and Work Force Development report on sustaining our prosperity -- San Francisco Economic Strategy was published in November 1, 2007.It is a long document.I was wondering if we could get copies from staff.
-It is very good in terms of economic forecast.It sort of points out where we are strong and weak.I would like to ask someone from the Mayor's Office to come and present it to the Planning Commission before finalizing the Eastern Neighborhoods.
-Also, can we have a budget report?As you know we are going to have a budget deficit for next year and the Mayor has asked for budget cuts.
-Regarding working with the Department of Building Inspections --I would ask Director Rahaim to meet with the Director of the Building Inspection Department and report back on what the issues are.
-I was invited by the North Beach Chamber of Commerce on December 21 to accept the APA award for what they consider great places of America and North Beach is nominated.
-One of the four director members, Jeffrey from the APA, came and presented the award to the North Beach Chamber of Commerce.
-We presented a Certificate of Honor on behalf of Mayor Newsom to the APA for giving us this great award.I would like to thank them for inviting me to accept the award on behalf of the City.
Commissioner Moore
-There were interesting articles over the holidays that you might have seen or maybe not.
-An article on January 7thon the Flower Mart saying that the Flower Mart wants its tenants out.That goes very much into our discussion and searches into what is really going on.
-Another article that is not necessarily relevant to what we are doing but it is an article on City College and the suspicion of political fundraising abuse in the 2005 campaign.Since these people are in front of us, at least some background might be of interest.
-On a more positive note:I had a good fortune this morning sitting for an hour and a half with Director Jared Blumenfeld from the San Francisco Department of the Environment and listening to the phenomenal work they are doing.
-I strongly encourage Planning, under our new leadership, for those two departments to really step up and work together in a manner that we have not seen before.
-With the Mayor's new policy for the City to be green and really leading in more ways than just green buildings, I strongly encourage that we really look at the phenomenal work that they have done.
-I have witnessed this over years on the Treasure Island Master Planning project and the sustainable guidelines for that particular project.
-I hope that we all participate more in the high qualifications of that Department and see it as two joint forces to really have a broader based discussion about green planning, green urban designs, and green building technology as an every day discussion.
-I would like to hear more substance about that once a week.
Commissioner W. Lee
-In response to Commissioner Moore's comments -- under the Department of Environment, if you look at their website, they do have a strategic plan.All Cities under the charter are required to have a strategic plan and it is very comprehensive.
-I agree that they are doing some very good work there and we have an option to look at their strategic plan or asking Jared Blumenfeld to come and present the strategic plan that goes for the next year in light of Mayor Newsom's green policy.
Commissioner Sugaya
-There is an article in the latest Bay Guardian that mentions the Planning Department and the Academy of Arts University situation.
8.Director's Announcements
John Rahaim, New Director of the Planning Department
-It is great to be here and I truly look forward to working with the Planning Commission on these very big challenges and opportunities that we have in front of us in the City.
-It is a great time to be in San Francisco.It is such a fantastic City.
-I look forward to working with staff, the Commission and the community on how to make the City even better over the next few years.

Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator
-In your packet for next week there is memorandum on the Academy of Arts.
-The Academy has requested CU on 4 or 5 projects that are life-safety issues.I just want to make this Commission aware of that.
-We are making sure that the Board of Supervisors and the Flower Mart people be made aware of it also.
-We are inclined to approve these life-safety issues that have to do with seismic safety, windows and staff like that.We will keep you informed.

CANDLESTICK/49ers PROJECT-Informational presentationon the integrated development of Candlestick Point and Parcels A-3 and B-E of the Hunters Point Shipyard.
(Continued from regular Meeting of December 20, 2007)
SPEAKER(S)
Michael Cohen, Director of Economic and Work Force Development
-For a decade, the entire city family from the Board of Supervisors, Mayor's Office, the Planning Department and the Redevelopment Agency Commission have engaged in extensive community based discussions on how to revitalize this very important site.
-With enough private investment and the thoughtful participation of the public sector, these properties can be reborn into an incredible source of parks, jobs and affordable housing.
-Because this land has been abandoned for so long, we can achieve all these public benefits without any displacement -- a real unique opportunity that this project presents.
-About two years ago, we were working with the 49ers on the idea of a stadium on Candlestick as part of a much larger mixed-use development project.
-The United States Olympic Committee invited San Francisco to submit a bid for the 2016 Olympics.That is how we came up the 49ers project idea to respond to that bid.
-There are three fundamental elements to the conceptual frame work.
-The first one is identifying policy objectives: create jobs and economic development for the entire City, build publicly accessible parks and open space, and build significant housing including affordable housing.
-The second conceptual frame work is the means to achieve these goals and objectives: the opportunity to utilize public/private partnerships because a lot of money needs to be invested.
-Finally, we were instructed to work as hard as we can to address the concern of the 49ers and to try compelling an opportunity site for them.But the conceptual frame work was very clear in saying that our first priority is to the City in general.
-This process has been incredibly transparent and has involved an extraordinary amount of public participation with regular public meetings with various associations in the community.
-We are going to the Board of Supervisors' Land Use Committee on Monday.After that we are going to meet with the community for a couple of months.
Kofi Bonner, President of the Lenard Bay Area Urban Division
-You will see a plan that in many ways is very detailed but in some ways still conceptual.There is plenty of room to define and improve this plan.
-We have had the pleasure of working with various members of your staff as well as several other departments to indeed provide that fine tuning.
David Tom, Architect
-This is a great opportunity to create jobs, educational opportunities and over time will result in something that is iconic and memorable as a unique part of San Francisco in meeting together as an extension of Bayview Hunters Point.
-This is one of the largest redevelopment areas under planning.
-[Presented a summary of the current open space and how the new series of urban parks would complete the Bay Trail]
-We started looking at extending the existing San Francisco grid.It is unique because it has a particular scale that is conducive to the pedestrian scale.
-We are trying to create a compact development and a variety of housing forms including low, middle and high rise housing.
-The first phase is targeted to replace all of the existing housing and to enable people to move from where they are and stay in the neighborhood.
-The artist community is currently somewhat isolated and it would become an integral part of the community.
-The stadium is an important piece.We are designing it in a way that enables its use as parking and also as recreational space.
-The non-stadium alternative gives us this whole notion of research and development into a broader land area.There is an opportunity to create more  green collar' employment.
-Transportation is obviously a key.We are promoting non reliance on automobiles and increasing public transportation and walking.It requires a comprehensive transportation management plan.
-The Bus Rapid Transit which runs through Candlestick provides new accessibility to the entire area.
-There would be a requirement to improve transportation and make it interchangeable.This would be a strategic move that will improve the system and the flow for accessibility.All of the roads are designed to be bike friendly.
-[Showed pictures of what this would look like with all the community benefits]
-This is an opportunity to create affordable housing, create jobs, building really good housing, and bring in things that we do not have in the Bayview like grocery stores.
(+)[No name stated]
-I hope that the level of focus for this project will be maintained because it is the greatest opportunity to address a community that has been long neglected.
(+)Al Norman, President of the Bayview Merchants
-Spoke in support of the project and encouraged the Commission to support it as well because it would support committed merchants in the area for a positive change to the growing generation.
(+)Arelious Walker, Pastor
-I fully support this project and appreciated all the work done because this is the last opportunity for the survival of the Bayview Hunters Point community.
(+)Iana Katz
-Expressed full support for this project.

INDUSTRIAL ZONE - POLICIES AND PROCEDURES- A review of policies and procedures for development proposals in industrial zoning districts as contained in Planning Commission Resolution No. 16202 and consideration of adoption of a resolution establishing additional policies and procedures for development proposals in industrial zoning districts.Includes presentation from the Western SoMa Citizens Planning Task Force regarding institutional uses within the Western SoMa planning area.
(Continued from Regular Meeting of December 20, 2007)
SPEAKER(S)
Jim Meko, Western SoMa Citizen Task Force
-There are currently interim policies in place reflecting the controls adopted by this Commission in 1999.
-In the report that staff prepared for the Board of Supervisors, they do identify the possibility of creating a special use district around the Flower Mart.We are really not interested in doing any one particular use for any one particular site.
-We are really looking at this from the perspective of comprehensive planning.
-we do have a draft community plan in progress right now.
-You are welcome to visit our website at SFGOV.ORG/Western SoMa.It is developing and it is going to be a living document.
-We hope to have our draft plan ready for your review by the middle of this year.
-We have a vision clearly developed in the Western SoMa Special Use District.
-Housing can be a threat to the preservation of small businesses.When the SLI [Service Light Industrial] district was created, market rate housing was prohibited.
-In our recommendations coming forward, we are going to ask that this area continue its prohibition on market rate housing and to include another prohibition on housing in general.
-We are also introducing the notion of the Arts proposing a name change for this district as a Service Arts and Light Industrial with the idea that arts need some zoning for survival.
(+)Sue Hestor, On behalf of the Tenants of the Flower Mart
-I urge you to adopt the amendment of Resolution 16202 as staff recommended.
-Also, I urge you to take the next step on The Academy of Arts and have the next hearing soon.
Patrick - Flower Mart
-Submitted two letters: one that came out in October saying that we needed to get out and the second one was sent out on December 26 that tells us to be out in February.
-The Academy of Arts University is saying that they are working with the tenants.There are around 22 merchants that have not been contacted.
(+)John Holden
-I ask that you impose new and true industrial protections on the zone before loosing another vital activity like the Flower Mart.
Mark Tognelli, Tenant of the Flower Mart
-The Academy of Arts has not contacted us as they are saying.They should look into the possible revitalization of underdeveloped areas for their growing institution without displacing anybody.
(-)Michael Burke, Academy of Arts Representative
-I recommend that you be cautious with these amendments because section 890.50 covers institutions like community facilities, recreation areas, childcare, religious facilities, etc.

ADMINISTRATIVE CODE – TOURIST HOTEL CONVERSION ORDINANCE – BOARD FILE 07-1528-The proposed Ordinance would amend the Administrative Code to add Section 41F prohibiting conversion of Large Tourist Hotels into condominium projects.The Ordinance would allow the Planning Commission to issue exemptions for conversion of up to 500 units in the following two year.It lists criteria for additional conversions as determined by the Planning Commission and requires applicants for exemptions to provide the Planning Department with certain information regarding the conversion. The Ordinance would be enacted with a sunset period of 10-years.Preliminary Recommendation:Approval with Amendments
SPEAKER(S)
David Noyola, Supervisor Peskin's Office
-This is not a new issue.It is permanent legislation that comes on the heels of a temporary moratorium that was extended once by the Board of Supervisors.
-The original legislation was based on a very simple premise – that it is impossible to overstate the importance of the tourism industry in San Francisco's economy and our City's character.
-Attracting visitors to our City provides for an enormous portion of our tax revenue that the City depends on every year as we prepare our budget.
-Our ability to attract conventions, specifically, is one of the pillars of that tourism industry.
-The original legislation's temporary moratorium was concerned with dealing with the new trend towards conversion of blocks of rooms in large tourist hotels that are normally available for block booking by conventions that come to town.
-The temporary moratorium has served its purpose and has shown how we ought to continue it on a permanent basis.
-We know when a large convention is in town because it is sometimes an inconvenience to us -- because we close streets on occasions but it is worth it to bring that many people to San Francisco and to bring in tax revenue.
-One of the ways to continue to be an option for conventions to come to San Francisco is to make sure that we have a stock of hotel rooms that meets the needs of the conventions.
[-]Sean Louis, Research Director for Unite Here, Local 2
-The threat here is a classic example of market failure.What is good for the individual owner if it happens on a large scale would be catastrophic for the market as a whole.
-The question is not whether a tourist can find a room but whether San Francisco can continue to compete as one of our nation's top convention cities.
-Our industry is divided roughly in thirds: tourists, individual business travelers, and convention attendees.
-The convention attendees are the most profitable segment bringing about $2 billions dollars a year to our City.
-Conventions are really a business onto itself.We are a very popular destination for visitors because of our culture, geography and history.
-We have constraints like the Moscone Center that is not big enough for those conventions.We have to protect the hospitality industry.

SPEAKER(S)
Howard H. Ngo, Owner
-I am not a condominium converter. I have been in the neighborhood for almost 20 years.
-I purchased in this location in 1997 and thought to build upstairs for housing and having my business on the ground floor.
-The project begun on September 2004 and for the first 6 months it went well.After that the project started to fall apart because the contractor was not doing his work in paying fees and sub- contractors.
-Eventually, it took 18 months to be where I am right now: with an unfinished project and a big debt.
-I had to file for Chapter 11 to protect me and gain more time to find another loan.
-No lender is willing to lend money on a rental project because there would not be enough to pay the money back.
-The only option is to convert it to condominiums in order to get the loan.Otherwise I will not be able to complete this project.
T.C. Chen, Project Sponsor
-Howard's dream is to have a nice supermarket and unfortunately the project fell apart.
-He went everywhere to look for a loan.Nobody would give him a loan on the apartments because rental is not going to provide enough money to pay the loan.
(+)Patrick Gantner
-Supported the project because the owner has been in the neighborhood for 15 years and all he wants is to clear his debt.Besides this project is well suited for that corner.
(+)Garrett Frakes
-Spoke in support of the project and requested a certain amount of consideration due to the circumstances.
(+)Josh
-Spoke in support of the project because the owner is not a developer.He is doing what he can to get back on track and get back to business.

-There are other services with no charge to the City like weddings and receptions.
-The new church's large and better design would benefit the residents of San Francisco, particularly the Sunset and the Richmond areas.
-It is located in a commercial one story building surrounded by two store office and 3 story mixed use buildings.
-[Showed photographs of the area with recent large projects and some others currently under construction]
-The construction for the Church is well designed, meets all codes and neighborhood design guidelines, and fits well with surrounding buildings.
-The Planning Department has prepared a negative declaration determining there is no significant affect and would not impact the environment negatively.Instead it would provide services to the community providing balance.
-LutheranChurchrequests that you approve this much needed project in helping the ministry and advancing its vision to better serve the community.
