-I have three items that I want to bring to the Commission's attention.
-There is a 24-page memorandum from the Department of the Environment on green building and I encourage everybody to print it out in PDF form.It is a good benchmark of where we are.
-Secondly - I attended a course on retrofitting green, which was very informational because the rest of the public really does not know where San Francisco legislation might be heading.
-Richard Cheng from the Department of the Environment was on the panel.He did a very good overview and I'd like to ask Director John and Mr. Nikitas to help set up a presentation by Mr. Cheng to the Commission to get his insight.
-I am particularly interested for all of us to get more understanding about retrofitting of green building.
-Next thing, last year the Commission was able to get free tickets to attend the Green Products exhibit.April 22 – 26, Equal City 2008 is going to be in San Francisco.
-I approached the Major's Office to help those of us commissioners who are interested to perhaps get free admission to this event.

-It was very interesting as we move into the Eastern Neighborhoods.
John Rahaim, Director
-We will get back to you on that.
Commissioner Antonini
-Conveyed thanks to Commissioners Moore and Sugaya for joining me along with Director Rahaim and Mr. Nikitas yesterday to meet in regards to design questions about a project.
-Thanks to the leadership from Commissioner Moore who took a look at the design.Maybe in the future we can take a look at designs early in the process to be more efficient.
Commissioner Moore
-I would like to just explain to the public that we are not sitting in the back room and redesigning architecture but creating a larger set of questions which frame the design and the location of architecture in a way that is really appropriate to what we are doing here.
-We are the Planning Commission and not an architecture design review board.
8.Director's Announcements
John Rahaim, Director
-Mr. Nikitas is organizing a presentation on the City's sustainability efforts.The Department of the Environment would be the focus of that but there are other departments as well.
-The building retrofit is a key issue in terms of climate protection and energy uses.
-Second thing - the issue about projects on Valencia Street and the possibility to do some design guidelines and a charrette.
-We do have funds to do what is called the Mission Public Ramp Plan as part of the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan.

C-Market – Octavia PlanSupervisor Mirkarimi recognized the work that the Commission had done in these eight years of planning efforts.Supervisor Mirkarimi, Mayor's Office, community members, advocates, property owners and Supervisor Peskin had conversations on the affects of the additional $10 fee on small developers.The result was a revision to the affordable housing fee and instead of a blanket $10 per square foot fee, the current proposal is for a tier fee structure that would apply $8 per square foot in the Van Ness – Market special use district, $4 per square foot in the neighborhood commercial district and $0 additional fee on the residential transit oriented district.
There was another new amendment this week to allow developers in the Van Ness – Market Special Use District to exceed allowable FAR between the 6 to 1 and 9 to 1 category by paying into the City's affordable housing fee instead of the TDR market.This would be set at $30 per square foot.With these amendments, the Board requested that this be sent back to the Land Use Committee for additional comments and they further requested that amendments be sent to the Planning Commission for your review and comments as a professionally courtesy.
Staff has been working with President Olague and the Commission's Secretary to get this scheduled on you calendar for next week.The Board Committee will re-hear that item on March 24.
