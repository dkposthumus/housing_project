The proposed project would involve conversion of the television antennas on Sutro Tower from the current combination of analog and digital to an all-digital system. Project components would include: 1) replacement of nine existing analog main antennas at the top of Sutro Tower with no more than five digital main antennas; 2) structural upgrades to the tower to enable the tower to meetBuilding Codewind resistance requirements for an  essential facility  and to accommodate the placement of new digital television equipment on the tower; 3) removal of four digital main television antennas; 4) removal of nine analog auxiliary television antennas and installation of three digital auxiliary antennas; 5) alteration, replacement, or addition of small ancillary and accessory antennas and equipment associated with the operation of Sutro Tower broadcasters; and 6) addition of auxiliary equipment, and electrical, elevator, and public safety improvements associated with the proposed project. The project would result in an overall net reduction of approximately 14 television antennas, from 22 to 8 antennas. There would be no expansion of the tower itself or the ancillary buildings at the base of the tower.
Note: Written comments will be accepted at the Planning Department's offices until the close of business on July 1, 2008.

Susan Keeney
-The primary failing of the Draft Environmental Report is the block of attention to the fact that the existing facility already meets the needs of those who rely on broadcast television signal in the digital format.
-We need to balance the welfare of the residents against the needs for Sutro Towers.
Thomas Le
-Requested more time to review because the neighborhood has had little time to evaluate the report.It is a rather complex document.

505-525 Howard Street- south side between 1stand 2ndStreets, Lots 114 and 121 of Assessor's Block 3736 -Request for Allocation of Square Footageunder the Annual Office Development Limitation Program. The proposed project is to demolish an existing one-story commercial building and construct a new 11-story building containing approximately 252,500 square feet of office uses and approximately 9,500 square feet of ground-floor retail space. The proposal is a modification/expansion of a previously-approved 178,000 square-foot office building for this site. The previous project was approved with other office buildings, all of which comprise the "Foundry Square" office development project. This expanded project would be the last of the four buildings to be constructed. The project site is located within a C-3-O (SD) Zoning District, and the 200-S and 350-S Height and Bulk Districts. The Planning Department has made an initial determination that 228,500 square feet of the proposed office uses would be subject to the requirements of the Downtown Park Special Fund, Housing for Large-Scale Development, and Child-Care for Office and Hotel Development Projects.

17.Commission Comments/Questions
Â·Inquiries/Announcements.Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
Â·Future Meetings/Agendas.At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Antonini
-In the last couple of months we have heard a lot about the development of the area that is adjacent to Mission Bay and right across the bridge from the Giant's Ballpark.
-We have seen a number of plans that have come through and what I am hearing is that two of these are being proposed.There are a number of options that have been brought forward.
-One of the plans, I believe, spoke to the possibility of some sort of an arena in the area.I believe it was fairly small in capacity.
-Recently I had the occasion to go back to Indianapolis and was very impressed with what they did there with a place called the Canseco Field House.
-They architectural did something that looks a little bit more traditional than the arenas we have seen and fitted very well within the neighborhood.Everyone there is very impressed with it.
-It would be my feeling that I would be very encouraging of project sponsors for the various projects to try to include in their site an arena that would be large enough to accommodate the needs of larger concerts, perhaps an NBA or NHL team to go up to that 18 to 20,000 seats.
-The site is big enough to include that kind of thing and still provide mixed use housing.
-We see how it is working with the Giant's Stadium - that people can reach the Mission Bay on foot or by using Muni and with the growth of Mission Bay, you rarely see any kind of problems with people arriving or dispersing from the games.
Commissioner Miguel
-The Sunday's June 8thNew York Times Magazine had an interesting architect issue on the next city.I suggest everyone taking a look at it because it is interesting.
-Last Sunday had in its letters a reply from an individual in London referring to a book The Next City' by Nicolai Ouroussoff.
-Nicolai Ouroussoff, (The New, New City) puts forth - "Why not start by designing cities based on metrics we know to be relevant, regardless of country, continent or creed:the finite distance people are willing to walk to work, the distance a child playing can be herd through an open window, the width of sidewalks necessary for ease of movement and public exchange, street dimensions that prioritize people over traffic.There is more to these principles than the vagaries of style.
-This was from a Letter to the Editor by Andrew Salzberg, London in the New York Times Magazine, 6/22/08 in response to the Times  The Next City  feature article, 6/8/08.
Director Rahaim
-Nicolai Ouroussoff is the architectural critic of The New York Times.
Commissioner Borden
-I just wanted to take this opportunity to introduce myself to my fellow Commissioners and also to the viewing public.
-I am honored to serve among you and look forward to all that I would learn from you and the time that I will get to spend on the Commission.
-I love San Francisco and the opportunity to serve on the Commission that frames how the City looks and grows in the future is extremely exciting.
-My passion is for neighborhoods.And what makes San Francisco so great is the vitality and the strength of our neighborhoods providing enough stock and amenities.
Commissioner Olague
-I want to thank the appointing body with the Mayor's Office for appointing a woman of a color.The African-American community has not been represented here since the departure of Commissioner Alexander.
-Welcome and we look forward to working with you.
Commissioner Moore
-1960, San Francisco Planning Department – The City of Gold[book].Some of the names in that book are quite familiar to me, except that all Planning Commissioners were men.I am really glad to welcome Ms. Borden because we have now three women.
-I want to bring to your attention an article which I really want us to think more of and that is  SF firm finds fresh potential unused lands.That is an idea of urban gardens and urban farming.
-When we are talking about neighborhood open space and the money that Park and Recreation Department does not have to maintain the parks, why not actively think about urban farming as we plan?
-It is a great supplement for the money you have to go by organic food, but also urban gardens are maintained by neighborhoods.
-I would like us, as a group, to take a look at it.
Commissioner Miguel
-I would like to welcome the new Commissioner.I really appreciate you coming on board.
Commissioner Sugaya
-A quick question to staff; on some of these environmental reports and other documents that I think are in the department somewhere - should we be giving these back to you?
Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator
-You may give those back to us.We can certainly use them in our library.
Commissioner Olague
-I really appreciate Commissioner Moore's comments about the urban gardening and I am hoping too that we can start that in relationship to all the new neighborhood plans that we are reviewing.
-Also, Sunday's Chronicle had a cover story on the exodus of the middle class in San Francisco.
-I think that at some point it might be good to have a special hearing on the subject of families.What does it mean really when we talk about family housing, requiring larger units in certain developments?What are the types of the things they are requiring or looking for in housing?Would that include schools, open spaces, urban gardens?
-I think there is a lot that we need to look at.
If we do ultimately calendar that hearing, perhaps we can have someone from the school system, Coleman Advocates, and DCYF [Department of Children Youth and Families]
Commissioner Borden
-That is a great idea because we see an exodus of families of all income levels and that is very unfortunate.We need to look at parks, open space, schools, neighborhood commercial corridors, whether or not they have the types of businesses that support families.
-The second thing is the urban gardens.The woman that the article mentioned doing a urban garden in her backyard is a friend of mine.It is a very exciting initiative.
-I have also been involved in a garden in Bay View Hunter's Point and I know the difference it makes in the lives of the young people that work in that garden.I definitely recommend that we do something like that.
Commissioner Antonini
-Welcomed Commissioner Borden.
-What is really an important point is that we have to ask the people who are leaving what it is that they want in housing.Is it cost, price or other factors?
-It does not make a lot of sense to build a lot of housing even if it is at a reasonable price and find out that families are not going to stay anyway because it is not acceptable to what they need for their families.
-I would encourage, if we have that hearing, to have members of the San Francisco Department of Police, Fire, Public Safety and all the types of groups that we talk about like teachers, personnel of various types of businesses throughout San Francisco and try to get leaders to hear their comments about the types of things we can do as we approve housing to make it more family friendly.
Commissioner Olague
-I would like to understand who has jurisdiction over HOA fees. [Home Owners Association]
Commissioner Sugaya
-If we are going to have a special hearing, before inviting people someone needs to set forward what it is that we are trying to get to.
-It is fine to hear statistics but the Commission needs to sort of sit down and say within the jurisdiction that we have we are looking to do something that is regulatory in conjunction with the Mayor's Office of Housing.That way we can have a more focused discussion.
18.Director's Announcements
Director Rahaim
-Welcomed Commissioner Borden to the Commission.
-The National AIA Convention is in San Francisco at the end of April 2009.The deadline for submitting proposals for sessions is next Tuesday.The Planning Department is in the process of submitting three proposals and we are not sure that all are going to be accepted.
-The Charter Amendment – The creation of the Landmark's Board Commission.Supervisor Peskin did make a revised draft of the Charter amendment last Friday.You received a memorandum from us.The latest draft does include some of our staff's proposed revisions but not all of them.There are still discussions on it and they are scheduled to take it up at the Rules Committee tomorrow.
-The Budget Committee of the Board of Supervisors approved the Department's Budget yesterday and two of the four positions that we had initially proposed for lay-offs were restored.Thanked the Board for their vote.
19.Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
AnMarie Rodgers reported:
Land Use Committee
A-Urgency Ordinance that would extend interim moratorium on enterprises that sell tobacco pharaphenilia– It would be extended for six additional months.As an urgency ordinance this item was not referred to the department or the Commission.If permanent controls are developed, those would come to you before implementation.
B-Eastern Neighborhoods Plan Hearing– The Committee heard what you heard in your last week's hearing.
C-Three Charter Amendemts– Music and Culture Amendment.It seems that Supervisor Mirkarimi may be interested in amending that Charter Amendment in response to this Commission's resolution.It is likely to be modified that the Charter Amendment would require Planning Code consistency with the Charter Amendment but still would not alter the Planning Commission's role as the sole author of the General Plan.
Full Board
A-Parking and Off-street Loading– Sponsored by Supervisor Peskin.When this was before you, you recommended two technical clean-ups and two policy changes:one to expand the definition of space efficient parking to include tandem parking where no more than one car needed to move and (2) to allow residential accessory parking to also be rented to neighbors.All of the amendments were incorporated into the final legislation.Passed
B-Introductions:
a.901 Bush StreetSpecial Use District was formally introduced by the Board
b.Creation of New Mission – Harrington Special Use District introduced by Supervisor Sandoval.This is in the 400 Mission Street block and it would contain a parcel on that area.
