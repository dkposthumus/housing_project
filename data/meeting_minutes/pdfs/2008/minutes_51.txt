7.Director's Announcements
Director Rahaim
-Congratulated Commissioner Miguel.
-I just want to let you know that we will be coming to you sometime in June with a series of what I am calling process improvements to the Department's operations, primarily using the Matrix Report which you heard back in March.
-A couple of items are moving ahead now.One is the recent legislation you recommended to the Board that is now in effect on the Administrative Fee for Code Enforcement.It took place last week.
-Another one related to the Environmental Review process is that we are trying to expand the pool of consultants that do those reviews.The Department has worked with the City Attorney's Office and we have issued a RFP for consultants.
-The process will be such that we will, for projects requiring consultants help, select three consultants, and from that pool the project sponsor will have the option of choosing from those three.We will be using that pool for private and City planned projects.
-Next week there is an informational meeting for potential respondents to that.
-The other item that I want to let you know about is that we have issued the Draft of the Better Streets Plan that staff has been working on for some time.
-June 5this the public release of that plan.Shortly after that, we will get it on the Commission's calendar as well as do a follow up with a presentation to you about that plan.

-The compositional strategy of the project is similar to other buildings within the district; it has three part vertical divisions.
-[Explained the design of the building and features]
Sue Hestor, Attorney for residents at 333 Grant Avenue
-The issues that my clients raised were not so much of the architectural details but the mass of the building as it affects projects, residents, and hotels that are on this block.There was nothing indicating that has been addressed at all.
-Requested clarification of what the structure would be for this project because it seems that they are coming twice to the Commission.The developer is having two chances to present their case.
Linda Mjellem, Union Square Association
-Our association does support this project because we think that the sponsor's efforts and attempts to respond to the various concerns have been extraordinary.
Pamela Duffy

Jim Salinas

The three existing commercial buildings on the project site proposed for demolition include a retail shop (Aqua Surf Shop), restaurant/cafÃ© (John's Ocean Beach CafÃ©), and a motel (Robert's Motel).The project site is within the NC-2 (Small-Scale Neighborhood Commercial) zoning district and a 100-A height and bulk district.
Preliminary Recommendation: Uphold Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration
(Continued from Regular Meeting of April 24, 2008)
SPEAKER(S)
Marc Duffett, Appellant
-We filed the appeal in order to offer some of the immediate neighbors a chance to voice their concerns regarding the environmental impacts.
-The main problems we saw were the overwhelming massing of the Wawona Street faÃ§ade, the lack of attention paid to the flow of traffic around the site, and the demand for increase of short-term commercial and long-term residential parking in the area.
-The project sponsor requested a meeting with the MTA where I was able to present my ideas on necessary improvements to traffic patterns and parking.I will present the particulars of that plan during the conditional use hearing.
George Mayer
-The environmental impact report should not be undertaken if analysis has not been completed on the impact of under ground parking on the Aqua First that supplies water to Lake Merced.
Margarete Lee
-The proposed plans are excessive and should fully comply with the City's Zoning, and Planning Code before it can continue.She submitted a signed community petition of more than 200 signatures requesting the developers to scale back their plans.
Mike Shawa
-We do not agree with this project to have 56 units and commercial uses on a very small lot in a residential area.
Burt Gabriel
-The environmental report should have been done by a third party and not by the Planning Department.
Patrick Maguire
-Many developers come to the community and leave us with ugly projects and they leave with the money.This developer has come with integrity.
Joel Schechter
-Requested a new environmental review because the existing document is inadequate and insufficient in certain areas.
Mary Anne Miller, SPEAK
-Our intention of appealing the negative declaration was to get more information into the document.
-I am disappointed that there were no graphics, as we requested, that would show the two-story height and elevation versus the five stories on Wawona Street.
Michael Jason
-The negative declaration says that approximately 274 parking spaces will be needed and they came up with only 93.It is bringing more people in the area and not enough parking.
[No name stated]
-Concerned that the height would impact natural light.Also, are they going to use union carpenters? What about affordable housing that is much needed in the City?
Jess
-There is not a building out there that is this tall.This area is not downtown.
Rachel Hamilton, Architect
-It seems that parking is the mayor issue and we have tried to mitigate that.We are committed to install parking lifts on the residential portion.We negotiated with MTA and DPT to introduce diagonal parking along 47thAvenue between Wawona and Sloat.
ACTION:Following public hearing, the item was continued indefinitely to expand the negative declaration to address issues on parking, transportation, and density and for staff to consider moving this into a full environmental impact report.

-Given the many factors that we have tried to juggle, we think we are submitting a well set up proposal that would be an asset to any mixed use area in San Francisco.
-We are in keeping with the character of the neighborhood.
(+)Owen Kennerly, Architect

(Continued from Regular Meeting of April 24, 2008)
SPEAKER(S)
Jimmy Chan, 1stDiscretionary Review Requestor
-The design is going to have a lot of impact to me because its roof deck is right on the mid-block open space and it is kind of awkward.It does not match with the rest of the buildings.
-If someone stands on the roof deck, they can look at all my bedrooms--invading my privacy.It should be setback six (6) feet.
-Another concern is the front design that sticks out three (3) feet, invading privacy to my dining room.
Joe Donehill, 2ndDiscretionary Review Requestor Representative
-The backyards are supposed to be the essence of the neighborhood, not the decks.
-Move the roof deck back six (6) feet and ensure that there is a stairway from the garage to the first floor.
-You should add another condition for inspection once a year.We need enforcement to ensure the integrity of the RH-1 and RH-2 districts.
(-)Joanna Felder
-It is important that we look at the impacts on the neighborhood character and green space.With the proposed project we would loose a lot of open space, light, and peace at the end of the day.
(-)Rose Tsai
-Raised and read a letter that listed concerns about the height of the proposed building and it not being in keeping with our neighborhood.
(-)Betty Larson
-Consider the elimination of the deck in the back; pull back the back perimeter of the house and prevent any bay windows from being built on the back that would impact the privacy of the neighbors.
Sean Han, Project Sponsor
-I made changes to the frontage and lowered the deck to accommodate the requestors' concerns.
-[Showed photographs of buildings in the area stating that his property is smaller]
ACTION:Took Discretionary Review and approved as modified:
-NSR

SPEAKER(S)
Michael Bruce, Project Sponsor
-The house is dilapidated and the structure suffers from dry rot.
-We need the three bedrooms because our family is growing.We are expecting twins.

(+)Michael Leva, Co-Owner
-We met with the neighbors twice and have tried very hard to work with them because we love the neighborhood.
(+)Tim, Architect
-The proposed design has an architectural base element lodged into a hill side.
-The design is composed of three basic elements:base, wall, and roof working together in a cohesive fashion to create visual balance.
-The 11 foot ceiling would most likely to be dropped 14 – 18 inches for mechanical ducting.
-We have set back the new building 5 feet from the side lot line.
(+)Brett Gladstone
-The height of the building is indeed way below the height limit and the set back was created even though they could have built to the side lot line.

-The project speaks for itself and I just want to let you know that I am available to answer any questions you may have about the soundness report or construction costs.
Clifford Anderson
-Although we are taking a neutral position at this point, you developed guidelines that we encourage our neighbors to engage on projects such as this one and compromise to minimize impacts on key elements that must be considered as projects affect sun, light and air to nearby residents.

Presentation from the Mayor's Office of Economic and Workforce Development on business and workforce development strategies related to the Eastern Neighborhoods
SPEAKER(S)
Michael Cohen, Director of Mayor's Office of Economic and Workforce Development
-Our work has been guided by two regards:The City's economic plan and hard data gathered for the economic plan and specifically for our work around the Eastern Neighborhoods.
-Key economic and planning objectives of the plan are: (a) to protect economically viable PDR sectors that provide relatively high wages for people with less than a 4-year degree, (b) to protect viable PDR sectors that provide support of the City's economic drivers, (c) protection of the predominant industrial character of the areas for both practical and aesthetic reasons, and (d) preserve land to accommodate the next generation of innovative industries.
Michael Yarni, Director of Economic Development
-[Gave examples of four small businesses in the City that are growing]
-These are examples and they want PDR flexibility within the Eastern Neighborhoods to accommodate any small business person needing affordable small space.
RwandaSimmons, Director of Workforce Development
-We are two years old and we are moving towards an outcome driven workforce system.The notion of providing quality assurance is high on our list.
-Workforce sectors in the City are construction, health care, transportation, hospitality, information technology, retail, and biotech.
-San Francisco is considered a  smart city.51% of the residents have BA degrees and the other 49% is a different mix with about 16% not having a high school diploma, 39% have some college but no degree or certificate.
-Being able to look at wages across a wide spectrum of skill sets with the ability to access different paths to move about is important in my business.
Brett Gladstone
-Asked for more flexibility on the PDR along 16thStreet and Alabama Street [Lion's Building]
EaganTurp, SPUR
-I found useful the particular examples that were given of specifics companies.We want to make sure that those kinds of firms as they evolve would stick around.
Bill Lightern
-I would like you to consider how expensive it is to build these buildings and why small businesses can not compete with traditional office and residential uses.
Chris Haorny
-I am here to say that the new plan needs to be very flexible.
Jim Meko
-Obviously the most important thing that needs to be solved in the Eastern Neighborhoods process is the need for affordable housing above and beyond anything else.
-I am glad that we are beginning to talk about job opportunities as well.
-The mix of uses is what describes the essence of San Francisco.Light industrial, commercial, retail, arts, and innovative industry is what describes San Francisco.
-I am encouraged that the Mayor's Office of Economic Development is trying to broaden this discussion a little bit beyond PDR.
Fred Snyder
-This plan is not really meeting the needs of what it is in the field.Many of the uses are becoming non-conforming.
Jim
-Acquired a lot on Potrero Hill for a business that is proposed for a height limit of 45 feet while just across the street it is 60 feet.The whole area should have a 60 foot height limit.
Eric Quezada, Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition
-There is a conflict between last weeks' presentation and today's because we should not try to define what office space is but the preservation of classic/traditional PDR.
Judy West
-Reminded the Commission of the economic issues that the artists are facing with seismic upgrades right now and seismic impacts that are not being considered in any of the Eastern Neighborhoods.
Peter Cohen
-The trick is how to really grow the economy and all its various sectors into the future while thinking about that in terms of workforce.
Nick Pagaulatos
-As Ken Rich said at the last hearing, the real challenge is not try to move San Francisco back to its industrial past but to really manage the piece of change.
-We need to plan for the unknown by paying attention to what we know.PDR is still a vital industry in San Francisco.
Jim Allen
-Echoed all the comments about flexibility.Do not consider people that went through every process to get permitted as non-conforming without some kind of protection.
Tony Kelly, Potrero Boosters
-We support the overlay district in the Central Waterfront but are strongly opposed to the innovative industry overlay in Showplace Square.
Mike Ghallager
-Regulations on how you are doing this plan have run out of the City one of the few hopes we have for the motion/picture industry.
Phil Lesser
-We all believe that we need to have PDR in San Francisco because we are one of the most technological advance places in the world and we need to keep that going.The question is where?
Jeffrey Leibovitz
-I have visited Vancouver and they are victims of their success now.They are so successful on residential that they have no place for jobs.
-We need to take into consideration jobs and where to put them in relationship to where we build the housing as well.
Greg Miller
-We are engaged in a difficult policy debate, not about whether to preserve industrial land but really how much to set aside and where that should be.

Western SoMa Citizens Planning Task ForceStrategic Analysis Memos- The final informational presentation of the Western SoMa Strategic Analysis Memos.This presentation covers the analysis of existing conditions forEconomicsandPreservationfor the Western SoMa Special Use District.These Strategic Analysis Memos provide background and analysis of conditions considered by the Task Force during the formulation of policy recommendations for a community plan that will be presented to the Planning Commission in July 2008.
SPEAKER(S)
Toby Levy, Vice-Chair of the Western SoMa Citizen Taskforce
-We started with the ideas of incorporating these principles from the start of our plan.
-When we are looking about the historic context that it is done in terms of the largest South of Market and not only SoMa.We thought of them as not only the preservation of buildings and structures but actually the culture and its residents.
-Western SoMa was settled by the Native American Indians and later by the Spanish settlers with ranchers that grouped by the time of the gold rush.
-It has been mostly working class through its history from the gold rush until today.
-The mixture was destroyed in the earthquake; in fact, there were very few buildings that survived the earthquake.Our historic buildings were actually rebuilt after the earthquake.
-When it was rebuilt [Mission Creek], it was rebuilt with a mixture of industrial warehouses and commercial buildings that supported the port and the industry in downtown.The residential structures were small in scale and often mixed in with the commercial buildings.
-The taskforce is thinking about preservation of culture, people, as well as structures.
-We are looking to complete our survey of historic resources.We want to have a policy that encourages new affordable housing that would have supportive services to sort of keep the members of the communities to live in South of Market.
-We wish to preserve existing housing stock and identify community benefits that would go to the support and retention to core culture assets.
Jim Meko, Chair of the Taskforce
-We spent almost the first year of the life of the taskforce concentrating on understanding what our vision and values were.It took almost a year to set down planning principles.
-The second and third year, we asked a lot of questions.
-The strategic analysis memorandums are basically the product of all the questions we had.I hope this is helpful to you before beginning to present the plan to you.
-When we do release the plan in June, I look forward to a conversation about our principles, questions, and the implementation of the Western SoMa Community Plan.
Anthony
-They did a great job.
Ingrid Aquino
-Thanked all the West SoMa Taskforce for the wonderful report.
Gus Kiper, Arts Taskforce
-The preservation of PDR and industrial space is essential for me as an individual and citizen of San Francisco to have the opportunity to find a job and to afford a place to live here.
-I am hoping that there is communication and dialogue in preservation and usage; to have a comprehensive plan to go forward.
Peter Cohen
-What you saw tonight were some things that were made up as ways to answer questions that this planning taskforce came up with.This is one of the interesting and neat things about this.
-It would be great to see if there were some good methods that come out of it to use those again because you are able to get some very fine grained insights that you can not get through a lot of typical planning analysis.
