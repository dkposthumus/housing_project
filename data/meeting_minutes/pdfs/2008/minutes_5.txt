B.COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS(Tape IA)
9.Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Lee
Commissioner Antonini
-I made some comments this morning during our hearing on greening but I think they are worthy of re-mentioning and that is in regards to the situation that was described in an article on SPUR in contrast of the payroll tax in San Francisco in comparison with other cities in the Bay Area.
-That was very striking that ours being an average of $61,000 compared to $8,000 in Oakland, $4,000 in San Jose.
-Obviously, there are instances where in some of these other jurisdictions they do some other tax methods but I think that is an alarming figure.
-In that same thing, there was a proposal circulating to have a greening tax that might be able to be used to displace some of this and the advantage with that is there might be more control in keeping businesses in San Francisco.
-I think this other idea presents some alternatives and we have to look at it.
Commissioner Moore
-I just want to add a little comment to Commissioner Lee's idea about the model.
-I have seen the model and worked with it.This model is probably at a cost of $4 or $5 million dollars.
-It would be a great idea but in the way that models are built here, that is a far shot and I want to protect our Friends of San Francisco Planning.
Commissioner Olague
-I would like to know the schedule of the Market – Octavia Plan before [inaudible] Advisory Committee.
10.Director's Announcements
Director Rahaim
-We had the latest series of meetings on the Transit Center Plan about a week and a half ago.
-The way we are structuring those meetings is that as we develop additional thoughts on that plan, we are having the public meetings to get public reaction.
-This meeting was about certain urban design and streetscape proposals, building form proposals, retail requirements and that sort of things.
-We are still on schedule to have the draft plan for the Transit Center to complete by the end of the year and then we will spend several months taking public comments.
-The Draft EIR is due next June at the end of the draft planning process.We will be coming back to the Commission next month and there would be another public meeting in November.
-There have been two hearings on the Eastern Neighborhoods at the Land Use Committee, one on PDR issues and one on housing.
-You had asked for an additional hearing on The Presidio Trust and Master Plan.The only date that works for your schedule is October 16 and the Presidio is not able to make that date.
-Our suggestion, and we talked to President Olague about this, is to schedule time on next week to discuss a draft of a letter that you would send to the Trust.
-We are drafting that letter now and will have it in your packet.The content would be based on the comments that you all made at the hearing that we had on this.
-Other internal things:MEA [Major Environmental Analysis] of the Department has issued new guideline to consultants on how they are to do their work.
-Those were issued on September 11 and they are guidelines for consultants preparing the CEQA documents.They are attempting to standardize the way we do the documents.
-Tomorrow morning I am making some opening comments at a conference that is sponsored by the Urban Land Institute on transit oriented development.
-You should have received invitations that the week after next we are sponsoring a week long visit by Jon Gahl, urban designer from Denmark, who is doing some work for us in the department.
-We are scheduling a series of meetings and workshops with him.We will send you more details on those.
