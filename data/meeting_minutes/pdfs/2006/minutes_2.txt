C.DIRECTOR'S REPORT
Amit Ghosh, Chief Planner
-The entire program was videotaped.The video is also available on our Planning web page.
8.Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
Larry Badiner - Zoning Administrator
Board of Supervisors
The amendments would expand the eligibility to contributory buildings within our historic districts - Category 1 through 4 in Downtown Conservation Districts - and would increase the eligibility to approximately 2000 properties.We hope to see more active use of the Mills Act, which is a strong tool for preservation.
-It was thought that they were saturated at the time that the zoning went through.
-This Upper Fillmore District and two other districts, one of them is the Castro, in the preamble talks about that in order to preserve the equilibrium of the neighborhood, new restaurants are not permitted.
-Now, there are other districts where new restaurants are not permitted, but only three districts use the phrase equilibrium.
-I issued a determination saying that I do not think that is significantly different than anything else.
-The fact is that the way we have always treated these is a new restaurant is not permitted.
-You can move a restaurant but once one goes out of business another one can not come in.
-In the Upper Fillmore, to use an example, there were 35 restaurants in 1997 when we passed this.Now there are 27 restaurants because new restaurants have not been permitted.
-The Board of Appeals overruled me and said the equilibrium language was very important.
-If you've reduced the number or restaurants since then, the equilibrium has been changed and you can go back up to that level that was there before.
-I think staff and I are going to look at the other three districts.I think we can probably pull together the figures about what was there when it was originally approved in 1997.
-We have a survey from 1985 and we will use that.
-It is conceivable that in two or three districts where we have been saying since the controls came in that new restaurants are not permitted, some new restaurants may now be permitted and they may go up to the level that was there in 1997.
-The other districts I do not know.They may still be at that level.It may make no difference.
-In the Fillmore it could be four to six new restaurants that could come in.
-I will keep you apprised as we do that work.

-T-Mobile is proposing to install six antennas and three equipment cabinets on the rooftop.
-All the antennas will be flush mounted to a mechanical penthouse.The antennas will be screened and painted to match the penthouse.
-The building was chosen as a primary candidate in this area because it provides adequate height to meet the proper objectives and the installation could be designed to be visually unobtrusive.
-This proposed installation would enhance T-Mobile's ability to provide its customers with consistent and reliable coverage along commercial streets.
-The report produced for this site concludes that under the admission guidelines of the SCC and the San Francisco Department of Health, exposure levels would be less than one percent at ground level and on any of the adjacent rooftops.
