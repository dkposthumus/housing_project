C.DIRECTOR'S REPORT
7.Director's Announcements
Larry Badiner – Board of Permit Appeal
1420 Haight Street– a case where the project sponsor had put in an addition for an elevator penthouse in the rear without proper permits - and also would require a variance.The Commission acted and denied that building permit.I, in my independent capacity as Zoning Administrator, disagreed with you.And that is very unusual.I granted the variance. The Board upheld the variance 4 –0.They overturned the Discretionary Review and approved the building permit 4 –0.Commissioner Albright was absent.
231 Ortega– This is a project that you have seen many times, starting in 2003.It is a demolition permit.The Commission denied the application.Most recently it was before you with the adjacent property owner represented by Ms. Hestor and a Structural Engineer where we had a discussion about how much of the building could actually be safe.Staff recommended that the addition to the rear be reduce in length.The project sponsor did not want to do that.The Commission decision was that this was not retaining any thing in any real sense because the building had a side set back.The Board agreed with you in large park, but did decided to continue it for two months.
Dan Sider – Board of Supervisors
24thNoe Valley Restaurant – an ordinance proposed by Supervisor Dufty to allow full service restaurants and limit full liquor license along 24thStreet.The Commission reviewed this on December 8 and approved it unanimously.The Land Use Committee agreed with the Commission and agreed to send it to the full Board.
