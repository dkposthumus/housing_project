B.COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
3.Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Antonini
-I received the housing inventory for the city and I thought it would be good to comment on it.
-Some points are made on the need for low income housing for residents.
-They quote that there were only 3,999 very low-income units built in San Francisco for the last 10 years.
-Our housing inventory says that 3,196 units were built in 2005 of this number 14 percent were for medium income.
-I looked for the projects in the pipeline and we have projected 3,200 affordable units and 5,400 market-rate units.
-I wonder why we have these differences on these numbers.
-What the City inventory does not address is that last year we only built 46 single-family homes.
-We have to be really grounded on what has been happening as we go forward.
Commissioner Sugaya
-I think we all received the internal memorandum with respect to the reorganization and additions of the new department staff with the managers that were added to the department recently.
Commissioner Antonini
-We did send a letter to the Board of Supervisors – to the attention to Supervisors Maxwell and McGoldrick.
-It asked that, as requested, we have a public hearing on community improvements for the Eastern Neighborhoods.
Commissioner Moore
-I would like for us to get an update on the Environmental Impact Report, the California Environmental Quality Act and all processes dealing with environmental review.
