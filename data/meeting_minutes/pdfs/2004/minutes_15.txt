SPEAKER(S):
Re:  Continuance
Curtis Eisenberger - Mission Coalition on Justice and Jobs
- He is in favor of the continuance.
- He thanked members of staff who helped to open up the process.
- There has not been an opportunity to meet with the interested parties.  The current regulations are flawed so time is needed to work on these.
Fred Snyder
- He is also in favor of the continuance.
- He submitted a package to the Commission wherein he states some concerns.
- More time is needed to follow through.
- He echoed what Ms. Hestor said about a quick turn around on items.
- No maps have been established.
Toby Levine
- She welcomed the new Commissioner.
- She agrees with the continuance.
- There are serious flaws in this.  Zoning is just an informational tool when goals have been set.
- The mapping is wrong and needs to be redone.
- There are aspects of a flawed process.
- It is important to look at this again and fix what is wrong.
Judy Berkowitz
- She agrees with the continuance.
- There are questions that have to be answered.
- It is important to have at least several meetings.
Milton Gaines
- He agrees with the continuance.
- When he submitted data, block by block, about 29 of the blocks were non-conforming.

B. COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
5.  Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Bradford Bell:
Re: Eastern Neighborhoods
- There was a request for public information on this project.
- Was this information provided?
- Apparently the request for the information was met after the deadline of October 20 and all the information was not submitted.
- She wants to know what the information is that staff believes to be proprietary and cannot be given out to the public.  Can this information be given to Commissioners?
- She requested the City Attorney present this information next week.
Larry Badiner responded:
- He believes that staff has given out as much information as possible.
- There was some delay while the two different groups of staff coordinated.
- They did provide the information required when it was asked for.
- There is some financial information that has been determined proprietary by Dun and Bradstreet.
- Some members of the public still believe that there is some information that has not been made public.
William Lee
Re:   Role of Planning Commission
- He has had an opportunity to speak with staff to find out what staff requires from the Commission and the conclusion was that it is important that members of the Planning Commission speak to staff regarding the cases before the meetings.
Commissioner Antonini:
Re:  Eastern Neighborhoods
- He requested that staff monitor the meetings that will be held between the stake holders interested in the Eastern Neighborhoods.
Larry Badiner responded:
- He assured the Commission that he and Interim Director Macris will monitor the meetings that will be held for the Eastern Neighborhoods.
Commissioner Olague:
Re:  Eastern Neighborhoods
- She was curious to know what Long Range Planning's role is in the Eastern Neighborhoods.
Larry Badiner responded:
- Long Range Planning is still assigned to the Eastern Neighborhoods.
- They have been invited to the meetings but have not shown up.
Commissioner Sue Lee:
Re:  Commissioner Calendar
- She just realized that two meetings in November are cancelled and the pending items in December are quite a lot.
- It is important to manage the calendars more efficiently.  Perhaps adding a December 16 meeting is necessary to take care of cases that have been languishing and have been continued from meeting to meeting.
Commissioner Antonini:
Re:  Commissioner Calendar
- He also agrees with adding a meeting back to the schedule.
C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT
6. Director's Announcements

Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions.

16a. 2002.0928CEV                                                  (D. DIBARTOLO:  (415) 558-6291)
7-11 VANDEWATER STREET (AKA 9 VANDEWATER) AND 418-420 FRANCISCO STREET- a through lot between Powell and Mason Streets; Lots 009 and 019 in Assessor's Block 0041 -Request for Conditional Use authorization to merge two assessor's lots into one single lot greater than 5,000 square feet per Section 722.11 of the Planning Code. The proposal is to demolish two existing one story commercial structures at the Vandewater Street frontage and to construct a new four-story building with nine dwelling units over a garage. The project retains the existing two-story mixed-use structure on Francisco Street by rehabilitating the façade and adding a new partial third floor. The existing residential unit would remain and occupy the two-story space above the approximately 900 square foot ground floor commercial space that would also be retained. The Zoning Administrator at this concurrent public hearing will also consider a rear yard modification and variance request, within the North Beach Neighhood Commercial District (NCD) and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with conditions.
SPEAKER(S):

- He is available for questions.

7-11 VANDEWATER STREET (AKA 9 VANDEWATER) AND 418-420 FRANCISCO STREET- a through lot between Powell and Mason Streets; Lots 009 and 019 in Assessor's Block 0041 -Requests for Variances. The proposal is to merge two assessor's lots into one single lot greater than 5,000 square feet; to demolish two existing one story commercial structures at the Vandewater Street frontage; and to construct a new four-story building with nine dwelling units over a garage. The project retains the existing two-story mixed-use structure on Francisco Street by rehabilitating the façade and adding a new partial third floor. A rear yard modification is sought under Section 134 (e) to provide a rear yard open space within an inner court. A variance is sought from dwelling unit exposure requirements, as the horizontal dimensions of the inner court do not meet the requirements for an open area as defined under Section 140 (a)(2) for dwelling unit exposure, and six of the ten units have no exposure other than this inner court.  The site is within the North Beach Neighborhood Commercial District (NCD) and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
SPEAKER(S): Same as those listed for item 16a.
ACTION: The Zoning Administrator closed the public hearing and has taken the matter under advisement.

The proposal is to alter a mezzanine story within an existing 20-foot tall commercial structure and to add two additional floors to the building, resulting in an approximately 40-foot tall, four-story building.
