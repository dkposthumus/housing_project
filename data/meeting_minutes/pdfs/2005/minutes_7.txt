BOA -
Re:  1234 19thAvenue

(did not state name) - SPEAK
Re:  1234 19thAvenue - Heard at the Board of Appeals
- She wants to know what is the policy when something is referred to the Board of Appeals?
- What happens with the case report and the findings that the Planning Commission issued?
- Isn't anything said at the Board of Appeals?
- Although this was a contentious case, there is a point to be made at the Board of Appeals by Planning staff so that the desires of the Planning Commission are transmitted.
David Sasson - US Navy
Re:  Various Items
- There is a very strong group of people who are interested in doing work in the City regarding changing the zoning in some areas of the City.
- This zoning would be to change some garages into retail shops.
- Many people from the media are investigating the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange building.  How did this become a place of nudity and exercise?  After the occurrence on the pacific coast of Thailand where many people have died...(dialog was unclear).
Sue Hestor
Re:  Board of Appeals
- Section 9, Provisions Governing the Board of Appeals states, "It is the duty of the department to forthwith scrutinize same and within three days notify the Board of Appeals of the people who appeared on the case..."
- This is a serious problem because the Commission has lost many cases.
- Until the joint hearing with the Board of Appeals, there are about five cases that will be turned down because the Commission's information is not transmitted to the Board of Appeals.

SPEAKER(S):
(-) Michael Ma - Discretionary Review Requestor
- The project does not meet Variance requirements with regards to extraordinary circumstances, hardship, etc.
- The project sponsor voluntary converted the garage to habitable space.
- The alley would be the passageway for the cars to come into the proposed garage.
- Each of the houses has a garage underneath.  That is the typical pattern of the homes in the area.
- If this project were approved, it would set a precedent for the rest of the houses in the neighborhood.
- He urged the Commission to not approve the Variance or the project.
(-) Sue Hestor
- She is very concerned about the burdenship to the Discretionary Review requestor since it should be on the Project Sponsor.
- All the houses in the area have similar fronts and similar backs.

- He lives in the neighborhood.
- He was not aware that the project sponsor was going to convert the garage to living space.
- People that appear with "unclean hands" before the Commission should not have their project approved.
- There are many people that have done construction work but have done it playing by the rules.
(+) Craig McGay - Project Sponsor
- He and his wife are the owners of the property.
- He initiated restoration of his property to maximize the use of indoor and outdoor space, and to provide a safe indoor and outdoor environment for his children.  He wants to continue a high point renovation of his house.
- He submitted plans for the previous construction and received the over-the-counter permit and completed the project.  He was shocked to receive a termination of this permit.
- He then tried to rectify it and was allowed to continue the work.
- He wanted to preserve the exterior of the home but maximize the interior as much as possible.
- There are houses in the neighborhood that have garage entrances in the alley.
- Various neighbors support his project.
(+) Dr. Wendy Robbins - Project Sponsor
- It is very important for her and her husband to complete the project to provide safety for her family.
- Currently the space where the garage is proposed is an "eye sore" as well as dangerous.

Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
Re:  Resolution - Item 23f:
Chris Durazo - SOMCAN
- She is concerned about a few issues:  She feels the $3.00 fee as a citywide impact fee for open spaces is just a PR piece; She feels the first resolve should be eliminated and the second one should be revised.
George Westlake - Archdiocese of San Francisco
- Many of the parishes have been working for many years for more affordable housing in the City.
- This resolution is the right step in that direction.
Ken Warner - Trinity Plaza Resident's Association
- This resolution does no good for people who cannot afford to buy a home in San Francisco.
April Veneracion - SOMCAN
- It is important to emphasize that Rincon Hill is a broader South of Market community.
- The impact fee should be directed specifically to the South of Market.
- On the last paragraph:  If a Mello-Roos is pursued, the cost savings to the developer should be based on the local impact fee.
- Commissioner Sue Lee requested sites for affordable housing.  She would like to see that information discussed today.
Barbara Long - Senior Housing Action Committee
- They adopted the platform for the South of Market.
- The South of Market Seniors have asked for jobs and housing for them - this could be added to the resolution.
- The community stabilization fund should be in the control of the South of Market area and not used throughout the city.
Calvin Welch - Council of Community Housing Coalition
- There is no date certain in the fourth paragraph of the resolution.
- The Commission should stipulate a specific date when the mitigations are to be decided upon.
Judith Baker - South of Market Child Care
- Her organization has adopted the community platform.
- She is glad that there will be first-source hiring, but housing also is very important.
- The mitigation measures should benefit the South of Market.
Sue Hestor
- There needs to be major improvements in the area.
- If the housing burden is shifting in the South of Market, then there should be improvements in the area as well.
- The Commission needs to communicate all this to the Board of Supervisors.
Reed Bement - Rincon Hill Residents Association
- The surrounding areas should benefit from the development impact fees.
- The affordable housing should be inclusionary.
- Funds should go to the Rincon Hill and immediate South of Market area.
Diego Sanchez - South of Market Community Coalition
- They hosted a meeting with planning staff.  It was mentioned at the meeting that the impact fees could go as high as $25.00.
- It would be great to get that extra "chunk!"
- It is important to go back to the drawing board and find out where the $25.00 is.
Re:  On the various proposed project actions listed below - items 22 and 23a-e:
Douglass Perry - Construction and Building Trades Council

Theodore Brown - Project Sponsor for 375 Fremont Street
- He thanked staff and the Commission for getting his project in the pipeline.
Brendan Donagan - Architect
- He has two projects in the area.
- Allowing 375 and 399 Fremont to go forward is the right idea.

Chris Durazo - SOMCAN
- She urged the Commission to look at the issue of cumulative impacts in the neighborhood.
- These towers will be high density.
- She urges the Commission not to pass the EIR.  It will come back again if the issues are not dealt with.

Glenn German

- The Commission is taking a disenfranchised community and hurting it further.

- She is very disappointed and encourages the Commission to revise the previous conversation or not pass the plan.

- There are tremendous City benefits to this plan and they should be implemented.
Mike Thereau
- He thanked staff for this plan and their efforts to include pipeline projects in the plan.
- He looks forward to moving on to the next steps.

Robert Meyers

- If the Commission votes yes to certify the EIR, people will take it to court.
Reed Bement - Rincon Hill Tenants Association

- It is important to see the needs of the South of Market.

- The EIR is not based on a real world.
Azalia Merrill - Carpenter's Union
- As a mother of three and a native San Franciscan she appreciates the comments for affordable housing.

F. REGULAR CALENDAR
PLEASE NOTE:  Regarding the following Rincon Hill Plan items - On April 21, 2005, following public testimony, the Commission closed the public hearing and passed a motion to continue these items for one week (to April 28, 2005) to engage in continued Commission deliberations with the stipulation that there would be no Commission action at that time.

RINCON HILL PLAN-Certification of Environmental Impact Report. The proposed project is a revised Rincon Hill Plan (an Area Plan of the San Francisco General Plan) and revised planning controls for the Rincon Hill area. The San Francisco Planning Department proposes to replace the Planning Code's existing Rincon Hill Special Use District (SUD), as set out in Planning Code Section 249.1, with a new Rincon Hill Downtown Residential Mixed Use District (DTR), which would increase height limits, revise the "R" bulk district, amend the Rincon Hill Area Plan, and make other General Plan and zoning changes intended to stimulate additional high-density, residential development in the Rincon Hill area. Improvements to the streetscape, transportation system and open space would result from implementation of the new Plan. Rincon Hill is in the northeast section of San Francisco, south of the Financial District and Transbay Terminal, and north of the South Beach neighborhood. The project area is bounded generally by Folsom Street, Steuart Street, The Embarcadero, Bryant Street, the Bay Bridge approach and the Transbay Terminal ramps and encompasses about 12 city blocks.
NOTE:The public hearing on the Draft EIR is closed. The public comment period for the Draft EIR ended on December 10, 2004.  The Planning Commission does not conduct public review of Final EIRs.  Public comments on the certification may be presented to the Planning Commission during the Public Comment portion of the Commission calendar.

With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public comment, the commission is limited to:
(1)  responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or
(2)  requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or
(3)  directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.  (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))
