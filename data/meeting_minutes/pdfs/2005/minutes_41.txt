ACTION:Approved as amended:
.
1.Eliminate the requirement relating to “community clubhouse[s], neighborhood center[s], or other community cultural center[s].”Defining and listing such facilities with fairness, accuracy, and/or consistency is not possible. Moreover, the merit of this requirement is debatable in light of the broad spectrum of uses and types of community facilities.
2.Add a requirement to prohibit MCD’s within 500 feet (or 1,000 feet if smoking is offered on-site) of children’s playgrounds operated by the Recreation and Parks Department.MCD’s have potential negative externalities of a type that should not be allowed to impact children’s play areas. To implement this requirement, the Recreation and Park Department should provide the Planning Department with a list of such facilities at regular intervals not less than once each calendar year.
3.Allow operation only between 8am and 10pm, excepting one MCD per district which should be allowed to remain open at all hours.Operation of multiple dispensaries beyond these base hours could create conflict with nearby land uses and prevailing neighborhood character. Moreover, these hours are typical of many conventional pharmacies. An MCD is intended to serve a public health need; late-night operation has the undesirable effect of rendering a facility more comparable to a nighttime-entertainment establishment than a medical outlet. Reasonable patient access to medical cannabis has been anticipated by the drafters of Proposition 215 in the form of designated caregivers. Should a patient not be able to procure his or her medicine within the proscribed hours of operation, a caregiver has the ability to obtain his or her patient’s medicine on his or her behalf. Nonetheless, the allowance for a single facility to remain open at all hours account for unforeseen and/or emergency situations under which medical product is required without any delay.
4.Allow applications to be received only during a one-time-only filing period.DPH should be allowed to receive MCD permit applications only during a 180-day filing window, which would commence upon the effective date of the legislation. Thereafter, DPH would be required to submit a yearly report to the Board of Supervisors describing the overall adequacy of the City’s medical cannabis services. Should the Board so choose, it would then have the option of pursuing legislative measures to reopen the application period. This modification is based on the premise set forth in Supervisor Elsbernd’s similar legislation (introduced under Board File Number 051455).
5.Encourage appropriate Planning Staff levels.Advise the Board to explore authorizing the Department to retain a temporary staff-person trained in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) who can aid the Department in assembling a proximity based mapping system so that MCD applications can be quickly and efficiently processed in the great numbers expected.
