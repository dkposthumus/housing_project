Planning Code Section 260311Amendments-Consideration of an Ordinance amending San Francisco Planning Code by amending section 260 to increase the height exemption for elevator penthouses from 10 to 16 feet, to allow the Zoning Administrator to grant further exemptions for buildings with height limits of more than 65 feet where such an exemption is required to meet state or federal laws or regulations; and making findings of consistency with the priority policies of Planning Code Section 101.1 and the General Plan.
Preliminary Recommendation:Approval with Modifications
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Theodore Brown – Architect
- Under the present code, it is very difficult to do elevators because of the height limit.
- This will enable us to provide access go through the entire building and allow the handicapped to access elevators.
(-) Sue Hestor
- The Commission needs to take some time and ask questions from DBI.
- They will certainly be giving their perspectives.
- This will encourage elevators and encourage roof top open spaces.
- There should be a total ban on using this extra height if a project will be right up next to people’s properties.
- The Commission does not have enough information to decide on this legislation.
(+) Charles Breninger
- San Francisco has tremendous scenery and the best place to see this at the top of a roof.
- Roofs are very valuable and people should be allowed to go to the roof.
- This legislation allows people and those with handicaps to have access to the roof.
(+) Joe Cassidy
- He is in favor of this legislation and how it will affect new buildings.
- People should have full access to roofs.
- Without having that four foot area, a developer cannot comply under CAL OSHA rules.
(+) Gary Gee
- This legislation is very significant for various reasons, including elderly housing that will be constructed in the future.
- This legislation will be very beneficial in the RC-3 and RC-4 zoning districts.
- Sixteen feet is not the entire roof.It is only a small portion.
(+) Alice Barkley
- She supports this legislation and hopes the Commission will pass it.
- CAL OSHA implemented this requirement because of a previous accident.
- It is really essential that this legislation be adopted so that when there is a need to go to the roof an elevator will be available.
ACTION:Hearing Held.Public hearing remains open for any new information.Item continued to June 23, 2005.
