5800 Third Street Residential and Commercial Mixed-Use Project- Appeals of Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration- The proposed project would consist of construction of a residential and commercial mixed-use development after demolition of a defunct bottling plant facility at 5800 Third Street (Assessor’s Block 5431A, Lot 001), at the southwest corner of Third Street and Carroll Avenue in the Bayview neighborhood.The project would include 355 multi-family residential units in four buildings, 13,000 gross square feet (gsf) of ground floor retail space in two of the buildings that would be along Third Street, and 379 off-streetparking spaces in the four buildings. The four buildings would total 641,920 gsf in size, ranging in height from 50 to 60 feet tall (four to five stories) and would be built around a central plaza and a private driveway with two visitor loading spaces, with access from Carroll Avenue.Sixteen surface parking spaces for the retail uses would be provided on the south side of the project site, with access provided from a right-turn-only driveway on Third Street at the southern boundary of the site.Twenty surface parking spaces for visitors would be provided along the central private driveway.Currently, the 5.75-acre site is occupied by a three-story, 103,000-gsf closed Coca-Cola bottling plant constructed in 1966, which would be demolished. Current use of the site is temporary parking of moving company trucks and charter buses.The site is within an M-1 (Light Industrial) District, the Third Street Special Use District (SUD), a 65-J Height and Bulk District, and the proposed Bayview Hunters Point Redevelopment Projects and Zoning Health Center Activity Node.The project would require Conditional Use Authorization for a Planned Unit Development and for residential uses in an M-1 District by the Planning Commission, which is a public hearing process.

Dean Macris – Director of Planning responded:
Commissioner Antonini:
-In terms of comments by Commissioner Olague, I agree it would be interesting to see what part--not in terms of the affordable /inclusion component but at the market rate housing--what part of the process is responsible for the cost.
Susan Cleveland-Knowles – Deputy City Attorney’s Office responded:
Commissioner Olague:
-In a lot of the issue brought here, we hear frequently that the more housing that’s built will bring the cost of housing down in the City.Are there any studies available that give credit to that theory?

Market & Octavia Neighborhood Plan-Public Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Report:The project area is located in the central city neighborhoods along Market Street from about 9thStreet to the east to Noe Street to the west, north along the former Central Freeway alignment at Turk Street, and south along Howard and Sixteenth Streets.The project site encompasses about 85 city blocks.The proposed neighborhood plan would reclassify the existing zoning from Residential (R), Neighborhood Commercial Districts (NCD’s), Heavy Commercial (C-M), and Downtown General Commercial (C-3-G) Districts to Residential Transit Oriented (RTO), Neighborhood Commercial Transit (NCT), and Downtown Residential (DTR) Districts. It would also increase height limits in certain areas and reduce the existing height limits in other areas.The proposed zoning and height reclassifications would increase the potential for residential development in the area.
Note: Written comments will be received at the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m. on August 9th, 2005.

491 BAYSHORE BOULEVARD - HOME DEPOT-Certification of a Final Environmental Impact Report- Subsequent to the publication of the Draft EIR the projectsponsor identified a new preferred project. The revised project re-orients the location of the parking garage and the store itself, so that the parking garage is located on the southern end of the project site and the store is located on the northern end of the project site, but the effects would be similar to those analyzed for the original project in the Draft EIR.The home improvement center would beapproximately 153,089 square feet, the same size as the original project.The store would include approximately 95,600 square feet of retail on the main floor, approximately 37,700 square feet of retail on the second floor, approximately 9,900 square feet of enclosed greenhouse space, and approximately 9,900 square feet of open garden center space. The separate parking garage would consist of two levels plus rooftop parking, totaling approximately 247,800 square feet and would include 555 parking spaces.
The proposed project consists of demolition of two vacant buildings, totaling 107,346 square feet on this 5.73-acre site. The proposed buildings would be approximately 40 feet in height. Vehicular access to the parking garage would be from Bayshore Boulevard with secondary access on Loomis Street. The project is located within the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood. The proposed project would not require a conditional use authorization, however a staff-initiated discretionary review is before the Planning Commission. The site is within the adopted Industrial Protection Zone (IPZ) Special Use District and is located in a M-1 (Light Industrial) zoning district and within a 65-J height and bulk district.
Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the Final Environmental Impact Report.
