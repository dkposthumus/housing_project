7.  Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner W. Lee:
Re:  Zoning an Entertainment District
- Has San Francisco ever considered an entertainment zoning district?
- He would like staff to investigate where entertainment in the City can be located.
Commissioner Antonini:
Re: Notice Processing
- There has been a lot of discussion about problems in the processing of notices.
- He believes that part of the conflict  with the delays has been seen between the public's ability to comment freely and be heard in full, and the ability to move projects forward.  The public should be able to comment for as long as necessary.
- He believes that noticing should be increased as much as possible to achieve the broadest outreach to the public within their neighborhoods.  This should include commercial projects.
Commissioner S. Lee:
Re:  Status of Various Projects
- As the Commission begins to review neighborhood plans and adopt the plans, questions from the public comes up regarding the status of these jobs.
- She asked the City Attorney for a written opinion on the legal entitlements of the projects the Commission approves.
8. Discussion of the responsibilities assigned to the Zoning Administrator by City Charter and Planning Code.
Judy Boyagian, Deputy City Attorney, commented:
The Zoning Administrator is a Charter Official. This position is specifically mentioned in section 4.105 of the Charter.  The only power that he has that is expressed in the Charter itself is the authority to determine Variances. Prior to the Charter amendment in 1996, there were other Zoning Administrator powers in the Charter (for example:  enforcement of the code) but they were removed in the 1996 revision.  Everything except for the Variance power is in the Planning Code.  Most of the duties are set out in Section 307.
Many people are aware that the Zoning Administrator will also issue written interpretations of the Planning Code.  These are now on the Planning Department's web site. He has the power to enforce the code through calling on other city officials like the City Attorney, District Attorney and Chief of Police.
The Zoning Administrator's primary duty is to interpret and enforce the Planning Code.  One of the issues that has been contentious recently is when the Planning Commission has approved a project and imposed conditions on it, what is the authority of the Zoning Administrator to modify those decisions when the Commission's decision id appealed to the Board of Appeals or Board of Supervisors and they impose conditions?  Basically he has no power to modify or change the decision.  What he does have the authority to do is to interpret that decision.  Section 174, specifically states that conditions that are prescribed on projects by the Planning Commission, Board of Appeals or Board of Supervisors actually become provisions of the Planning Code.  The specific provisions of the Planning Code can be enforced and interpreted by the Zoning Administrator, in the same way as enacted provisions of the Planning Code.
If there is a question about whether a project modification is consistent with the decision approval action, the Zoning Administrator is the only actual official that has the authority to make the decision, interpret the action.  The clearer the action is of course, the easier his job is.  If it is a little ambiguous, he has a harder job.  Any decision he makes in that regard is appealable to the Board of Appeals.
SPEAKER(S):
Bernard Choden
- Things have gotten worse in the past eight years.
- The remedy is to realize the needs of the City.
- Reform is needed to modernize the Planning process.
Sue Hestor
- The Zoning Administrator position has a lot of power.
- It is important that the Zoning Administrator find out what the problems are but not try to solve them himself.
John Schlesinger
- He commended the Commission for their comments on this matter.  You (the Commission) are concentrating on the position and not on the individual.
- There is a necessity that the position be an autonomous position.
- The public may not agree with the decision, and may fight the decision, but the important thing is that the Zoning Administrator does what is stated in the Planning Code.
- This is a very important issue for neighborhood groups.
Gerry Crowley - Former President of the Telegraph Hill Dwellers' Association.
- She is concerned about a particular case where she believes that the Zoning Administer actually changed the law with a determination.
- The case is a restaurant known as Basta Pasta at 1234 to 1268 Grant Avenue.  The space operated as a pasta restaurant from 1986 to 2000.  Under plans that were approved under interim controls, the plans were approved one week prior to the North Beach Commercial District legislation being passed.  There were extensive negotiations between the neighborhood organization and the project sponsor.  Just to the exterior, for example, there were violations of the original CU.  In 2000, the restaurant closed and four years later in 2004 the building was sold. The new buyers asked the Zoning Administrator for the abandonment provisions of the code. The Zoning Administrator found that the abandonment did not apply because the original owner had tried to sell the property as a restaurant and didn't intend to abandon it.  Now that four years have gone by, the Zoning Administrator says that the code, that the law does not apply.
- She beleives that the Zonining Administrator has a very dangerous use of power.
Kepa Askenasy
- She displayed a flowchart of the development process.
- She asked that a series of hearings be scheduled in order to understand how the Department is structured.
- How does the community perceive corruption?
Arthur Chang - Vice Chair, Park and Recreation Advisory Committee
- Does the Zoning Administrator have the power to administer a law?
- What authority does the Zoning Administrator have to encounter mandated law?
Pat Buscovich
- He thanked the Commission for explaining why this item was on the agenda.
- This is one of the most important things that the Commission will be discussing.
- He knows that the current Zoning Administrators is one of the most ethical people that he knows.
- The Board of Appeals is another autonomous body.
- The description that the City Attorney mentioned is very well said.
Teresa Garcia
- As more projects are approved, it is important to see the check and balances.
- There have been a lot of businesses that have had to move away because of decisions of the Zoning Administrator.
Fernando Martin - Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition
- Over the last ten years there have been a lot of changes in various neighborhoods.
- There are decisions that the Zoning Administrator has made that are kind of "fuzzy."
- The Zoning Administrator has created policy for certain areas when in fact that was not the intention of the Commission.
- When the interpretations are added up, they can become actual policy.
Bob Passmore
- He was Zoning Administrator for 25 years.
- This subject is a very difficult one.
- Previously, the Planning Code was less complex than it is now so there were fewer things to interpret.
- There are a lot of "grey" areas in the Planning Code.
- Uses over time have been changed and added to the code.
Eileen Gold
- She has been here before in September of 2004 regarding a project on 18thStreet.
- The ZA referenced a motion by the Board of Supervisors.  This project has been going on since the 90s.  In 2001, the Commission made certain conditions about the project that was appealed to the Board of Supervisors.  They added more conditions to the project.
- Instead of the correct motion, the ZA used the previous motion before the Board of Supervisor's conditions.
- They have gone through the Board of Appeals but have had no luck.
Charles Marsteller
- The Zoning Administrator, as with the Commission, can be removed only if there is a just cause.
- As a civil servant, the Zoning Administrator is subject to an annual review.
- There should be some clarification of the structure of his position.
- The Commission has raised very interesting questions today.
John Bardis
- Neither the Commission nor the Zoning Administrator has the ability to change the law.
- The ZA does interpretations according to the law.
- There should be questions when the Commission has issued an action and it is not carried out.
- The question is if the Commission is doing their job and carrying out the will of the public?
C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT
9. Director's Announcement
Dean Macris reported:
Land Use Committee
Re:  Review of Status of Backlog
- He appeared before the Land Use Committee.  They understand the Planning Department's issues which are the reasons for our delays.
- There will be a fee analysis to make them consistent; the tracking system will be integrated; and finally, an analysis of procedures and processes will be done.
- Also, our short-term solution will be to fill the vacancies.
Alicia John-Baptiste reported
- The Department has a number of vacant positions which totals about 16% of the total funded positions.
- There is a hiring program in place for each of the five major areas in the Department.
- Three positions in the environmental analysis unit, seven in neighborhood planning, seven in city-wide, three in the Director's office and two in administration.
- There have been two offers to date, both of which have been accepted.  Over the next couple of weeks, there will be a number of interviews for Planner II and Planner III positions.
- At the same time, there is recruitment going on for a number of other positions, those include the higher level planner positions--the Planner IV positions, as well as some classifications that fall outside of the planning series, including a community outreach coordinator.
- Interviews for these positions will probably start in early to mid May with staff coming on board a month after that process begins.
- Search for all these position includes internal and external applicants as well as promotions.
- With all the new staff, there is hope that soon the backfill will become less and less.
Director Macris reported:
- The two administrative positions mentioned are for planners for the transportation section of the department.
10. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
BOS:  The Zoning Administrator reported:
624 Divisadero
- This was an appeal of an 18-unit condominium at a location where a church would be demolished.  There was very little discussion at the Planning Commission.
- A neighborhood group indicated that this had been a theatre and felt that it was important to preserve.  An environmental analysis of the project was done but did not result in the original negative declaration being withdrawn.
- Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi lead a negotiation that resulted in the project being revised so that rather than the theater being demolished which fronts on Divisadero, the building fronting on Hayes would be built.  The back of the theatre would be demolished but the public spaces of the theatre would be retained.
- The appellant was not satisfied with this and still had concerns.
- The project was continued.  Perhaps a new CU will be issued and brought back to the Commission.
Re:  One Polk Street
- There were changes to the design of this project.
- There were questions of whether these changes were in conformity.  After some analysis there was a decision that it was.  He will be issuing a letter to this effect.
BOA:  The Zoning Administrator reported:
Re:  141 Willard North
- This was a demolition that the Commission disapproved.
- The Board of Appeals overruled the Planning Commission's disapproval and approved the demolition by a +5-0 vote.
Re:  555 Buena Vista West
- This was not before the Commission but he thought it would be important to report.
- This 1930s art deco apartment building had steel windows that were deteriorating.
- The project sponsor wanted to replace the windows with vinyl windows.  Staff has argued that it is important to maintain the same type of window systems.  Staff has not been very successful on this.
- The Board upheld the Department's position of installing vinyl windows with an aluminum base.
Re:  3775 21stStreet
- There was some discussion on this Variance.  He determined that the Discretionary Review period had expired.  Only the Variance only was heard.

- They have done extensive outreach in the area and everyone has to be heard.
- This plan has nine to ten years in the works.  No one is rushing.
- The community is representative of the PAC and vice-versa.
(+) C.J. Higley - Reuben and Junius
- They do think that the time has come to initiate this plan.
- After ten years, the time has come.
(-) David Wilbur
- He is a recent PAC member.
- He is one of two people that voted against this plan.
- This was not a very open process.  Most of the meetings were held at the Flood building in back rooms.
- Most of the powerful land use attorneys have developed this plan.
- It is important that there is review of all the community impacts.
(-) Carolyn Blair - SF Tree Council and the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition
- The coalition is concerned.  This will generate increased automobile traffic and be hazardous for bicycle riders.
- Market Street is the busiest bicycle corridor.
- There are existing heavily used bicycle lanes on 7thand 9thstreets.
- The Transportation Authority Market Street study calls for decreasing car traffic and increasing pedestrian and bicycle riders' safety.
- They oppose residential parking in areas that are rich in public transportation.
- Cars can live underground but not people.
- This plan should be amended.
(-) Jeremy Nelson - Transportation for a Livable City
- There are outstanding concerns with this plan.
- The mid-market area has one of the lowest ownership of cars in the City.
- Despite having low ownership of cars, the area has high transit of cars.
- There are high statistics of people getting killed by cars.
- They oppose one to one parking, allowing three stories of aboveground parking, etc.
- This plan is not ready for "prime time."
