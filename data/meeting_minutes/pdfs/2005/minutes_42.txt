B.COMMISSIONERS’ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
4.Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Antonini:I have a couple of questions.One is on one of the items that is being continued—The Great Highway.I have been informed that this general review exemption occurred in June of 2004, which means we are now approximately 18 months from the time of the exemption.So one would believe that if someone had a problem with it they would have filed an appeal before now.I think we have a problem--one that has to be dealt with at the State level.I don’t know if the city can do anything to limit the appeal period on these type of things—both negative declarations and categorical exemptions of environmental review—because it clearly does not seem to be used properly.It may only be a tactic to delay.I’m not saying that is the case here, but it seems very odd that this appeal would be done at such a late time.I think this has happened many, many times.This is something I would like to see if there is any jurisdiction we have or if it has to be done on a State level.
Kate Stacey, Deputy City Attorney responded:Commissioner Antonini is correct in that the state law, CEQA, requires appeals of categorical exemptions and other determinations as well as negative declarations to the elected legislative body.In our case this body is the Board of Supervisors.The City has not adopted any procedures or time limits within which those appeals have to take place and how they have to take place.So our office has advised that as long as threw is still an outstanding permit for the city to review and consider approval of, that those appeals are timely because the CEQA determination is linked to the approval itself.As long as the city still has some discretionary approval, we would like the clerk of the Board to consider the appeal of those timely.
Commissioner Antonini:To change that, you’re saying that it does have to be at a State level?
Kate Stacey, Deputy City Attorney responded:Commissioner Antonini, the Board has to adopt procedures for the appeal of exemptions and negative declarations.It has not done so.…The Clerk of the Board has adopted some procedural rules for how those appeals occur.But there are no time limits within which an appeal must occur.
Commissioner Antonini:So what body of the city would have power to do that sort of thing?
Kate Stacey, Deputy City Attorney:The Board of Supervisors enacts amendments to the Administrative Code—to Chapter 31.
Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator also responded:Commissioners, the department has urged the Board of Supervisors to take this up.The department has indicated, or I have indicated myself, that I was going to introduce or have the department introduce an ordinance that would do that.I got a distinctly negative reaction.It does not seem like this Board is pursuing this issue.
Commissioner Antonini:Thank you.My other comment deals with…
It has been called to my attention by a couple of people that they read in theWest Portal Monthlya paraphrase of some remarks I made.It was not a direct quote.When you paraphrase, oftentimes, you don’t get the meaning of what was really said.I know the author.She does a wonderful job and I appreciate her articles very much.But I did not say that West Portal was no longer a viable retail corridor as was mentioned there.It’s a very viable retail corridor.It’s one of the most viable in the city.
There was a reference also made to Stonestown.I think that they do have somewhat of a unique situation because certain retail outlets that might occur in other streets, such as Fillmore, Chestnut, even Haight, such as the Gap or Pottery Barn or others, would not locate there because they are right close to Stonestown.In that regard, you’re a little more limited in the type of retail that will come in.I think that was the nature of my comments.
I also mentioned some other streets are evolving.You’ve seen 24thStreet had a ban on new restaurants for many years and they’ve now decided that no longer applies.I don’t know what the people in West Portal feel about financial institutions.I certainly was supportive of their objections in the ‘70s and ‘80s on the basis that there were too many of those institutions that not only proliferates but also proliferates architecturally.I don’t think the best land use (as we look at it today) could be on single floor large parking lots.Historically, it’s been two or three floors.In that regard—just on an architectural basis—it’s something I hope they look at in the future regardless of what position is taken on the overall issue of the financial institutions themselves.
Finally, in regard to that, I did mention that Broderick Place over on Fell Street which we had approved was sort of a real model of what could possibly be done in a lot of these areas where you’re taking a bank in a parking lot and turning it into a market, a smaller bank, housing, parking and retail.I’m anxious to see that project finished because it may serve as a model for some of the residential streets in the future.
Commissioner Olague:Peter Cohen was mentioning the Backstreet Advisory Board he was on.I’d like to understand where they are.What the deliberations and what some of there findings might be and how it relates to what we are deliberating on in the Eastern Neighborhoods.I don’t know where the best place for that would be.

SPEAKERS:None
ACTION:Approved
AYES:Alexander, Antonini, Hughes, W. Lee, and Olague
ABSENT:Bradford-Bell and S. Lee
6.Director’s Announcements
Dean Macris, Director of Planning:Next week is a short calendar and we’ll be bringing a number of items for updates.The first is Green Buildings.We’ve also been talking about Dwelling Unit mergers, First Source Advisory and City Build.
Last week you approved 410 Jessie Street.Ms. Hester questioned whether the transit impact development fee was applicable and if paid.She believed the sponsor—I believe the word she used was—had cheated the city out of owed fees.I think you’ve received emails from Mr. Yarnee documenting the Muni’ exemption of this in a letter dated I think 1/7/05.Met with Mr. Banks today.The materials [he] presented at our meeting allowed me to confirm the 1999 launch project of this site as not subject to the Transit Impact Development Fee.Although the proposed and approved new building configuration includes office use, the square footages at the previous use provides a credit larger than the office portion.I think there is pretty extensive information here demonstrating compliance with the Transit Impact Development Fee.
7.Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
Commissioner Olague:As far as the Visitacion Valley fees are concerned, was there any discussion regarding Bayview?
Dan Sider:There was some discussion at the Committee level.It is my understanding that there was not a level of discussion at the full Board on Tuesday.
