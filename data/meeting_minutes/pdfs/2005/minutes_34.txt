3.  Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner S. Lee:
Re:  Managing Calendar
- She would like a better understanding of how the calendars for the Planning Commission hearings could be better balanced.
Commissioner Antonini:
Re:  Managing Calendar
- He agrees with Commissioner Sue Lee.
Zoning Administrator responded:
- In most cases, projects need to be noticed 30 days in advance before they are advertised on the calendars.
- Often, when a hearing date is closed because there are too many cases, some cases drop off for a variety of reasons, which could result in a very short calendar.
Commission Secretary responded:
- Also, when Commissioners continue items to other dates that could have already been closed because it was too full, often adds to the load of that hearing.
- It would always help if Commissioners could be prepared with their concerns and questions and ready to take an action [on the date the item is scheduled for hearing].
- Once she closes a hearing and cases drop off, because of noticing requirements, it is usually too late to add other cases-which could result in some light calendars like today.
Commissioner S. Lee:
Re:  Managing Calendar
- Can some cases that don't require a 30-day notice be placed on shorter calendars?
Deputy City Attorney Kate Stacey responded:
- There is no advanced notice beyond the agenda that is required.
Zoning Administrator responded:
- The cases that don't require a notice can be placed on the calendar, but there might be certain parties that would appreciate a longer announcement period.
Commissioner Olague:
Re:  Managing Calendar
- Is the backlog a result of the shorter calendars?
Zoning Administrator responded:
- On the most part the problem of backlog is the lack of staff.
- Over the past few months, there have been light calendars.
Commissioner W. Lee:
Re:  Census
- Some time ago he asked for a briefing on the census.
- He requested that the Commission receive data regarding the language that is spoken in San Francisco.  This ties into the City's request to access of records.
Zoning Administrator responded:
- He recalls receiving an email about this and will be responding to this request.
Commission Secretary:
- She reminded Commissioners that the Statement of Economic Interest is due April 1 and she will need their signed statements before this date.
- She thanked the commissioners who attended the training.  The Commissioners that could not attend will receive a training video.
C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT
4. Director's Announcements
Re:  Special Hearing on March 31, 2005
- Staff is preparing for a special hearing on this date to talk about the housing in downtown and who is occupying this.
- There is a list of very interesting speakers who will be giving presentations.
5. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
BOS -
- Michael Garcia was recommended to fill Commissioner Harrignton's seat at the Board of Appeals.
- He received a positive recommendation to the Board of Supervisors from the Rules Committee.
BOA -
Re:  1344 Bush Street - Regency Theatre
- He [the Zoning Administrator] had issued a determination a while back stating that an activity that wanted to move in seemed similar to an office.  This decision was overruled.  It was actually an art's activity.
- Ms. Sue Hestor requested that the Zoning Administrator request a rehearing and I have done so.
- There is no change in the project, just documenting of the office space that is in the building.
- The Board will take up this request on March 30, 2005.
Commissioner Olague:
Re:  Health Impact Assessment
- She noticed in the advanced calendar this is to be heard on March 31, 2005.
Zoning Administrator responded:
- On the 31, 2005, the housing information will be first then at a time certain will be the Health Assessment.
Commissioner Olague:
- When the Commission hears reports about the Board of Supervisors, does the report include the Land Use Committee?
Zoning Administrator responded:
- Yes.  The Land Use Committee did not meet this week.
- Next week, the Committee will discuss the inclusionary housing program along with the Mayor's Office of Housing.
Commissioner Antonini:
Re: March 31, 2005 Hearing
- It would be good to see exit interviews [from companies] who might have wanted to stay in San Francisco but couldn't.
Zoning Administrator responded:
- He has not been able to make contact with the Board of Appeal's President.
- He wanted time for the new member to be seated and address their backlog.
- He will then suggest a joint hearing.  This might not take place for a month or more.
D. GENERALPUBLIC COMMENT - 15 MINUTES
At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting.

Jeremy Paul
Re:  496 Fair Oaks Street
- His wife is in the hospital and he can't stay for the call of this item.
- A couple purchased this house.
- The unit downstairs was legalized for a very specific purpose.
- He is surprised that this did not show on the record and that it continued beyond the special purpose.
