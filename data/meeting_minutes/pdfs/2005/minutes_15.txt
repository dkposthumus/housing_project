ACTION:Approved as modified:
Section 6.Voting.
a.Procedural Matters.Pursuant to Charter Section 4.104, with respect to matters of procedure the Commission may act by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members present, so long as the members present constitute a quorum.
b.Except as provided in “a” above, every Official Act taken by the Commission, including, but not limited to, those based on its jurisdiction derived from the Planning Code, Chapter 31 of the Administrative Code, the Subdivision Code and Discretionary Review Powers of the Commission, may be by “Motion” or Resolution adopted by a majority vote of all members of the Commission (four (4) votes).All members present shall vote for or against each question brought to a vote unless a member is excused from voting by a conflict of interest or a motion adopted by a majority of the members present.
A motion that receives less than four votes is a failed motion resulting in disapproval of the action requested to be taken by the Commission unless a substitute motion for a continuance or other action is adopted.(For example:a request for Conditional Use requires four votes to approve; failure to receive the four votes results in denial of the conditional use.A request for Discretionary Review requires four votes to take discretionary review and modify the project; failure to receive the four votes results in approval of the proposed project without modification.)
A motion of intent occurs when the Commission passes a motion by a majority of all members of the Commission that is contrary to the preliminary recommendation of the Planning Department staff and does not have findings that support the intended action.Any Commissioner absent from participation in the action of intent must be provided all relevant case material and hearing tapes for review prior to a scheduled hearing for consideration of the final motion.
c.Once the Commission holds the public hearing on a permit application, receives all public testimony and declares that it is ready to consider approval or disapproval of the application, the applicant shall not be permitted to withdraw the application, except with the consent of the Commission.In the event that the Commission passes any motion of intent to approve or disapprove a permit application before them, the applicant shall not be permitted to withdraw the application prior to the Commission’s completion of their action with passage of a written “Motion” with findings or a resolution.
d.Once the Commission holds a public hearing on a matter before them, enters into deliberation and a motion for action is made and receives a second prior to the end of discussion, a request for “call the question” by any member other than the President or Chair would be addressed as follows:The request for “call the question” is considered a motion to halt discussion and must have a second to proceed.If the motion does not receive a second, the motion dies and discussion resumes on the matter on the floor prior to the motion to “call the question.”If the motion receives a second then a vote must be taken immediately and passed by a majority of those present.
Section 7.Jurisdiction.Pursuant to Charter Section 4.105, the Commission has the jurisdiction to approve prior to issuance “[all] permits and licenses dependent on, or affected by, the Planning Code administered by the Planning Department.”Acting under this section, the Commission may at its discretion by a majority vote of the Commission (four votes), request staff to bring before it for review any such permit or license that has not yet been issued even if the application has been approved by the Commission or Department staff and forwarded to the Central Permit Bureau.The Commission loses jurisdiction upon either the City’s issuance of the permit or license, or a valid appeal has been filed to an appellant body.
