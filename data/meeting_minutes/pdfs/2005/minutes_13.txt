3.1999.0414E(C. ROOS: (415) 558-5981)
325 FREMONT STREET- Residential development with parking - Assessor’s Block3747, Lots 012, 013, and 014 -Substitution of Mitigation Measure and Addendum to a Final Negative Declaration.Re-evaluation of the revised project which is detailed in the following agenda items for the project (Case Nos. 2004.0636C and 2004.0636V), has led to an Addendum (December 20, 2004) to the prior Negative Declaration (CaseNo.1999.0414E, Final Negative Declaration, February 29, 2000). The revisions to the project would increase the number of units from 59 to 70, an increase of 11 units; increase the number of parking spaces from 57 to 70, with use of mechanical lifts; eliminate a proposed roof deck and solarium and reduce the floors of the building by one (from 22 stories to 21 stories); and widen and landscape a portion of the Fremont Street sidewalk as provision of open space.The revised project would maintain the same height and mass of the building analyzed in the final Negative Declaration. The Addendum found that the conclusions of the prior Negative Declaration, with an updated mitigation measure, remain current and valid.In the resource area of archaeology, a modified, more intensive archeological resources mitigation measure, based on more recent information regarding potential archeological resources in the project vicinity is being required.The other mitigation measures remain unchanged and a revised Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan, including the new mitigation measure, has been prepared for project adoption. The CEQA Guidelines, Section 15074.1, states that a public hearing be held and findings made when one mitigation measure is deleted from a Negative Declaration for a project and another is substituted and a determination be made that the new mitigation measure is, “[Equivalent or more effective” in avoiding or reducing the potential adverse effect of the project.This finding will be made during Commission consideration of the project for approval.
Preliminary Recommendation: Hold public hearing on substitution of mitigation measure.

C.DIRECTOR’S REPORT
7.Director’s Announcements
Interim Director Macris Reported:
- The committee met yesterday.Planning staff made some suggestions regarding the Special Use District.
- The decision made yesterday was to set some meetings in order to make a decision to vote on the Special Use District area.The next meeting will be in February 2005.The plan is to have the new rules set up in June 2005.
- He feels very good about the meeting last night and has all the optimism that the committee will vote in February.
- On January 20, there will be an informational item on this so that when it comes to the Commission in March, there will be better understanding.
Zoning Administrator Badiner Reported:
Re:724-730 Van Ness Avenue
- This case was before the Commission in either 2000 or 2001.
- It was proposed as 141 residential units.
- He received a few letters on request for determination.
- He issued a letter of determination.
- The most important question here is whether this project is a for sale project or a rental project?
- The Conditions of Approval stated that the units shall be rented.
- The affordable units must be rented.They could be sold to an individual but they must be rented.
Commissioner W. Lee:
- He had previously asked the Zoning Administrator to speak to the City Attorney to find out if the City is being misguided.
Zoning Administrator responded:
- If he consults with the City Attorney, and the Board of Appeals disagrees, the City Attorney needs to be able to defend the Board of Appeals final determination.
- He did consult with the City Attorney but he is not going to state whether he agrees or disagrees with the comments.
Commissioner W. Lee:
- He is just concerned about transparency with the City.
- He does not understand why the Zoning Administrator cannot just say that he has received consultation from the City Attorney and to state where they stand.
City Attorney Boyajian responded:
- It is true that different parts of the City have their own City Attorney but most generally, the attorneys all speak with one voice.
- They don’t want to be in a position where they are conflicting with each other.
Zoning Administrator responded:
- He is ready to say right now that he has spoken with the City Attorney and this is their position.
Commissioner Antonini:
- It is his understanding that with the projects the Commission approves; the project sponsor has the flexibility to go whichever way they want.
Commissioner Hughes:
- The unusual thing about this project is the hope that the Commission will not rehear it.
Zoning Administrator:
- He agreed with he project sponsor that reducing the number of units was not in general conformity.
- The project was then re-modified and designed closer to the original.
Commissioner Hughes:
- At some point there was a request to rehear this project.
Zoning Administrator:
- The Board of Appeals may decide that it is not within the bounds of the original approval and request that another Conditional Use is applied for.

300 SPEAR STREET-the northern half of the block bounded by Folsom Street to the north, Spear Street to the east, Harrison Street to the south, and Main Street to the west, Lot 1 in Assessor’s Block 3745 - Report on refinements to the project design for a proposed large scale mixed-use project (predominately residential) that would consist of two towers and two podium buildings, approved under Planning Commission Motion No. 16648.Condition 15 of the Motion requires an informational presentation before the Commission prior to Building Permit approval.
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Carl Shannon – Tishman Spier Properties
- He will give a brief introduction of the project.
- Arquitectonika has been working extensively with the department related to streetscape.
- They have increased the number of bedrooms in each unit.
- The structural engineer worked through a new performance based peer review.
- They removed the need to have a moment frame and removed the outer beams.
- They also have full support from Supervisor Daly.
(+) Clark Mannus – Project Architect -
- He gave an overview of the architectural aspects of the project.
(-) Reed Deement – Rincon Hill Residents Association
- The project is very different from he project that was described in the EIR and the project that the Commission approved.
- There is nothing to indicate that there have been new shadow or design studies as a result of the changes to the design.
(+) Andrew Brooks – Bay Crest and Rincon Hill Residents Association
- They are encouraged with the concept of family housing units.This is over and above the affordable component that is required by the Commission.
- The project sponsor has told him that they are willing to work on creating family units in these units.
(-) Sue Hestor
- If this project were planned in any other neighborhood there would be many more studies done.Since this project is in the Rincon Hill, it appears that this presentation is mostly run by the project sponsor.
- The towers are very, very large.
- This project needs to be looked at more closely.
- She does not see a lot of information here.
- This is a really dramatic change.It is not the worse architectural solution but the Commission needs to understand it completely.
(-) Ed Bidard – Vice President of the Hayes Valley Association
- The Board decided on reducing the parking on this project.
- When this project is built there will be a lot of traffic congestion.
- Adding more cars to the neighborhood will cause problems.
- He hopes that the parking situation can be revisited.
ACTION:Informational only.No Action Required by the Commission.
D.GENERALPUBLIC COMMENT – 15 MINUTES
Marilyn Amini
Re:724-730 Van Ness Avenue
- There is due process.This project was talked about during Director’s Report.
- The public deserves the right to speak about this project because it is now a substantially different project.
- Original there were 141 affordable rental units with 51 parking spaces then the land was subsequently sold to a new owner.The project then changed to 104 upscale condominiums with 81 stacked valet parking spaces.
- A Conditional Use was granted on one specific project and now it is arbitrarily transferred to a new owner.
- She feels that this is an important land use issue and the Commission should hear it again so the public can comment on it.
10.2004.0605R(A. VARAT: (415) 558-6405)
ANTENNAS ON THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY- GENERAL PLAN REFERRAL-Request for adoption of a resolution of General PlanConformityfinding, pursuant to Section 4.105 of the San Francisco Charter and Section 2A.53 of the Administrative Code, subject to the conditions of a Settlement and Public Rights-of-Way Use Agreement (Agreement), for siting certain types of micro-cellular equipment in public rights-of-way.The Agreement would permit the NextG Networks of California, Inc. to install up to 300 wireless antennae and associated equipment of various configurations on third-party-owned power poles, telephone poles and utility poles in public rights-of-way, but not on private property, throughout the City.Exact locations for antennae installations are not yet determined; however, installation locations will be limited by the Agreement, in consideration of urban design, historic resource, open space, visual resource and other factors.
Preliminary Recommendation: Adopt resolution of General Plan Conformity finding, subject to conditions of the Settlement and Public Rights-of-Way Use Agreement.
SPEAKEr(S):
(+) Suzanne Toller– Attorney - NextG Networks of California
- They have spent a lot of time working with various groups to try to reach an agreement with all the various concerns.
- They have limited the size of the facilities, the density, etc.

- It seems like they are adding more antenna sites but they are really replacing them.
- They will provide revenue to the City.
- He displayed drawings that were submitted to the department for their review.
(-) Eileen Boken – SPEAK
- She knows that Supervisor Amiano is working on WTS Guidelines so she would like this item to be continued indefinitely.
- NextG Networks does not hold an FCC License and it is not a wireless carrier, etc.
- If the City signs off on this agreement there will be no conditional use permit process.This means no public notification and no public hearings.
- Most of the photos and plans seem to be focused mostly in the Sunset District and the Richmond District.
(-) Diana Scott
- She is a resident of the Outer Sunset.
- She is opposed to this proposal even though there are certain restrictions.
- This proposal evades and magnifies the existing concerns regarding property values and human health.
- Even though the antennas are less visible it does not make them benign.
- This proposal should be put on hold until everything has been discussed.
ACTION:Found that the project is not in conformity with the General Plan.
