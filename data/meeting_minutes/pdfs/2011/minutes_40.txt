C.         COMMISSIONERSâ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
6.         Commission Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements.  Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may 
make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest 
to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take 
action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that 
could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of 
the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Moore:
Following up our discussion on the Housing Plan the other week, in an 
international survey, the statistics say that Australian homes are the most [the 
rest of the comment was not clear.]  It goes on to say that the United States in 
general is seen as the cheapest country given the amount of mass production we 
have in housing.  However, when it comes to looking at the prices in the United 
States, the most expensive communities in the country are San Francisco and San 
Jose, which toped the survey list as the least affordable housing market with 
home prices 5.1 times the household income, which is considered severely 
unaffordable.   I that that was very interesting because it puts another level 
of complexity in how we discuss affordable housing, and how we discuss housing 
per say.  I just wanted to bring that to your attention and I would be happy to 
email that to you.
Commissioner Miguel:
This week Iâve met with some of the Bartlet Street neighbors regarding an item 
that is on todayâs calendar.  On Monday and Tuesday, I had the pleasure of being 
a speaker at an international conference here in San Francisco on Electric 
Vehicle Infrastructure.  It has implications to an extent for Planning and to an 
extent for DBI because of our very old infrastructure in San Francisco of trying 
to shoehorn in what is going to be necessary to the roll out of electric 
vehicles.  Itâs interesting that they are presuming that the electric vehicles 
will be picked up by what they term early responders in the public.  But what 
they are looking at are the figures on Prius sales and other hybrid sales.  25% 
of all hybrid sales in the United States are in California.  We are dubbed the 
âearly adapters.â  Therefore, it is less of a problem in an area where it is ¾ 
single-family homes and you charge in your garage at night, but when you get 
into San Francisco where the majority of our population lives in rental housing 
and the majority of the rental housing is in multi-family buildings, we run into 
a very different situation.  It was a very interesting conference and something 
Iâm sure will come before us in the near future.
Commissioner Sugaya:
This last week I attended two meetings in Japantown.  One had to do with a 
community meeting on the issue of historic landmarks in the Japantown area.  It 
was informational to get input.  There was no consensus or decisions made at 
that point.  That will be fed into the Japantown Better Neighborhoods Plan that 
will be forth coming at the end of this year I think.  Secondly, it was more of 
a tour put on by Supervisor Mirkarimi to acquaint Mayor Lee with the issues in 
Japantown.  We had a walking tour of the area followed by a lunch at which 
different issues were discussed.  It was quite interesting because at the end of 
the lunch, the Mayor had taken notes on each of the issues and surprisingly 
committed himself to working on four of those issues and said that he would be 
following up with the community.
Commissioner Antonini:
Yesterday, Commissioner Sugaya and I were able to participate in one of the 
Design Review teamâs sessions.  It was very impressive.  They went through three 
projects very quickly and I think, very efficiently.  I got some idea about what 
kind of changes they will recommend on these.  Afterward we met with David 
Alumbaugh and other staff members regarding the public safety building on 3rdand Mission Rock.  Because it is a public building, it will not be before us for 
design review unlike other Mission Bay properties which are private.  But having 
seen some sketches in the Chronicle I thought it was important to weigh in if 
possible and the involved parties were very receptive to our comments.  Iâve 
already met with one of the architects that is involved.  If the public is 
interested, it is going to be before the Design Team of the Arts Commission.  It 
would be good to get in early on this; take a look at it; see if you like the 
way it looks; and comment accordingly so they can help to build something 
because it will stand out.  It will be something that will be very visible 
there.  It will include the Southern Station of the Police headquarters; a new 
fire station; the historic fire station will be renovated there.
Commissioner Borden:
I was just in Washington D.C. and I saw that they have installed their 
bike-sharing stations.  I know that the city had talked about bike sharing, and 
I just wondered if maybe we can have someone from MTA talk about their plans 
there.
Commissioner Moore:
I had to cancel the meeting with the Design Review team yesterday, but will 
reschedule.  This will allow other commissioners that havenât had the 
opportunity to also attend or participate with me.  She will come back with 
other dates for those who are interested.
7.Directorâs Announcements
Director Rahaim:
I just want to remind you that if you have any final comments on the Housing 
Element to try to get those to staff in the next few days if possible.  We would 
like to get you the final edited version about two weeks in advance of the 
hearing, which would be next Thursday.  Also, Iâd like to remind you that there 
is a special morning meeting on March 17thâ two weeks from today â 
as an informational hearing on Executive Park.  Last, I believe there was no 
Board of Appeals meeting this week so there is no report.
8.         Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of 
Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
LAND USE COMMITTEE of the BOARD OF SUPPERVISORS:
·Area Plan Waiver Criteria for Affordable Housing-.This proposed 
Ordinance would amend the existing waiver of certain Area Plan fees under 
certain conditions including if a project has affordable housing. The proposed 
changes contained in this Ordinance were considered by the Planning Commission 
on December 9, 2010, as part of a proposed Ordinance to amend to the Visitacion 
Valley Community Facilities and Infrastructure Fee and Fund (Board File No. 
101247). At that time, the Planning Department recommended that the legislation 
be approved as proposed but the Commission did not pass a recommendation other 
than a respectful recommendation that Supervisor Maxwell continue working with 
all parties on the issue of fees.This week the Committee recommended 
approval of the Ordinance to the Full Board.
FULL BOARD OF 
SUPERVISORS:
·136 Ord StreetCat Ex Appeal.This item was before the Planning Commission as a Discretionary Review.  The 
Commission approved the project on DR.  At the Full Board, the Corbett Heights 
Neighborhood Association and a neighbor were the appellants. They made three 
primary charges against the issuance of the Cat Ex.  I will summarize those 
charges and the Departmentâs response:
1.The Planning Department failed to 
conduct proper historic review of the subject property and the proposed project.The Department conducted an historic resource evaluation of 136 Ord Street in 
2008.  At that time, Preservation staff conducted a thorough analysis based upon 
research and historic records and concluded that the existing cottage is NOT a 
historic resource nor is the subject property located in a potential historic 
district. In 2009, when the project sponsor submitted his building permit 
application, he changed the scope of work from altering the existing cottage at 
the rear to constructing a new dwelling structure near the front of the 
property.  Since the Department had already conducted an historic resource 
evaluation in 2008 and already concluded there is no historic resource or a 
potential historic district present, there was no need to conduct another 
historic resource evaluation.
2.136 Ord Street is a historic resource.In order to qualify as a historic resource, the building must be significant 
under the California Register.  With the inability to meet any of the four 
criteria set forth under the California Register, 136 Ord Street is NOT a 
historic resource or that there would be a significant impact to off-site 
resources[1].
3.The proposed project will have a 
negative and âcumulativeâ impact to off-site historic resources.There is no substantial 
and/or credible evidence provided by the Appellant or in the record to support 
the conclusion that 136 Ord Street is located in a potential historic district[2].
Conclusion:  
The item had a lot of public comment, many in opposition as well as in support 
of the project.  The Board stated that the review process conducted by Planning 
could have been better but in the end the Board believed that Planning performed 
adequate analysis of the site and the neighborhood before arriving to their 
conclusion that the subject property is not a historic resource.The Board 
upheld the Cat Ex 11-0.
INTRODUCTIONS:
·Mayor Lee introduced Various Ordinances to Implement the Treasure Island Yerba 
Buena Redevelopment âIncluded among 
the legislation introduced is the Planning Code Amendment, the General Plan 
Amendment, and Zoning Map Amendment as well as the Development Agreement and the 
Redevelopment Plan Amendment.  These items are currently planed to be before 
this Commission in April.
BOARD OF APPEALS:
·The Board of Appeals heard a rehearing request for a variance at 1269 Lombard 
Street(note this is across the street from an item on your calendar for later today at 
1268 Lombard).  The case at the B of A, 1269 Lombard, was subject to a joint DR 
and variance hearing on June 24, 2010 - the Commission approved the project and 
Acting Zoning Administrator Rahaim granted the variance.
On December 15, 2010, the Board of Appeals upheld the subject variance (4-1).  
The rehearing request was filed on December 27, 2010 and initially scheduled for 
January 12, 2011.  The Appellant subsequently appealed the CEQA determination 
for the project, which was unanimously upheld by the Board of Supervisors.
Last night, the Board of Appeals denied the jurisdiction request (3-1-1).

[1]According to the appellant, the existing front 
		garden is an âunusual circumstance" and should be preserved.  It is the 
		Department's belief that development of small cottages at the rear of 
		the property and leaving the front as open space is actually a common 
		occurrence as it is typical for many owners to build small cottages at 
		the rear first and build a larger and more substantial dwelling at the 
		front of the property later when they are financially ready.  The 
		Department believes 136 Ord Street is one such case and therefore is not 
		unique, exceptional, or unusually.
[2]As stated, development at the rear of the 
		property, leaving the front for development in the future is a typical 
		pattern of residential development in the City and does not represent a 
		significant trend in local or regional history.  From an architectural 
		and/or urban design standpoint, the subject block lacks visual 
		continuity with varying building shapes, sizes, and architectural style, 
		and building front setbacks.  Contrary to the Appellantâs belief, 
		developing near the front of the property is actually more consistent 
		with the development pattern on the street and neighborhood.  As for 
		impact to off-site historic resources, the Planning Department 
		acknowledges that the adjacent property to the south at 140 Ord Street 
		is a historic but disagrees with the Appellant that the proposed project 
		will be an adverse impact.
