Treasure Island/Yerba Buena Island Project-Certification of the 
Final Environmental Impact Report- The project site is located on Treasure 
Island and Yerba Buena Island and the immediately surrounding waters (Assessors 
Block 1939, Lots 1 and 2). The proposed project would include development on 
Treasure Island and Yerba Buena Island of up to 8,000 residential units; up to 
140,000 square feet (sq. ft.) of new commercial and retail space; up to 100,000 
sq. ft. of new office space; adaptive reuse of three historic buildings on 
Treasure Island with up to 311,000 sq. ft. of commercial, retail, and/or flex 
space; about 500 hotel rooms; rehabilitation of the historic buildings on Yerba 
Buena Island; new and/or upgraded public and community facilities; new and/or 
upgraded public utilities; about 300 acres of parks and public open space 
including shoreline access and cultural uses such as a museum; new and upgraded 
streets and public ways; bicycle, transit, and pedestrian facilities; landside 
and waterside facilities for the Treasure Island Sailing Center; landside 
services for an expanded marina; and a new Ferry Terminal and intermodal Transit 
Hub.  Infrastructure improvements would include geotechnical stabilization to 
improve seismic safety.  The proposed project would also include green building 
specifications, programs to encourage transit use, design standards that would 
enable photovoltaic panel installation on most roofs, recycled water use, and 
other features promoting sustainability. Construction and build-out would be 
phased and would be anticipated to occur over an approximately 15- to 20-year 
period. The Draft EIR identifies potentially significant, unavoidable 
environmental impacts on aesthetics, historic architectural resources, 
transportation, noise, air quality, wind and biological resources.
Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the Final EIR
(Continued from 
the Regular Meeting of April 7, 2011)
Note: The Planning Commission does not conduct public review of 
Final EIRs. Public comments on the certification may be presented to the 
Planning Commission during the Public Comment portion of the calendar.
