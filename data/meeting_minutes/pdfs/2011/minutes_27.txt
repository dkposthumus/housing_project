Commissioners 
Antonini:
It is kind of 
a global question, and I certainly donât expect a response today, I just want to 
ask the question, it comes under the umbrella of the discussion often have about 
families leaving San Francisco, about citizens often relocating out of San 
Francisco, and one of the complaints you hear about is, problem with quality 
enjoyment, persue it of happiness and safety predictable passage, and the other 
day there was a demonstration and there were a lot hooded individuals, it seems 
to be an unorganized demonstration and of-course there was a lot blockage of 
streets, blockage of transit and eventually destruction of property, which some 
arrests were made.
I guess some 
parades have to get a permit, some demonstrations have to get permit, and other 
demonstrations that are spontaneous do not, I wonder what the City policy is, as 
to when a permit is necessary and when a demonstration is disrupted and not 
terminated even if it is blocking people passage often time for emergency 
situation, and it would seem like one is right of passage, would take precedent 
over one is rights of expression, it has to be some to compete with each other, 
and I have a question in regards to the Cityâs policy when the permit is 
necessary.
Commissioner 
Sugaya:
I attended the 
opening ceremony for the Powell Street Park, down on Union Square between Union 
Square and the Cable Car turn around, there are aluminum design, my personal 
feeling is a huge maintenance issue, I know the Union Street Merchants have a 
maintenance fund, but, for example the flooring material is gray aluminum, and 
there are already cigarettes buds falling thorough there, and paper being caught 
in it, it going to be continually be maintained.  I think between the opening 
day and yesterday when I walked by, I believe some of the barriers that they 
erected were aluminum, they already bent, out of line.
Commissioner 
Miguel:
I would like 
todayâs Commission hearing be adjourned in honor Anita Louise Avery, our 
Commission Secretaryâs sister, her services were last Monday, John was there, 
Jonas was there and other members of the Department were there as well.
The other 
thing, in todayâs Chronicle there was an article under health, and I actually 
caught a touch of one of the news show last night, regarding First Lady Michelle 
Obama campain against child obesity and the availability of healthy food, and 
while I mentioned Walmart, which we donât have in San Francisco, and also they 
mentioned Walgreens, which we do have, with the statement Walgreens Co. a 
nationwide drug store chain, still refers to drug store, will convert or open a 
thousand stores in areas that need healthy choices over the next 5 years, this 
is something that we talked about here, Commissioner Moore and I, particularly, 
engaged at the moment, the definition of drug stores or food stores wherever 
they may be is something that will have to be dealt in the very immediate 
future.
Commissioner 
Moore:
The issue over 
affordable housing or the lack of it, is not only an US discussion, there is one 
being raised in China and other fast growing countries in Asia, I just came back 
from a conference in Vietnam which was attended by the Ministry of Housing, 
Ministry of Construction and Ministry of Communication, as for the first time 
since Iâve been doing work in that country for many years, the Ministry talked 
openly about the lack of affordable housing, at this moment in China, Beijing 
and Shanghai, only a third of the population in large cities like Beijing and 
Shanghai, can afford to buy apartments, which are being built very rapidly, in 
Vietnam is a huge notice, the lack of affordable housing, this is from countries 
that have centralized governance quiet different from our own, and they are 
saying the market is not providing enough affordable housing.  I like to share 
with you what they are trying to do, and again when you have a different form of 
government, which they definitely do, they are handling a little bit different, 
but they also lack the means to really bring that housing type to market.
7.         Directorâs 
Announcements
Director Rahaim:
I just want to 
bring to your attention, that we are doing an on-line survey about our public 
outreach and process, that will be live tomorrow, in our own web page, and will 
be up for about 3 weeks, this survey will be use to help us to better inform and 
involve the public in different efforts and projects of the Department. 
Primarily, the current practices develop a vision and goal around public 
outreach and engagement, and look it different ways in doing that part of our 
work.
Second thing I 
want to mention is, in your package today, you will be receiving a twenty-five 
year record of the Downtown Plan, the Downtown Plan was twenty five years old 
last year actually, it is essentially a compilation for our factual annual 
report that we do on the plan, it does compile all in one document and it is a 
very accurate document and staff would like to give a full report in the future, 
and we are looking at a date in October to have a public hearing on that report.
8.Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of 
Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
LAND USE COMMITTEE:
§LAST WEEK Hearing - Regulations for Issuing Excavation Permit for the 
Installation of Surface-Mounted Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way.Supervisor Wienerâs 
Inquiry focused on DPWâs Surface-Mounted Facilities Work Order to see if it was 
consistent with the General Plan and Betters Streets Plan.  Staff informed the 
Committee that the Work Order was consistent and offered a strong set of 
guidelines but could be strengthened.  The BSP set in motion mechanisms for 
better coordination between agencies.  The City is improving on this front but 
coordination can always be improved.  Our suggestions for strengthening 
guidelines include:  1) adding sidewalk widenings as a way to accommodate 
surface-mounted utilities; 2) where appropriate use surface-mounted utility 
installations to help build improvements envisioned in the BSP; and 3) based on 
public testimony at the hearing staff could review minimum sidewalk widths to 
ensure the Work Order complies with BSP.While this hearing was Informational 
Only, the Committee seemed to suggest that City Agencies consider these items 
and seek coordination as early in the review process as possible.
§Limited Live Performance.Commissioners, you heard 
this item on July 7.  This Ordinance would to create a Limited Live Performance 
Permit for indoor locales whose primary function is not presentation of live 
performances.  At that time, you recommended approval with modifications. You 
requested that the Ordinance be amended to extend the opportunity for 
small-scale entertainment to be considered an accessory use in the SOMA Mixed 
Use Districts, the SOMA NCT, West Portal, and Pacific Avenue neighborhood 
commercial districts - districts in which entertainment is not currently 
permitted. In addition, you recommended that any restrictions on the visibility 
of entertainment from public rights-of-way be removed, as well as any 
requirement that doors and windows be closed while the accessory performances 
are underway.  At this weekâs hearing Supervisor Mirkarimi indicated that he 
would incorporate all of your modifications, except one.  On the request of 
Supervisor Kim, he will amend the Ordinance so that it allows this entertainment 
use in the SoMa mixed Use Districtsâbut only in the areas not involved in the 
Western SoMa Community Planning Process.  There was some discussion of this 
issue as Supervisor Wiener agreed with the Commission recommendation to include 
all of the SoMa Mixed Use Districts, including Western SoMa. Also, under disIn the end, the Committee made the modifications as requested by Supervisor 
Mirkarimi and Kim and the Ordinance was continued to next week as amended.
§Inner, Outer Clement and Geary NC Controls.Commissioners, you heard 
this item sponsored by Supervisor Mar on July 14, at that time you recommended 
approval with modifications.  This Ordinance would amend restaurant controls in 
Inner and Outer Clement so that the controls were âtippingâ controls that could 
flip between âpermittedâ and conditionally permitted depending on concentration 
levels.  The Ordinance would exchange a prohibition on âlarge, fast food 
restaurantsâ on portions of Geary for a prohibition on Formula Retail 
restaurants in the same area.  It would also prohibit Formula Retail Pet Supply 
Stores; permit video stores; and allow a 5â height bonus for active uses.  Due 
to ongoing CEQA analysis of this last component the Supervisor modified the 
legislation to remove the height bonus.  You recommended a few minor 
modifications and two substantial modifications.  First you recommended to 
replace the âtippingâ controls with consistent controls that would permit one 
additional restaurant in the Inner Clement and then allow additional restaurants 
in both the Inner and Outer Clement by CU.  The Supervisor accommodated this 
request as it still is a relaxation from the existing controls. Second, you 
recommended to remove the prohibition on Formula Retail Pet Supply Stores. 
Although Supervisor Mar did not remove this prohibition, there was discussion of 
this at the Committee.  Supervisor Wiener agreed with your position.After 
discussion, the Committee accepted Supervisor Marâs modifications and continued 
the Ordinance to next week as amended.
RULES COMMITTEE:
LAST WEEK Hearing on Ballot 
Initiative on a Planning Code Amendment that would Prohibit the Demolition of 
Residential Buildings.This hearing was last week.  
At the hearing, our Director went over the mechanics of the proposed Initiative, 
technical issues, and potential policy implications.  The Director stated that 
as drafted, the Initiative appears to have a number of errors and 
inconsistencies.  He advised that this lack of clarity and precision could cause 
problems with the implementation of the Initiative and potential results that 
are different than those intended by voters.Due to the fact that this item 
is scheduled to be put before the voters this Fall, neither the Department nor 
the Commission can take a position on this item.
FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
§BUDGET.This week the Board unanimously passed the Cityâs Budget.  This included not 
only our Department budget but also the trailing legislation for the associated 
fee updates.
§BF 110277 
Vintage Signs.This 
week the Full Board considered Supervisor Camposâs Ordinance that would allow 
for more types of signs to be covered under the historic sign ordinance.  You 
heard this item on June 2 at which time you recommended approval with 
modifications.   Supervisor Campos incorporated your recommendations into the 
proposed legislation and chose the word âvintageâ to replace the word 
âhistoric.âThe item, as amended, was passed on first reading Tuesday.
§110627 General Plan Amendment - Community Safety Element.This Ordinance added 
language to the Community Safety Element of the General Plan to reference the 
most recent Hazard Mitigation Plan. This amendment ensures the City and County 
of San Francisco will qualify for additional funding enabled through California 
Assembly Bill AB 2140, for certain disaster recovery projects.  This Commission 
had recommended approval of the Ordinance.This week the Board approved the 
Ordinances on first reading.
§CEQA Cat Ex Appeal of AT&T's Lightspeed Project -After three continuances, 
the Board affirmed the Categorical Exemption for the AT&T Lightspeed project by 
a vote of 6 to 5 despite another motion for continuance in order to provide 
further review of AT&T's Memorandum of Understanding with DPW.  Some Supervisors 
continued to raise environmental concerns that the 726 proposed Lightspeed 
cabinets could result in project-specific and cumulative significant impacts and 
that an EIR was required. But ultimately it was non-CEQA-related commitments by 
AT&T that convinced the majority to vote to uphold the CEQA determination.  AT&T 
committed to additional public and district supervisor notification and 
involvement, above and beyond DPW's Surface Mounted Facilities Order 
requirements, among other items.
INTRODUCTIONS:
Board of Appeals:
The Board of 
Appeals heard one item that would be of interest to the Commission - 1787 Union 
Street (dba The Brickhouse).  The subject project (outdoor patio front of a 
restaurant) was before the Planning Commission as a DR on January 20, 2011.  At 
this hearing the Commission unanimously approved the project with conditions, 
including limitations on seating, hours of operation and the number of doors 
that could remain open to the outdoor seating area.  The Board of Appeals heard 
the matter and believed that additional measures could be adopted to address 
neighbor concerns regarding noise.  The Board voted to continue the item to 
August 10, 2011, and directed the Permit Holder to investigate alternative 
methods for addressing the noise issues (including, but not limited to, changing 
the operation of the doors to the patio).

Gate Park Landmark designation effort, as well as the proposed Duboce Park
