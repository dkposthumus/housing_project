C.COMMISSION MATTERS
6.Commission Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements.Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Richards:
I guess, three things, first, it seem like lately we have been having a lot of DRs that I think we have been taking a higher percent of them, than usual. And one of the things that I have been thinking of was actually taking a look at the Residential Design Guidelines, to really understand whether or not they are too generic and maybe they don't suit where we are today and maybe need to consider topography and also the age of the neighborhood. It's something that has been on my mind. The other item was the driveway policy. I think that it would be a great idea to have an informational sometime in January on that before a lot more of these projects come before us so that the public is pretty well informed on decision-making process that the Department goes through on those and the Commission as well. And the third thing I'm on a little bit more of a personal item on my way into City Hall today, Board President Katy Tang stopped me and she gave me this Certificate of Honor. My mother sitting in the audience there, raise your hand, she is celebrating 90 years on Sunday and she decided to come out across the country to celebrate it in soggy San Francisco. So, the Board of Supervisors chose to make you an honorary citizen of San Francisco. I’ll bring this home when I come home.
Commissioner Wu:
Wonderful. Happy 90th, Mrs. Richards.
7.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Good afternoon Commissioners, Happy Birthday, Mrs. Richards and welcome. Two things that I wanted to mention -- actually three. On the Residential Design Guidelines that Commissioner Richards brought up, the Department staff has been working for over a year now on all of the Department's guidelines, and there is a list of more than I can remember how many different sets of guidelines there are in the City, and the idea is to coordinate them to update the Residential Design Guidelines. We expect to get that to you sometime middle to -- middle of next year into summer/fall of next year. So you should be seeing those updated guidelines in the next few months. Secondly, I wanted to mention a change to a couple of process in department, particularly around small projects. One of the things that is happening in the current development boom is that there is a lot of small projects that typically would only take a few weeks or a few months to approve are getting substantially delayed because of all of the permit activity coming in, so we have established with -- we have been given permission to hire some staff to actually focus only on small projects and we have a small projects team that is now made up of four people and we are looking for four more and their entire focus will be on small building permit projects, projects that typically don't even require CEQA or don't require Commission action that normally can be approved quite quickly and they will be focusing solely on those small projects. So, that the planners can work on focus on the larger ones, and the smaller projects don't have to wait in such a long queue. The other piece of the process that I think I mentioned before was that with respect to the PPA, the Preliminary Project Assessment process, we had been -- the way the process had been working is that we had asked the project sponsors to apply for that and we gave them a letter in 60 days after the application and then they were applying for their environmental review. In light of the queue and backlog we have changed that policy to allow them to apply for their environmental application at the same time as the PPA so that the wait is less by two to three months, that would have been otherwise, so again, it’s an effort to reduce the backlog and get people assigned to projects as soon as possible. The third thing I wanted to mention was the Environmental Impact Report for the 5th and Mission Project, the 5M Project. I think there was a lot of discussion here last week about the timeframe. We are indeed extending the timeframe as the Commission requested until January 7th, which was I believe the date you talked about. I think more pertinently, you will receive in your packet today a memo from Sarah Jones the Environmental Review Officer about the process for extending the deadlines and there have been a little bit of confusion, on how it happens? Who is responsible for extending deadlines?And we'll calendar that as an item on next week's calendar under Director's report, so that we can have a discussion with Sarah and the Commission. That concludes misreport. Thank you.
