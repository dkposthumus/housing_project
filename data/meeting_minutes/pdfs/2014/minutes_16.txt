Commissioner Wu:
I wanted to update the other Commissioners, Commissioner Johnson and I attended the Mayor’s Housing Task Force meeting on Tuesday and we will be getting a briefing here at the Commission, either late November or early December.
Commissioner Antonini:
I have a couple of items, the first of which, is a quote from a book that I'm reading, I think is fantastic. It is called Supreme City and the subject matter is how Jazz Aged Manhattan; Manhattan of the 20s changed America for good, in so many ways, and the quote from this particular chapter says: “Talented people want to be near other talentedpeople and the miracle of New York is that it has the physical compactness to make that possible,” and we could use that same quotation today, substituting San Francisco, because that is one of the things that’s leading to the growth, both commercially and residentially in San Francisco,because there is a desire on the parts of lots of people to be close to each other, even though we have alltheseelectronic means of communication they physically want to be around other people that they can share thing with and work together. So anyway, a couple of other items without commenting on the case itself,because it is under appeal, the decision by US District Judge Charles Breyer regarding the fee that ischarged on cases where a tenant is evicted and actually, the justice had ruled that was unconstitutional, buthis arguments without going into those, are very similar to what we are always admonished to take into consideration on land use issues, making sure that there's a nexus between of what the impact of a project is and the fee that is charged. It should be responsible for mitigating it's part of the impact on a problem on the types of things that the new project does, but not to remediate existing problems or be responsible in full for what has many other causes, most of high percentage of whether, from other reasons, so I’m not commenting on the decision itself, but I do find an interesting parallel, and it would remain to be seen on appeal whether this parallel is upheld or overturned. Oh my third item is in regards to an article in the Chronicle regarding 181 Fremont, which we passed last week and I think properly and I believe it's now before the Board of Supervisors for their approval, and the article was written, not without too much mention of what we had done in our actions, but kind of talked about the proposal before the Supervisors, which I think is a win-win and almost everybody is in support of it, because it allows the building of many more units than would be the case if only a small number of units are -people are lucky enough to get some very expensive units and they have to be built in the Transbay, the funds have to be use for affordable units within the Transbay project and then a day later there's an editorial in the paper, which it sounded like the writer didn't understand the issues, because it was entitled “Transit Maybe” and it was somewhat critical of this legislation, which is proposed by Supervisor Jane Kim and it implied that we were trading these units or units of this type for displacing the inclusionary housing far from the center of transit, which is not the case. They are obliged to have it within the area, so all it would do is to move the residents possibly a little over a block away because the border of Transbay is Folsom and 181 Fremont is right near Howard, just separated by Town Hall from Howard Street, and so that’s as far away from transit that it could be moved and whether or not, they also sort made it sound like this legislation would apply to other projects, I don’t know whether it could or not. I think it is focused on just this project so I hate to be critical, but it sounds like the writer or the editorial didn't understand what the project is and what the legislation is. The article on the project itself was a little bit more comprehensive and I think more accurate.
Commissioner Fong:
Thank you. I want to bring up something that’s maybe a little bit of a long-range thought and oftentimes at commissioner comments like this, where we're talking about and making request for either further information, moredata,a report back on something and I know those kinds of requests are very time intensive for staff and I want to talk about, maybe, in the future, we are able to prioritize some of those items on that list and whether there's may be through a subcommittee or maybe even an agendized item, we can talk a little bit about what’s the highest priority, if we are going to have staff spend some time, significant time on some of these requests for data to help us make better decisions down the road, what those top three items are, whether they are transit related or housing related, etc.I don't think it’s something we can really get into that today, but I wanted to throw the idea out, obviously talk to the staff about it and what the rational way to go about that is, clearly with my intent of collecting data, building more information to help us all make better decisions for the long range.
Commissioner Richards:
I'd love to participate in any one of those conversations. I think we should probably say within 30-60 days we get something going. Also, what the process would be for prioritizing for whatever it is we are asking for, so I’d love to participate. Thank you.
6.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Good afternoon Commissioners, if I may just on Commissioner Antonini's point on 181 Fremont, what the Board is acting on is an amendment to the Development Agreement and that only applies to that site, so it cannot be used more broadly in the Transbay District.Secondly, on Commissioner Fong's request, I appreciate that very much. I think, what I have talked to Jonas about is organizing your requests in a way that we can look at them collectively and look at how we can prioritize some of those requests. There are very legitimate requests coming in. Just by their nature they're an addition to our existing work plan, so I appreciate your acknowledgment of that and we are happy to talk through with you, how much they’ll take and how we can prioritize those, so we can have that discussion in the next few weeks. And thirdly, I just also wanted to thank Commissioners Wu and Johnson for their involvement in the Mayor’s Office Housing Task Force. I think there’ve been an interesting series of discussions there. We are working on scheduling an item I think in early December at this point to go over the full range of housing initiatives that are underway in the City right now so that we can have a more robust discussion with the Commission about those efforts in the coming months. That concludes my report. Thank you.
7.Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission
LAND USE COMMITTEE:
·141006.Interim Zoning Controls - New Ground Floor Office Uses Facing 2nd Street, from King and Folsom Street. Sponsor Kim.This is a Resolution imposing interim zoning controls requiring conditional use authorization for new office uses facing 2nd Street, from King to Folsom Streets, for eighteen months.This item was not staffed and because it is an interim Ordinance it will not come before this Commission.However, should Supervisor Kim pursue permanent controls, those will come before this commission for your review and recommendation.The Land Use Committee unanimously sent this item to the full board with a positive recommendation.
·120796.Planning Code, Zoning Map - Establishing the Divisadero Street Neighborhood Commercial District and Deleting the Divisadero Street Restricted Use District.Sponsor Breed
·120814.Planning Code, Zoning Map - Establishing the Fillmore Street Neighborhood Commercial District. Sponsor Breed.
These Ordinances would create the Divisidero and Fillmore NCDs.  They were originally heard by the Planning Commission in Nov 2012, where the Commission voted to recommend approval of the proposed Ordinances with modifications.  The Ordinances were reintroduced by the district Supervisor in Feb 2013, incorporating the Commissions modifications along with a proposed ban on formula retail.  In June 2013 the Commission heard the reintroduced Ordinances and voted to recommend approval with modification to the BOS.  The principle modification was to remove the proposed formula retail ban and other language regarding formula retail applications.
Supervisor Breed did remove the additional Formal Retail controls from these Ordinances prior to bringing them to the Land Use Committee.
At the Land Use Committee public comment was overwhelmingly in support of the proposed Ordinances, citing the changes in the Ordinances as positive for the small business community in the two commercial corridors.  Supervisor Weiner made a motion to forward the Ordinances to the Full Board; the Land Use Committee voted 3-0 with no additional comment.
·120881.Planning Code, Zoning Map - Uses, Conformity of Uses, Parking Requirements for Uses, and Special Use Districts. Sponsor Chiu.Otherwise known as the NE Ordinance, or Mega Leg, this Ordinance made a number of changes to parking, use, and sign controls primarily in the NE area of the city.Portions of this Ordinance have already been adopted by the Board and integrated into the Planning Code, which some parts, such as sign controls and issues dealing with Port Property, have not been to the Land Use Committee yet.The Ordinance that was before the Committee this week addressed the following issues:
1.Facilitate the conversion of historic buildings and nonconforming uses in existing buildings to housing.
2.Update the requirements for accessory uses in Commercial and Residential Commercial districts.
3.Rationalize changes of use in NC districts.
4.Make parking requirements consistent in transit-rich certain districts of the city.
5.Allowing parking lots in the C-3 to obtain a 5-year temporary use permit instead of a 2-year temporary use permit.
6.Add a grandfathering clause that allows projects that have already been approved by the Planning Commission but not yet vested to be exempt from any parking requirement changes on Van Ness Avenue.
This Commission held multiple hearings on this Ordinance, eventually splitting up the 540 page Ordinance into 3 different phases.The Commission heard the issues taken up by the LU Committee this week in May 2012 as part of Phases 2 and 3.  For both Ordinances, the Planning Commission voted to recommend approval of the ordinances with modification.  All of the Commission’s recommended modifications were incorporated in the revised Ordinance that was before the LU Committee this Monday.
At that hearing, there was no public comment on the items.  Prior to any discussion between the presiding Supervisors, the sponsoring Supervisor’s aide requested (1) an amendment to the whole to correct a formatting error in the proposed Ordinance and (2) a continuance of the item for one week (to Oct 27).   Sup Wiener moved both requests and both were approved 3-0.With any luck these items will finally move on to the full board next week.
·141023.Development Agreement - 181 Fremont Street, LLC - 181 Fremont Street - Transbay Redevelopment Project Area. Sponsor Mayor and Kim.This item was a Development Agreement between the City and the project sponsor of 181 Fremont Street to exempt the project from the on-site affordable housing requirements, and to enable an in-lieu fee payment ($13.85m) for the development of affordable housing in the Transbay Redevelopment Project Area.Planning Commission heard the item last Thursday (10/16), and voted unanimously to recommend approval to the BOS. No amendments were made.
The Development Agreement would require that the Sponsor contribute $13.85 million dollars. By comparison, if the Sponsor were to pay the in-lieu fee established by Section 415, the fee amount would be approximately $5.4 million dollars.The process created by the Development Agreement could create up to 69 affordable units, compared to the 11 affordable units that would be provided within the Project under current requirements.Sup. Kim also expressed that our current in-lieu fee for a typical project (subject to Section 415) may be set too low.  The Committee voted unanimously to send this item to the full Board with a positive recommendation.
FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
This past Tuesday, the Giants had their first win over the Kansas City Royals during the first game of the World Series and the Board of Supervisors had its second read of the Short-term Rental Ordinance.
·Short-Term Rentals. Commissioners, you may recall that you heard this item on August 7.At that time you recommended approval with 16 amendments to be made to the legislation after a 6 hour hearing. The Board’s Land Use Committee held two 7 hour hearings on the ordinance and made multiple amendments. This week the full board has its second reading.Typically Second readings are merely procedural; however this week some Supervisors attempted one last time to amend the Ordinance.
Supervisor Avalos proposed an amendment to limit both hosted and non-hosted rentals to 90-days; this was seconded by Supervisor Campos.Supervisor Campos proposed an amendment to require that they city collect back taxes prior to the new rules taking affect; this amendment was seconded by Supervisor Avalos.And, Supervisor Yee proposed an Amendment to limit both no hosted and hosted short-term rentals in RH-1 D districts to 90 days; this amendment was seconded by Supervisor Mar.All of these amendments failed by a 6 to 5 vote.Several Supervisors spoke for and against the amendments, some very passionately.Many of those who spoke in favor of the amendments cited Senator Feinstein’s recent Op Ed in the Chronicle, which voiced opposition to the new law.At the end of a 45 minute hearing, the Ordinance passed its second read on a 7 to 4 vote.This item is now awaiting the Mayor’s signature.
INTRODUCTIONS:There were no introductions this week. However, we had a request to go over an Ordinance that was introduced on October 7 of this year by Supervisors Campos and Farrell to establish a legacy business program.
·141038 Administrative Code - Legacy Business Registry, Rebate Program, and Establishing Fees. Sponsor Campos.The Ordinance would amend the Administrative Code to direct the Small Business Commission to establish and maintain a registry of Legacy Businesses in San Francisco.A “Legacy Business” is a business that meets four criteria:
1.It is a bar, restaurant, retail store, arts space, performance venue, or a business primarily engaged in Production, Distribution, and Repair activities.
2.It has operated in San Francisco for 30 or more years, with no break in San Francisco operations exceeding two years.
3.It has contributed to the neighborhood’s history and/or the identity of a particular neighborhood or community; and,
4.It is committed to maintaining the physical features or traditions that define the business, including craft, culinary or art forms.
The ordinance would require the Small Business Commission to survey San Francisco’s Legacy Businesses and, no later than June 30, 2015, make substantive recommendationsto the Board of Supervisors for programs for Legacy Businesses. Such programs could include business and technical assistance, lease renewal and acquisition assistance, public education and commendation initiatives to recognize and honor the contributions of Legacy Businesses to San Francisco, financial incentives to encourage the stability of Legacy Businesses, and additional business stabilization and neighborhood continuity initiatives.
The proposal would establish a rebate program for Legacy Businesses that purchase the real property from which they operate their businesses. The program would also provide rebates to “Qualified Landlords,” meaning persons that purchase real property from which Legacy Businesses operate their businesses and that extend the term of the Legacy Businesses’ leases by at least an additional ten years. The total combined rebates paid to all Qualified Legacy Businesses and Qualified Landlords in any one year would not exceed $400,000. The rebate program would expire by operation of law at midnight on December 31, 2019, unless extended by ordinance.
Commissioners, as this item does not amend the Planning Code it will not be coming to you for a hearing unless you should request one.

PACIFIC ROD AND GUN CLUB UPLAND SOIL REMEDIAL ACTION PROJECT- The project site is located at 520 John Muir Drive in San Francisco-Appeal of Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declarationfor The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) proposal to implement the Pacific Rod and Gun Club Upland Soil Remedial Action Plan (the “project”), which would clean up soil contamination at the Pacific Rod and Gun Club (PRGC), located on the southwest side of Lake Merced in San Francisco, California. Soil contamination is the result of the former use of lead shot and clay targets made with asphaltic materials at the skeet and trap shooting ranges. The SFPUC prepared the PRGC Remedial Action Plan (RAP) in response to a Cleanup Order issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, San Francisco Bay Region (RWQCB). The project consists of excavation and appropriate off-site disposal of up to 46,500 cubic yards of soils containing elevated concentrations of lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and backfilling of excavated areas with clean fill material.
