Opportunity SUD (Special Use District), and 40-X Height and Bulk District. The Planning Department found that 
the project is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Pursuant to Chapter 31 of the San

dated November 21, 2019 was based. Therefore, no additional environmental review is required.
