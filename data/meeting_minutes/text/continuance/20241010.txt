1101-1123 SUTTER STREET – south side between Larkin and Polk Streets; Lots 001 and 019 in Assessor’s Block 
0692 (District 3) – Request to modify Conditional Use Authorization that was approved by the Planning 
Commission on March 24, 2022 through Motions No. 21091 and 21092 by 1) modifying the previously approved 
Conditional Use Authorization as a Pipeline Project, pursuant to Planning Code Section 415A, to reduce the On-
Site Affordable Housing rate to 12% and the Affordable Housing Fee rate to 16.4%; 2) modifying the previously 
approved Conditional Use Authorization by extending the performance period; and 3) making Findings under 
the Individually Requested State Density Bonus Program (Sec. 206.6), pursuant to California Government Code 
Section 65915, to achieve a 64.67% density bonus, requesting seven waivers for rear yard (Sec. 134), residential 
open space (Sec. 135), above-grade parking setback (Sec. 145), off-street loading (Sec. 152), height (Sec. 260), 
narrow streets and alleys (Sec. 261.1), and bulk (Sec. 270); and two incentives/concessions for non-residential 
use size limits (Sec. 121.2) and restrictions of lot mergers (Sec. 121.7). The revised project proposes the demolition 
of a surface parking lot and an existing two-story commercial building at 1123 Sutter Street and construction of 
a new 22-story, 235-foot-tall building that will provide 303 rental dwelling units. On June 11, 2024, the Planning 
Department issued an addendum to the previously certified EIR that evaluates the potential environmental 
effects of the revised project compared to the impacts identified in the final EIR. The Project is within the Polk 
Street NCD (Neighborhood Commercial District), Priority Equity Geographies SUD (Special Use District), and 130-
E and 65-A Height and Bulk Districts.
