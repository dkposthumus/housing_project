PRESERVATION DESIGN STANDARDS – Request for consideration to Adopt Preservation Design Standards for 
Additions and Modifications to Existing Historic Buildings (PDS), requiring projects subject to the Housing 
Accountability Act (HAA) to comply with the proposed objective preservation standards in addition to standards 
contained in the Planning Code. The PDS will apply to projects at category A properties that have been 
determined to be individually significant or are contributors to historic districts. The PDS are one part of the 
evolving compendium of San Francisco Design Standards and provides objective standards related to Existing 
Features, Site Design, and Architecture. Projects that are not subject to HAA will continue to be subject to the 
City’s adopted design guidelines and discretionary preservation review under the Secretary of the Interior’s 
Standards of Rehabilitation, and will also be evaluated against the PDS, where applicable.
