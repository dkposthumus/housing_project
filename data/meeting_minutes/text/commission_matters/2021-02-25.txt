Commission Comments/Questions 
 
 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
If you would indulge me for just one moment Commissioners. I am pleased to announce 
that Laura Lynch of the Planning Department had accepted my offer to join the Office of 
Commission Affairs as our new manager. So, welcome Laura and today is her official start 
date. So, when she ramps up, I will be taking some time off and sheâ€™ll be acting in my stead.
