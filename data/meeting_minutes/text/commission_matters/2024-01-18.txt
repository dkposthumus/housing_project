5. LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 
President Tanner: 
Thank you. I want to finally do something that I said I was gonna do a year ago, which is make a schedule for the 
Land Acknowledgment to share the duty amongst those of us who want to do that. So, it just has each 
Commission hearing and then someone's name next to it. And then a slightly easier to read version of the Land 
Acknowledgment. And this folder will just be back there with our little snack and name tag cabinet. So, if you 
want to take a look at it later on, if you're not interested, you can just cross yourself out. And the only order is just 
alphabetically, I think. And goes it goes basically me to everybody and then comes back around. So, it's just 
repeating. So anyhow, there's that little housekeeping for the land acknowledgment and I'll happy to share it 
today.  
The Planning Commission acknowledges that we are on the unceded ancestral homeland of the Ramaytush 
Ohlone, who are the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula. As the indigenous stewards of this land 
and in accordance with their traditions, the Ramaytush Ohlone have never ceded, lost, nor forgotten their 
responsibilities as the caretakers of this place, as well as for all peoples who reside in their traditional territory. As 
guests, we recognize that we benefit from living and working on their traditional homeland. We wish to pay our 
respects by acknowledging the ancestors, elders, and relatives of the Ramaytush Ohlone community and by 
affirming their sovereign rights as first peoples.
