Commission Comments/Questions 
 
 
 
Commissioner Tanner: 
I just wanted to recognized that this past Monday was in honor of Dr. Rev. Martin Luther 
King Jr. and I know that I had some events, that became virtual events, that weren’t in person 
due to the surge, but I hope that folks had a chance to reflect on his legacy and especially in 
this Commission that is so committed to equity and a Department that is looking towards 
equity. I think, even thought that it was many decades ago, unfortunately that he was 
assassinated, his legacy is very long, a very very long shadow, because I learned so much 
from looking back at his work and the work of those who worked alongside of him. So I hope 
you had a chance to do that, and are able to stay safe while doing it. Thank you.
