Commission Comments/Questions 
 
Commissioner Moore:   
I would like to welcome commissioner Chan to the commission. It's a very unusual way of 
starting, but perhaps that forges strong bonds between all of us. Welcome to the group.   
 
Commissioner Chan:   
I just want to say thank you. Hello, everyone. It's great to be with you virtually today. Just 
want to extend a brief thank you and appreciation to Director Hillis and the Planning staff 
for taking time to provide key things for all the projects before our calendar today and 
Secretary Ionin for his help in getting me set up for this role. Other than that, I am just 
looking forward to working with my fellow commissioners and to the day when we can all 
meet in person.
