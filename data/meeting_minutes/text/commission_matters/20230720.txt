Land Acknowledgement 
 
President Tanner: 
Thank you, Commissioners. I will be sharing the Land Acknowledgment today. 
 
The Planning Commission acknowledges that we are on the unceded ancestral homeland 
of the Ramaytush Ohlone, who are the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula. 
As the indigenous stewards of this land and in accordance with their traditions, the 
Ramaytush Ohlone have never ceded, lost, nor forgotten their responsibilities as the 
caretakers of this place, as well as for all peoples who reside in their traditional territory. As 
guests, we recognize that we benefit from living and working on their traditional 
homeland. We wish to pay our respects by acknowledging the Ancestors, Elders, and 
Relatives of the Ramaytush Ohlone community and by affirming their sovereign rights as 
First Peoples.

Commission Comments/Questions 
 
 
 
President Tanner: 
I will just say, in the capacity of a different job that I have, I got to tour a project site. This is 
the condos that we approved across from the palms a few years ago and it’s under 
construction to be 550 or 505, I can’t remember now, units for sale, which is really exciting. 
and I got to go down into the site. So, things are happening. And around the corner is an 
office building that is also under construction, being built on spec, so we’ll see if they get a 
tenant. But it was good to just see folks out working and just feeling a little bit of like, okay 
there are still things happening and moving in the city even if we can focus sometimes 
that what we don’t have, like all the projects in the pipeline but there are projects that we 
have approved that have gotten underway. So, it was really good to be out there and see 
that.
