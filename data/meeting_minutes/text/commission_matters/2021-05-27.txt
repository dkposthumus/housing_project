Commission Comments/Questions 
 
 
Commissioner Tanner: 
Commissioners and members of the public, I just want to presence that this past week 
marked the one-year anniversary of George Floyd's murder at the hands of police officers, 
which as we know touched off a range of protests and policy changes at local levels, at 
state levels, changes here and it continues to inspire a lot of movement towards advancing 
racial equity and justice in America. So , I just want to presence that. It has been a fast year, 
a year full of lots of changes for all of us, personally, professionally, socially, every kind of 
civically, every level and continue to be more changes to come. But I hope that we can 
keep alive our Commission’s commitment to equity and racial equity and we keep making 
strides forward. Also, I want to commend the staff who have been working so diligently on 
that. And we do see it coming through in our staff reports and other activities. So, a long 
road ahead but we are continuing to make progress. And I also just want to note,
