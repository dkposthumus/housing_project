7. COMMISSION COMMENTS/QUESTIONS 
Commissioner Williams: 
Thank you. I’d like to read a letter that was sent to us Commissioners. This letter is from United to Save the 
Mission, the Latino Task Force, San Francisco Latino Parity and Equity Coalition, Plaza 16 Coalition, the American 
Indian Cultural District of San Francisco, and Calle 24. This is regarding a hearing for 2588 Mission Street and the 
letter reads - 
 
Dear Planning Commissioners- 
Multiple Discretionary Review Requests have been submitted for the proposed project at 2588 Mission Street 
and our coalitions request that the hearing for these DRPs be held in the Mission community to allow for 
meaningful, authentic and equitable participation in the planning process. The San Francisco Planning 
Department has stated a “commitment to racial and social equity a core tenet of our values, culture, and 
institutional practices. We believe the Department has a responsibility to work toward changing structures and 
policies in order to achieve racially and socially equitable outcomes in San Francisco.” In its Resolution No. 20738, 
the Planning Commission apologized for the “history of inequitable planning policies that have resulted in racial 
disparities” and “ inequitable treatment or opportunities” for communities such as the Mission. Given these 
commitments, the fact that the Planning Commission has removed remote public comment from public 
hearings, and the reasonable precedent set with previous hearings held in the Mission – the San Francisco 
Planning Commission hearing for 1979 Mission Street on February 7, 2018, and the San Francisco Human Rights 
Commission hearing on May 8, 2017 - we urge you as Planning Commissioners to recognize the value of 
including community voices and expand opportunities for community engagement by holding this hearing in 
the Mission. The 2588 Mission Street site has a long and beloved history in our community as an anchor of 
culturally distinct businesses that reflect the American Indian, Indigenous and Latinx communities that they 
served and as rent controlled housing for beloved neighbors, including the person who died in the fire on 
January 28, 2015. The proposed project at this site is not ordinary, being one of the largest proposed projects in 
the Mission, and given its size and scale, will recast and forever alter this area at the heart of the community. 
Therefore, it is critical that residents have an equitable ability to participate in the hearing as an integral part of 
the planning process and their self-determination. Bringing this hearing to a welcoming public location in the 
community is the right thing to do. We ask that you respond to our request in a timely fashion. We are also 
offering our assistance in securing a location, childcare provisions and interpretation services. 
Sincerely, 
United to Save the Mission 
The San Francisco Latino Task Force 
The San Francisco Latino Parity and Equity Coalition 
Plaza 16 Coalition 
The American Indian Cultural District and Calle 24 Latino Cultural District

Is there any comment from Planning or - 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Commissioner, we’re also in receipt of that letter. And you and I spoke too. I think there is, it's up to you 
ultimately. I mean, I think we should take this up probably in the officers meeting to talk about it. We've done 
it, I know once before in the past, around a project in the Mission at 16th and Mission. I was on the Commission 
at the time. So, you know, it's something we should consider and talk more about. We can talk with, we can 
calendar this for an officer's meeting if, President So and Vice President Moore are okay with that and talk 
through logistics with Jonas and others. 
Commissioner Williams: 
I appreciate that. Thank you.  
President So: 
Yeah, we will have a meeting in the officers meeting to discuss this. There's-  
Commissioner Williams: 
Thank you.  
President So: 
We respect that a lot. And also respect our governance. And we just need to make sure that everything is done 
accordingly. But thank you for reading the letter. We all receive it. Thank you. 
Commissioner Imperial: 
I just like to chime in my support for the letter to also do it in public as it has been done before. I understand 
that there will be some logistic issues with it that the Planning Department needs to, you know, to plan as well. 
And that's why I think the letter is requesting for, in a way, partnership with the community. As what it would 
mean because it's dated or calendared for November. I guess that will take a factor as well. So, I wish the in --
during the officer's meeting that, you know that that also be considered as well. And also, really also reaching 
out to the community as well as for support. Thank you. 
President So: 
Will do.  
Commissioner Moore: 
You may have all seen Supervisor Preston’s newsletter announcing that Governor Newsom has announced 
plans for 100% affordable housing on the DMV site. It will be a new DMV building. However, repurposing a very 
large what currently is a parking lot, not always fully occupied for 375 affordable units. This is very, very good 
news. We're starting to see results and I'm delighted to say what probably everybody else has already have seen. 
The second question I have, and that is directed towards Zoning Administrator Teague. We received a letter 
from Mister Vallejo, Vladimir Vallejo, regarding notification about 311 sites beginning 10 9 to 11 7 24. Would 
you be able to comment of what this particular notification means? And are we now from now on, being 
informed ahead of time? There are five projects on there, and I'm glad to see that we're being notified. However, 
I would like to have you perhaps comment on the change in procedures notifying us ahead of time.   
Corey Teague, Zoning Administrator: 
All right. Good afternoon, President So, Commissioners, I might need a little bit more information to completely 
understand the question. Were you saying you received a letter, a letter saying that there are projects that did 
or did not receive notification and you're asking for updates on what our notification procedures are?

Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
Corey, let me jump in here real quick. Commissioner Moore, I believe that was sent to you as well as to me by 
mistake. I think that was directed towards other staff members. And for some reason, you got captured in it and 
I got captured in it. I'm not sure we were notified of why we would have been notified of that. It's not normal 
course of procedure. 
Commissioner Moore: 
It would make sense for us because we are all obviously interested in a more extended conversation about 
protecting housing from demolition. Sorry, I'm saying something here, which was only by accident copied to 
me.  
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
These aren't all [inaudible]. They're not all demo. I mean, these are just 311 notifications, which we do – 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
Flats send out.  
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
You know, we do 311 notifications all the time. I mean, if you want notification of all 311 notifications, we can 
certainly add you to that list. But we haven't typically again, I think as Secretary Ionin said, this went out in error. 
But we issued 311 notices all the time.  
Commissioner Moore: 
If it hasn’t been sent out in error at least allows me to say that I would be interested. I think it's a healthy thing 
to expect certain notices and ahead of time. And so indeed, I would like to be copied and perhaps others do too. 
Thank you. Sorry Mr. Teague. 
Commissioner Williams: 
I would also like to be copied on that. I am very interested in, in demolition of, of existing housing. And so, the 
more the more the more the more--  
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
I just want to clarify, these aren't demos.  
Commissioner Williams: 
Oh, they’re not demos. 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
They're just 311 notices. So, someone could be expanding in their rear yard -- 
Commissioner Williams: 
Oh okay, my bad. 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
-- and require a 311 notice or a horizontal addition in a neighborhood, which, I mean, these are kind of normal, 
normal kind of expansions -- 
Commissioner Williams: 
Gotcha. 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
-- that require 311 us. Again, we're happy to put you on the list to get all 311 notifications. If you want to drill 
down and get demo notifications, we can do that as well.

Commissioner Williams: 
Actually, I think that would be helpful --  
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Sure. 
Commissioner Williams: 
-- just because we have more time to look into, you know, each project and, and kind of, you know, find out, do 
our due diligence. As we've seen before during commission meetings, information comes up from the public. 
And the more time that we have as Commissioners, we can do our job and try to you know, make sure that that 
these projects are on the up and up and that tenants are protected, people are protected. We understand 
exactly all the ramifications and the reality of what's happening.  
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
Commissioner Williams, just to be clear, not all of these projects would come before the Planning Commission. 
Commissioner Williams: 
Oh. 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
These are principally permitted projects that are just subject to neighborhood notification. They would come to 
you in the form of a DR if they do get appealed to you.  
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
But all the demos--  
Commissioner Williams: 
So, the demolition-- 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
But all the demos, all the demos would come to you.  
Commissioner Williams: 
Right. 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
If you want advance notification -- 
Commissioner Williams: 
Yes. 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
-- before they're actually before you, 
Commissioner Williams: 
Yes, yes. I think that would be helpful. Yes, I would. 
Commissioner Moore: 
My own interest in tracking if we are with all these 311 notifications, adding additional units, because if there is 
indeed a sub stream of getting more units, this would be a perfect way for you to let us know of what is 
happening, specifically by address. We know what comes in front of us are mostly enlargements where we have 
a difficult time exactly judging of how to opine on it. But as we are seeing a robust increase in density in those 
in those 311 applications, that is what I would be interested in and also hearing.
