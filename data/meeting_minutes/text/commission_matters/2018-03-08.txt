Commission Comments/Questions 
 
 
Commissioner Richards: 
Interestingly enough in this morning's Chronicle in the business section, page one, the 
headline caught me, “Connecting Citizens with City Hall” and I thought wow, let me read 
this article. It sounds kind of neat and it was about this company called Accela. I believe it 
is the Accela that we actually contracted with for online building permitting and planning 
and there's 2,000 municipalities now using Accela and now doing an off the shelf version 
so I can't wait for April 12 to get an update on how the Accela project is going here with us.
