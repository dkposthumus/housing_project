Commission Comments/Questions 
 
Commissioner Moore:    
It is with great sadness, that I’d like to ask that we close today's meeting in memory of 
Mary Gallagher, who unexpectedly passed away on July 31st and it is with great sadness 
that not only myself, as a Commissioner, but hearing from the community, we are all in 
disbelief about this untimely and early passing. Mary was the passionate voice for 
principled and good planning and she will be missed by all. I ask that we keep her in our 
memory.   
 
President Hillis:    
Thank you, Commissioner Moore, we will do that.   
 
Commissioner Moore:    
I have a few additional items I’d like to mention. One is a very interesting article which 
came through on Public Press, “Cities Seeking the Taxman on Vacant ‘Ghost Homes.” The 
City is considering levying taxes for unoccupied units as well as unoccupied retail spaces. 
It's a long article. I’d be happy to pass it around so that you guys – it is a URL. It is very 
worth reading article, particularly as it also reflects on techniques other cities are using. So 
we are not alone with this problem, but it is national, and actually also known
