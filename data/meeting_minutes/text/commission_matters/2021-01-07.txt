Commission Comments/Questions 
 
 
Commissioner Tanner: 
Well, I will just wish everybody a Happy New Year and hopefully our new year will be better 
than 2020. We are all looking forward to 2021 being-- starting out - kind of the same as 2020 
ended, but hopefully ramping up to something even better. So, it is good to see you all again 
and thank you, and for members of the public for joining us as well.
