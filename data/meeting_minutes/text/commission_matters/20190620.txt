President Melgar: 
Okay. So, I would just like to comment on the hearing that we just had and respectfully 
request that the Department come back with the work that you started a couple years ago 
and improve upon it, because I think that you know, part of what is going on is that Ms. 
Schuttish has been coming up, every week, begging us to look at the demo calcs and we've 
been waiting for this legislation and we haven't taken the appropriate action. I think we 
need to do what is right. And so, I'm hoping that, you know, we can support staff in doing 
that.
