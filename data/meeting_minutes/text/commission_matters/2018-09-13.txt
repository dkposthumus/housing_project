Commission Comments/Questions 
 
Commissioner Richards:    
I have just one quick one. Since we have three items today on our calendar revolving, what 
I consider around Historic Preservation, and I know I didn’t give the Director a heads up on 
this, I would love to understand maybe next week, a status on where the Preservation 
Element is, whether would be able to get it done this year, etc.  I would really appreciate 
that. Thanks.
