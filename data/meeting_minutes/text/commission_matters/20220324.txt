Commission Comments/Questions 
 
 
Commissioner Moore: 
I'd like to ask that we close in memory of Commissioner Kathleen Dooley tonight. She 
unexpectedly passed away. She was a Commissioner on the Small Business Commission, 
and for years and years, also one incredible voice of small businesses working with this 
Commission in past years on a number of pieces of legislation, including formula retail as it 
affects small businesses. I ask that we close in her memory tonight.

President Tanner: 
Thank you for that. That's indeed a great idea. We're certainly sorry for the loss of her life 
and to her family and friends. Any other comments from Commissioners? Certainly good to 
be back with you all in person. My first in-person hearing with you all, so, really great to see 
your faces. And to those members of the public who are here in-person, good to see you as 
well. To those who are at home on-line, we are also excited to have you. So, we might have 
a few bumps as we make our way through our first hybrid hearing, but, I think, all in all, 
hopefully it works well for everybody here. And please, rest assured if you are calling in, if 
you are writing in, we take your comments just as seriously as if you were here. So, we are 
excited to see – hopefully continue the same public engagement with the different variety 
of options for people to participate. And thank you all for your patience who are working 
with us. And thank you Mr. Secretary for all your work on this new phase of the pandemic. 
We appreciate your staff and your work.
