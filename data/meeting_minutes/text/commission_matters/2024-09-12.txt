10. LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 
Commissioner Braun: 
The Planning Commission acknowledges that we are on the unceded ancestral homeland of the Ramaytush 
Ohlone, who are the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula. As the indigenous stewards of this land 
and in accordance with their traditions, the Ramaytush Ohlone have never ceded, lost, nor forgotten their 
responsibilities as the caretakers of this place, as well as for all peoples who reside in their traditional territory. 
As guests, we recognize that we benefit from living and working on their traditional homeland. We wish to pay 
our respects by acknowledging the ancestors, elders, and relatives of the Ramaytush Ohlone community and 
by affirming their sovereign rights as first peoples.

12. COMMISSION COMMENTS/QUESTIONS 
Vice President Moore: 
I would like to take this opportunity to say hello. Welcome back from a wonderful summer break, and I want to 
welcome a full commission, particularly our new commissioner, Commissioner Campbell, and our other 
commissioner who we have only met briefly, Mr. McGarry. I am glad to see a full commission and we are ready 
to roll up our sleeves and positively enter into the challenges that are ahead of us. Wonderful things are 
happening. The city looks active, the city looks beautiful. Tourists everywhere doing the kinds of things that a 
well managed, good looking city does and I can only say it was wonderful to come home and see that there are 
so many changes that have occurred during those five weeks that we were all away. I want to just expand,
