Commission Comments/Questions 
 
Commissioner Richards:  
Now the governor signed SB330 yesterday. I know staff has been kind of holding back 
waiting until it's signed to really understand the exact implications of SB330. I’ve got three 
major concerns that I would like staff to understand. First is, do we have the resources to do 
what's needed in the timelines provided. Two, the limit on the number of public hearings, 
what's the impact. Especially around discretionary equity where we have continued projects 
in order to have the community come up with a benefits package or come to an agreement 
with the developer. And on three, a historic resource evaluation within 30 days. Do we have 
the capacity to do that? I'm really worried that all these things are going to be imposed on 
us and we are not going to be able to react with the staff we have. And then, things are just 
going to sift through and get approved. So, I would really like to see different types of 
hearings. Maybe do a pro forma on ones we have had in the past. Especially when we had 
Prop K shadows, we had Rec and Park have to weigh in, etc. And buttonhole those and see 
how they actually fit with what the legislation wants that was passed and then we could at 
least all understand that. Thank you.
