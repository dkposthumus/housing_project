Commission Comments/Questions 
 
Commissioner Richards: 
Just one quick one, I know last week I asked AnMarie Rogers to do a kind of what-if on SB-
827 and how it applies to San Francisco, but after looking at some of the comments on 
social media, I think understanding SB-827 in the context of Housing Accountability Act 
and other things really is -- really gets to the matter because it may be in and of itself SB-
827 does one thing, but when you combine it with all these other bills that hem the City in, 
it could be a whole different day after, if it does pass; if you could do that in your analysis. 
 
AnMarie Rogers, Director of Citywide Planning: 
We are nearly complete with a memo that does talk about not only 827 but also the kind of 
cascading effects that would happen in combination with the State Density Bonus. So that 
is the draft memo that we have. We could add probably a housing accountability 
paragraph and get that to you by next week's packet.
