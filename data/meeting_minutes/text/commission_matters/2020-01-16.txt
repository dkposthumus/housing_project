Commission Comments/Questions 
 
President Melgar: 
Commissioners, it’s been in the paper that I am going to be resigning from this commission. 
And I just wanted to say – I’m also no longer going to be President, but I wanted to thank 
each and every one of you for the time that I have spent here, for your support and also for 
the great discussion that we have had about the issues that pertain to our city and our built 
environment. I have learned something really valuable from each and every one of you. I 
consider you friends, as well as colleagues. Also, to the staff, I think we have amazing staff 
and particularly Jonas and Director Rahaim. I am very fond of you both and appreciate your 
professionalism and the care that you bring to this work. I have been so honored to be here 
and look forward to seeing where this Commission goes.   
 
Commissioner Moore: 
President Melgar, good onward journey. It was quite a shock when you called me because I 
hadn't read the paper, but the challenges and the road to success is always ahead of us. I 
wish you the best. We will miss you, but we will always remain colleagues anyway. Thank 
you for everything.   
 
Commissioner Johnson:   
I first just want to thank you for your leadership as President of the Planning Commission. I 
think your passion, nerdiness, your desire to really work with all of the stakeholders in the 
City and to work together for the betterment of our city and looking at the big picture has 
both set an example and really helped bolster this Commission. And so, I feel really grateful 
for that leadership and I feel very excited for the City that, you know, about your next steps, 
and that your leadership will continue to light the way and set the tone for how business 
should be done here.
