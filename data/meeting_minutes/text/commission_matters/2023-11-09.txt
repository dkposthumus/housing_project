LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 
Commissioner Braun:
The Planning Commission acknowledges that we are on the unceded ancestral homeland of the Ramaytush 
Ohlone, who are the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula. As the indigenous stewards of this land 
and in accordance with their traditions, the Ramaytush Ohlone have never ceded, lost, nor forgotten their 
responsibilities as the caretakers of this place, as well as for all peoples who reside in their traditional territory. As 
guests, we recognize that we benefit from living and working on their traditional homeland. We wish to pay our 
respects by acknowledging the ancestors, elders, and relatives of the Ramaytush Ohlone community and by 
affirming their sovereign rights as first peoples.

COMMISSION COMMENTS/QUESTIONS 
Commissioner Moore:
I would like to start off by saying it is a beautiful day and it is noticeable that we have many guests arriving in the
City today, next week. Unfortunately, the weather is predicted not to be so positive but I hope that we as the
citizens of this city can help make it easy. There will be inconveniences that are already noticeable. Please carry
your passport card if you live in affected neighborhoods. But overall, I think we have all the ability to be proud of
what we have and show our best side. I hope we will get through this peacefully and successfully and I look forward 
to welcoming the many dignitaries who will be visiting us. Thank you.
