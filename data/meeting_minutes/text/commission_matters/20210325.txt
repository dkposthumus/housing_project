Commission Comments/Questions 
 
 
 
Commissioner Tanner: 
I just wanted to note that the Department had a couple of meetings and events over the 
last two weeks related to the General Plan update and Housing Element, Transportation, I 
believe Safety and Environmental Justice. And so I was happy to be able to participate in 
two events. Thank you staff for really putting on what were really fun events for those who 
participated. Hopefully it was fun for the members of the public as it was for the panelists. 
I’m just curious, Director Hillis, if you have any updates on how the other events went or 
what might be next for those General Plan updates. I think there were a couple of surveys 
and just other activities that you were able to launch and just curious how those went off. 
 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Yeah, one, thank you for that comments, and thank you to staff for putting those together. 
It was a big undertaking but we did have good attendance and good feedback. It’s not 
replacing the outreach we’re doing for the various elements but it was good to have kind 
of them all together and to explain kind of what the General Plan does and how it affects 
our policy decisions and the City's policy decisions. So, good feedback, we’re going to

come talk to you in April about the Housing Element itself and the goals, policies and 
actions that are kind of the draft of those and get your comment and additional public 
feedback. So again, part of a much larger process, a public process, but well attended and 
good feedback. Thank you for your participation.
