Commission Comments/Questions 
 
 
 
President Tanner: 
I want to pause at this moment to do our land acknowledgment before we hear from the 
rest of you on items that may be on your mind. 
 
“The Planning Commission acknowledges that we are on the unceded ancestral homeland 
of the Ramaytush Ohlone, who are the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula. 
As the indigenous stewards of this land and in accordance with their traditions, the 
Ramaytush Ohlone have never ceded, lost, nor forgotten their responsibilities as the 
caretakers of this place, as well as for all peoples who reside in their traditional territory. As 
guests, we recognize that we benefit from living and working on their traditional homeland. 
We wish to pay our respects by acknowledging the Ancestors, Elders, and Relatives of the 
Ramaytush Ohlone community and by affirming their sovereign rights as First Peoples.” 
 
I just want to thank you for taking the time to do that with me today.  And also on an 
unrelated Planning note, congratulations to the Warriors on their recent win. So, very 
exciting stuff.
