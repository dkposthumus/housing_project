Commission Comments/Questions 
 
 
Commissioner Moore: 
I would like to ask that we acknowledge the difficulty of people calling in and not being 
quite familiar with some of our terminology i.e: the word Continuances. I got the feeling 
from reading a lot of emails coming in that the 1222 Funston Street project seems to be of 
concern to quite a few people but I am not certain that your explanation about it being 
continued for next week and should be taken off Consent next week would not even be 
heard. If thereâ€™s any way of helping people to really understand the subtleties a little better 
I think we would be doing many people and the public a great favor.
