Commission Comments/Questions 
 
Commissioner Moore: 
I have a question for the Director. You discussed with us the other week Central SoMa and 
what projects are being considered for passing under the limitations of the annual limited 
budget. The one project, which we did not mention is, indeed, 5M, which is two office 
buildings. Since that lawsuit was settled, or overturned actually, wouldn't that become 
automatically a project that would be considered?  
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
Commissioner, you approved that project. That project already has its Prop M allocations.   
 
Commissioner Moore: 
It has? Oh, it has. Okay good to know. I was concerned that in the legal battles it disappeared 
in 2015 and hadn't heard much about it.  So, I’m glad to hear that. 
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
It’s been three years since you approved it, but yes.   
 
Commissioner Moore: 
Great, thank you so much.
