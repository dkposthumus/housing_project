Commission Comments/Questions 
 
President Melgar:    
So, I just had a question for staff and that was about the organizing that neighbors are doing 
to get a Green Benefits District around Dolores Park in it's fairly large and encompasses 
Valencia Street up to Market Street. And so, while I realize it's not a commission issue I do 
think it has some land use implications. So, I think it would be great if we could have an 
informational and have some discussion about it. Thank you.
