Commission Comments/Questions 
 
Commissioner Moore: 
I was reading the paper this morning, and something struck me as a very, very bright idea. I 
am not sure if it's possible but somebody asked as to whether or not, with schools closing 
again in the uptick of the coronavirus, as to whether or not parklets could not be adapted to 
also being informal classrooms for smaller class of students. I thought it was a great idea. I 
would like to hear from somebody in Planning -- not today, perhaps but at some point, in 
the future as to whether or not that is even a feasible idea.   
 
Commissioner Tanner: 
Thank you, Commissioners, for the warm welcome and to staff for the welcome to the 
Commission. I was able to meet with leadership at the Planning Department this last week
