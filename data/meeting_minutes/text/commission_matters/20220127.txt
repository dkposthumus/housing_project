Commission Comments/Questions 
 
 
President Tanner: 
Not seeing any hands, I'll just take an opportunity to thank my fellow Commissioners for 
supporting myself and Commissioner Moore into our roles this year. I look forward to a really 
good 2022, no matter what it may bring us. Hopefully, bringing us together, in person soon. 
I'm just really looking forward to shepherding this team, and if you ever need anything, 
please do reach out to me and that goes for staff as well. I want to be as accessible as I can.
