Commission Comments/Questions 
 
 
Commissioner Tanner: 
My only comment is I'm happy to see things re-opening in San Francisco. It's coincided 
with a very strong heat wave so maybe even more cause to get outside. And just hope 
everyone is enjoying a little bit of more fun and hopefully a fun summer to come.
