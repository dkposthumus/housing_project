Commission Comments/Questions 
 
 
President Koppel: 
So, let me take a moment now to talk to the members of the public. Due to this very 
serious unexpected epidemic we’re facing, we’re really trying to balance the functioning 
government process that we have in regard to everybody’s wellbeing and life safety. This is 
something we have never had to deal with before. Again, I want to personally thank 
Director Hillis, Jonas and Christine specifically, along with all of the staff for making this 
hearing possible. I am proud to be here with you all today. We all are definitely out of our 
comfort zone, but we need to keep moving forward. The continuance calendar is definitely 
backing up. We are going to be asking for your patience today during the hearing and for 
future hearings. We’re doing this the best we can, and I am highly confident we will keep 
moving forward without compromising the public’s accessibility to comment. Up through 
today, we have been definitely reviewing all the emails that have been submitted to us 
and those who do not have internet service, there is a call-in phone number. Again, please 
be patient with us through that process. In totality, there may be a 30-second delay
