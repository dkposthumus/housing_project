11. LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 
President Tanner: 
The Planning Commission acknowledges that we are on the unceded ancestral homeland of the Ramaytush 
Ohlone, who are the original inhabitants of the San Francisco peninsula. As the indigenous stewards of this land 
and in accordance with their traditions, the Ramaytush Ohlone have never ceded, lost, nor forgotten their 
responsibilities as the caretakers of this place, as well as for all peoples who reside in their traditional territory. As 
guests, we recognize that we benefit from living and working on their traditional homeland. We wish to pay our 
respects by acknowledging the ancestors, elders, and relatives of the Ramaytush Ohlone community and by 
affirming their sovereign rights as first peoples.

13. COMMISSION COMMENTS/QUESTIONS 
Commissioner Moore:
This morning and actually in some other minor newspaper yesterday, I read something about a new form of
housing called Pods. And I'm not sure if you all have read about it, it sounds kind of like fun, but I'm not quite sure 
if it fits of what we all have in mind, so I direct my question to Director Hillis as to whether or not you will update us 
or have any forecast of what this may be. 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
What we, I saw that as well. We've got an enforcement case open because as you suspected, it does not meet the 
code requirements, but you know,-- 
Commissioner Moore:
Who knows. 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
We'll, we can follow up and give you an update on what happens. 
Commissioner Moore:
I thought it would be kind of like a youth hostel perhaps or something to that extent. 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
We'll let you know. We can give you more details on that. 
Commissioner Moore:
Okay, that would be great. Thanks.
