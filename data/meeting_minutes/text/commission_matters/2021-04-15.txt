Commission Comments/Questions 
 
 
Commissioner Tanner: 
Thank you. I just wanted to note, last week on the 8th, even though we weren't meeting, 
there was a virtual ribbon cutting for a streetscape pilot project out in the Excelsior. And I 
was able to attend via Zoom or I guess it was YouTube, I think, I was watching the ribbon 
cutting on. So, I just wanted to commend the staff who worked hard on that, as well as the 
youth from the Youth Art Exchange. It's a really fabulous program they have, if you’re not 
familiar with it, where they really train children and young people to use their artistic talents 
and to put them to work to making great street furniture and other things. So it’s a really 
wonderful melding of the arts with career building and then having something that is 
tangible out in the community. So, such a great opportunity. And another great example - 
their facility was able to take over a vacant storefront out in the Excelsior neighborhood. So
