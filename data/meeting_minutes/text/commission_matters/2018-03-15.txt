Commission Comments/Questions 
 
Commissioner Richards: 
Couple of things, I don't know if anybody saw in last Sunday’s Examiner the Grand Jury 
Report. They do them, I guess, once a year in the Spring. I looked at it, I read it, and I was 
like oh, it's kind of nice, you know, how does this affect anything in the Planning 
Department, and I came upon number seven and it talks about accelerating San Francisco 
government performance and taking accountability and transparency to the next level, 
and lo and behold, in our packet this week we had a memo from Mr. DiSanto on our 
technology update. I read it and I said “Wow, I think we're actually being as transparent as 
we possibly can.” When you look at everything that you can see online, I think, we’ll have 
to tie these two together, but I think we're making really good strides to being transparent
