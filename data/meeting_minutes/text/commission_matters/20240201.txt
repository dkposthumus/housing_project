7. LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 
Commissioner Imperial: 
The Planning Commission acknowledges that we are on the unceded ancestral homeland of the Ramaytush 
Ohlone, who are the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula. As the indigenous stewards of this land 
and in accordance with their traditions, the Ramaytush Ohlone have never ceded, lost, nor forgotten their 
responsibilities as the caretakers of this place, as well as for all peoples who reside in their traditional territory. As 
guests, we recognize that we benefit from living and working on their traditional homeland. We wish to pay our 
respects by acknowledging the ancestors, elders, and relatives of the Ramaytush Ohlone community and by 
affirming their sovereign rights as first peoples.

9. COMMISSION COMMENTS/QUESTIONS 
Commissioner Ruiz: 
Thank you. Yeah, I wanted to address something that I've had many conversations with community members 
about, and it's regarding the recent state budget cuts to affordable housing. In January, I understand the 
governor delivered his statewide budget, which included more than $1.2 billion in cuts to affordable housing 
programs. And I think this is incredibly significant and cannot be ignored, especially amidst all of our 
conversations around the housing element and being in compliance. And our recent RHNA allocation, our 
affordable housing mandates increased by 285 percent going from nearly 17,000 affordable housing units to 
now almost 47,000. And I know we have fallen short in our previous affordable housing goals, and I don't think 
we most definitely will not reach them if we don't have support coming from the state. So I would like to suggest 
that the Planning Commission introduce a resolution urging the governor and state legislators to reject the 
proposed state budget cuts to affordable housing and support us with the resources that we're going to need to 
fulfill these mandates. 
 
Commissioner Imperial: 
Yeah, thank you, Commissioner Ruiz, for bringing that up. I think its, I will be supportive for the Commission to 
write a resolution. Of course, in terms, and that's something I would ask President Diamond if that's something 
we could agendized in whatever date possible for us to create a resolution and be voted on it.

President Diamond: 
So I am generally supportive of this idea. We absolutely need the funding in order to meet the mandate. But I 
want to do it in a manner that's likely to be most effective. And therefore I turn to you, Director Hillis, to see if 
there's a way we can do it that is collaborative with whatever other efforts are being undertaken by the city to 
intercede with the state to ensure that we receive affordable funding, housing. 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Sure. And absolutely we're happy to work with you all to get something on calendar. I think the timing works 
well because the Affordable Housing Leadership Committee, which we established that was kind of called for 
during the housing element, is wrapping up its work. So we expect to get their recommendations soon, in the, 
you know, later this month. And we can calendar that when their, you know, their primary charge was to look at 
funding and how to meet our obligations. And obviously, one of the biggest hurdles to that is funding at local, 
state and national level. So you will see recommendations. So I think we can marry those two and have that 
hearing which we were scheduling for later this month in February and combine it with the request you have 
Commissioner Ruiz take an action or endorse a resolution related to that hearing. If related to that hearing, if we 
want to. But I think that works. The timing works well.  
 
President Diamond: 
So, Commissioner Ruiz, does that make sense to you to, maybe I could ask you to work with Director Hillis on the 
drafting of the resolution. And also working out the appropriate timing, because it does seem like having this 
information presented to us would be an important first step before adopting the resolution.  
 
Commissioner Ruiz:  
I think that sounds right to me.  
 
President Diamond: 
That's true. 
 
Commissioner Moore: 
I would actually appreciate if we would have it agendized just to vet the issue. I mean, I would think it would be 
informative to Commissioner Ruiz to also hear other Commissioners’ thoughts, pro or con or in between, in 
addition to having the public comment in whatever form is appropriate as we deliberate, I believe that we are 
also looking for public comment. So the budget cuts from Sacramento are coming really like a thunderstorm 
with the extent or the numbers being so significantly high that they almost invalidate of what we are doing here. 
We're trying to push from both ends without moving anything. And for that reason, I think I would appreciate 
having a forum to hear each other clearly because we're going to be penalized one way or the other. But if the 
state, who has in the past not helped in any significant way, I would appreciate having that out here and have 
each of us independently voice our questions and our concerns.  
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
I think yeah, I'm I'm fine with that. Like you all control the agenda, but I'm happy to support that effort and make 
sure that is agendized. But I think having the context of the report, which actually was done to look at funding 
options, I think is just good to have that but having the resolution separately too. 
 
Commissioner Moore: 
I totally agree with you as a stepping stone, in the end, we need to work together and I think all of us are in 
support of your effort. But I think for us to take an independent look at it would help.  
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Sure.  
 
Commissioner Moore: 
Is that would that what you have been thinking of?

Commissioner Ruiz: 
So, if I'm understanding correctly, agendize a resolution before -- 
 
Commissioner Moore: 
Agendize the discussion.  
 
Commissioner Ruiz: 
Agendize a discussion. Yeah.  
 
Commissioner Moore: 
So that we have common ground on the points that you are trying to elevate. 
 
Commissioner Ruiz: 
That sounds fine to me.  
 
Commissioner Braun: 
I'm definitely supportive of the idea of authoring a resolution that would oppose any cuts to affordable housing, 
support or funding from the state. But also, I agree with President Diamond's perspective that we should make 
sure we're going to do this in a really effective way and with the knowledge that we need to craft the wording 
properly. I look forward to having a deeper conversation about this. If we do have a discussion about the issue 
prior to the formal, you know, action on a on a resolution, at the very least, I would appreciate more context 
coming forward for that. I don't want to create a huge burden for staff to prepare a whole lot of information, 
necessarily. But still, if there are budget cuts at the state level for affordable housing funding, I'd like to at least 
have the context of what programs are being cut and what kinds of dollar amounts are being considered. And 
whatever information is possible to bring forward to help us with our discussion would be helpful.  
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Yeah. And these recommendations come with extensive background documents and research that we've done 
and where we've been. I don't think we lose any time like we do. I think the timing works. We're ready, you know, 
in the next couple of weeks to come to you with that report and have that discussion on, and you know, can take 
on the resolution as well. You're welcome to do it prior, if you want. I just think having that document, which you 
know, has been, been we've been working with the affordable housing community, MOHCD has been very much 
involved in, it shows options would be helpful, but ultimately your choice.  
 
President Diamond: 
So my strong preference is to actually have that document, and agendize our discussion after we've had a chance 
to review that document, I feel like I'll have way more information in order to express my views. I think we'd all 
benefit by having the background document. And if it's just, you know…  
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
I think it's three weeks.  
 
President Diamond: 
Three weeks, I suggest that we have that document presented to us and we agendize our discussion and 
potential resolution for the week afterwards or even that week, the same day… 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
At the same day. Yeah, right.  
 
President Diamond: 
-- the same day, if you want, because we'll have received it in the staff report. Right. So we'll have had a chance 
to review it ahead of time.

Commissioner Imperial: 
I have a question, President Diamond. In terms of, what you just mentioned. So, on the day of this Affordable 
Housing Council going to report on us and that is also the day that we can discuss the language of the resolution. 
Of course, there's a lot of and perhaps that day will not be the day for us to vote on the resolution. That's what 
you're saying.  
 
President Diamond: 
Uh-hum. 
 
Commissioner Imperial: 
So, it will have to be agendized for the next week perhaps to vote on the resolution.  
 
President Diamond: 
Well, it really, that's a matter of discussion, I think, between Director Hillis and Commissioner Ruiz. If you think 
you can have the data available to you sufficiently in advance that you could come up with the draft resolution 
and circulate it in the same staff package we get the Friday before the hearing, which would be the same time 
we'd be getting the report from the committee. I think we could consider them together if we feel like based 
upon the report, that additional modifications are necessary, we can consider them at the hearing or continue it. 
But I'd be fine scheduling them both for the same day. But really, that's Director Hills and Commissioner Ruiz. Do 
you feel like you have time between now and then to draft the resolution?     
 
Commissioner Ruiz: 
Yeah, I think now between the end of February, we can draft the resolution, agendize both items together, 
discuss and vote that hearing.  
 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
I think it would fit nicely Commissioners on February 22nd; you already have the Expanding Housing Choice 
Informational Presentation coming forward. We could make it an a and b item where this item could be a 
potential action item.   
 
President Diamond: 
Okay. Do we need to actually vote on?  
 
Jonas P. Ionin: 
No. 
 
President Diamond: 
I didn't think so. Okay, all right.
