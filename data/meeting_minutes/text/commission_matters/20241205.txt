LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 
Commissioner Imperial: 
The Planning Commission acknowledges that we are on the unceded ancestral homeland of the Ramaytush 
Ohlone, who are the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula. As the indigenous stewards of this land 
and in accordance with their traditions, the Ramaytush Ohlone have never ceded, lost, nor forgotten their 
responsibilities as the caretakers of this place, as well as for all peoples who reside in their traditional territory. 
As guests, we recognize that we benefit from living and working on their traditional homeland. We wish to pay 
our respects by acknowledging the ancestors, elders, and relatives of the Ramaytush Ohlone community and 
by affirming their sovereign rights as first peoples.

COMMISSION COMMENTS/QUESTIONS 
Commissioner Campbell: 
Thank you. I want to shine a light, no pun intended, on Let's Glow SF which is happening right now downtown. 
It's a wonderful free art festival. It's actually a projection art festival where 16 artists from around the world who 
have created light and projection art. It gets projected onto the buildings downtown, various buildings 
downtown, and it's a really wonderful intersection between art and architecture. I encourage everyone to go 
check it out again. It's free. It runs from December 6th to the 15th, so it starts tomorrow night. And I think there's 
a big kickoff party at the Ferry Building. So, if you want more information, Let's Glow SF has a website, just 
google it and you can get the map and all the buildings that are part of the festival. Thanks.  
Commissioner Braun: 
I just want to agree that it's a wonderful event. I go and look at all of the projections every year that it's been 
running. So, absolutely. It's wonderful.
