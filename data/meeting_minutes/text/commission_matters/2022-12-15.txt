Land Acknowledgement 
 
 
President Tanner: 
The Planning Commission acknowledges that we are on the unceded ancestral homeland 
of the Ramaytush Ohlone, who are the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula. 
As the indigenous stewards of this land and in accordance with their traditions, the 
Ramaytush Ohlone have never ceded, lost, nor forgotten their responsibilities as the 
caretakers of this place, as well as for all peoples who reside in their traditional territory. As 
guests, we recognize that we benefit from living and working on their traditional 
homeland. We wish to pay our respects by acknowledging the Ancestors, Elders, and 
Relatives of the Ramaytush Ohlone community and by affirming their sovereign rights as 
First Peoples.

Commission Comments/Questions 
 
 
 
President Tanner: 
I only will say today is our last hearing of 2022 if we can believe that it is already time to 
start 2023. I just want to thank all the staff who helped make these Commission hearings 
happen and go smoothly. The public that comes in and the staff that don’t always see but I 
know who are working hard at the Department and contributing to the projects that we 
see. And we got to have a holiday party last week, it was great to see some staff in person
