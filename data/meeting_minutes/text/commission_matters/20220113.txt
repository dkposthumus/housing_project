Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
I will simply note to you all and members of the public that the Election of Officers is 
scheduled to be held at your next hearing on January 20th. At that hearing you can 
nominate new officers or continue that matter to a later date. 
 
 
 
Commissioner Moore: 
I had one question. I kind of didn't press my button in time. I heard about AB 854. Again, 
there are many, many things being discussed in Sacramento and this particular item deals 
with evictions and I'm wondering if staff has any insight into what's being tried to be 
accomplished by this particular legislation? AB 854. I would appreciate it if somebody 
could give us an insight once you have it. Thank you.
