Commission Comments/Questions 
 
 
 
Commissioner Tanner: 
Good afternoon Commissioners. Just want to remind everyone that it is still Black History 
Month for about a week and a half longer. Hard to believe we’re most of the way through 
February already, but just want to encourage folks even though you have to maybe shelter 
in place or not get out as much, there are great number of online events and also a lot of 
great films on streaming if you want to celebrate Black History Month in that way. So, 
happy Black History Month everyone. 
 
 
 
 
 
Commissioner Fung: 
I have a request for the Director. Recent news has brought forth, a couple of programs are 
being discussed related to the elimination of Exclusionary Zoning, specifically in Berkeley 
and Sacramento. And I think perhaps it would also be interesting to see what Portland is 
doing since they are a larger urban setting. Would it be possible for staff to provide an 
analysis and summary of what is being proposed there in those programs to the 
Commission? 
 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Absolutely Commissioner. We will do that. We’re going to be before you too in – I believe 
in March to talk about our Housing Element Work which this will certainly be a topic of
