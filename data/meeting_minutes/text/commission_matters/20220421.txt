President Tanner: 
I don't have any comments or questions today other than just to say I miss being in the 
Chamber with you all. But, as you may have heard, I am just a little under the weather and 
don’t want to risk anything, but glad to be joining via Zoom and hope everyone is doing 
really well today.
