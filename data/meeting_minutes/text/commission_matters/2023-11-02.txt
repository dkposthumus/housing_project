The Planning Commission acknowledges that we are on the unceded ancestral homeland of the Ramaytush 
Ohlone, who are the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula. As the indigenous stewards of this land 
and in accordance with their traditions, the Ramaytush Ohlone have never ceded, lost, nor forgotten their 
responsibilities as the caretakers of this place, as well as for all peoples who reside in their traditional territory. As 
guests, we recognize that we benefit from living and working on their traditional homeland. We wish to pay our 
respects by acknowledging the ancestors, elders, and relatives of the Ramaytush Ohlone community and by 
affirming their sovereign rights as first peoples.

13. COMMISSION COMMENTS/QUESTIONS 
Commissioner Imperial: 
I just want to--I believe this weekend, we received a letter from the Committee Equity Council regarding the 
equity, I guess they named it as Equity Vision of Downtown, which I would like to applaud them and sending 
us that kind of vision for equity as we’re thinking or going through the process of downtown recovery. And I 
also, just want to highlight too because, I think two weeks ago I went to SF MOMA and that was the time that 
the first exhibition was the Filipino artist, Precita Abad. And that was my first time actually going to SF MOMA 
exhibiting a Filipino artist and that was the day that -- it was free for the community and it was a really 
elevating moment for me. I don't usually go to SF MOMA because I can't relate to the art exhibitions but I 
think the letter that the Committee Equity Council also, it elevates us to what the experience or try the vision
