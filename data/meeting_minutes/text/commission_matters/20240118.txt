5. LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 
President Tanner: 
Thank you. I want to finally do something that I said I was gonna do a year ago, which is make a schedule for the 
Land Acknowledgment to share the duty amongst those of us who want to do that. So, it just has each 
Commission hearing and then someone's name next to it. And then a slightly easier to read version of the Land 
Acknowledgment. And this folder will just be back there with our little snack and name tag cabinet. So, if you 
want to take a look at it later on, if you're not interested, you can just cross yourself out. And the only order is just 
alphabetically, I think. And goes it goes basically me to everybody and then comes back around. So, it's just 
repeating. So anyhow, there's that little housekeeping for the land acknowledgment and I'll happy to share it 
today.  
The Planning Commission acknowledges that we are on the unceded ancestral homeland of the Ramaytush 
Ohlone, who are the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula. As the indigenous stewards of this land 
and in accordance with their traditions, the Ramaytush Ohlone have never ceded, lost, nor forgotten their 
responsibilities as the caretakers of this place, as well as for all peoples who reside in their traditional territory. As 
guests, we recognize that we benefit from living and working on their traditional homeland. We wish to pay our 
respects by acknowledging the ancestors, elders, and relatives of the Ramaytush Ohlone community and by 
affirming their sovereign rights as first peoples.

6. COMMISSION COMMENTS/QUESTIONS 
 
Commissioner Moore: 
I wanted to thank everybody, the Department, the developer and everybody who organized our site visit to the 
TransAmerica Pyramid yesterday. A remarkable experience, high quality architecture, beautifully crafted spaces. 
And I think it's going to be a major improvement of what it was before. I am very thankful, and I assume my 
colleagues who were with us will share my sentiment here. 
 
President Tanner: 
Absolutely. I definitely second that and very, even with the construction fencing still around, I was very impressed 
and can't wait until it's completely done. So, definitely creating a lot of more connectivity in that area. And just 
again, great to see folks taking an investment in San Francisco and continuing to believe in the present and the 
future of the city. 
 
Commissioner Imperial: 
Yeah, I noticed in, we, as we have a conversation last hearing about the remote hearing. It's not scheduled today. 
I thought this would be the day we would have discussion on that or… 
 
President Tanner: 
Well, we could, you could request to have this discussion. I didn't hear anybody who voted to end remote 
comment saying that they would incline to change their vote so it didn’t seem that there would be a change. But 
if you, we want to discuss it again, this is the time to request future discussion items. But I don’t know that there’d 
be a different outcome.  
 
Commissioner Moore: 
I got the impression that at least 3 or 4 Commissioners voiced support to at least re-discuss it. That did not state 
a preference or not, no preference, just the ability to revisit it one more time. Particularly, I think also people were 
interested in the position that Historic Preservation took. That was really part of the reason. 
 
President Tanner: 
Okay, well, if folks want to discuss it, we can discuss it. I just will say nobody who voted no said anything. So, or 
voted to end public comment, said that they wanted to change their votes. But if folks are interested then we 
can discuss it. 
 
Commissioner Imperial: 
I guess another question on that. When is the decision for the Historic Preservation? 
 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
They made that decision yesterday, in fact, and I can give you that update now, or I can give it to you when we 
talk about the Historic Preservation Commission--- 
 
President Tanner: 
Well, we're on the topic. 
 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
Yeah, since we're on topic, the Historic Preservation Commission actually voted unanimously to cease their 
remote public comment. And, during their deliberations, I mentioned that the Planning Commission actually 
decided to afford peripheral staff or sort of advisory members of staff, technical experts, to continue to come in 
or participate via Webex or remotely. They chose actually to not afford that to staff and require that all staff 
presenters be in person before them. So, they completely ceased remote public comment. They felt it was, some 
of their comments were related around the importance of getting back to normal and social implications and 
the negative impacts of being remote not only for the workplace, but for just people in general.

President Tanner: 
Great. Thanks for the update.  
 
Commissioner Imperial: 
I guess my question is to other Commissioners who commented last week whether they're still interested for 
another discussion on this, and are there any more clarification, questions that needs to happen or-- 
 
President Tanner: 
Great question. If we if we can discuss agendizing it. And, if you have additional information you're seeking at 
that discussion, please let, you know, particularly Secretary know. So, if there's other Boards or Commissions, 
you're trying to understand other trends that, that information could be provided again or sought if it was 
unknown at the time. 
 
Commissioner Braun: 
I would just say I'm open to having the discussion again. Last time we left it at, I think it was going to be discussed 
at the Officers meeting. But if it's something that needs to be agendized, we could do that. Although I guess the 
question does remain to some extent, does it, will it matter? Has anyone actually who voted no, changed their 
position on it? And if not, maybe it's just not a good use of our time so -- 
 
Commissioner Imperial: 
I guess I can speak. On my end, if there is additional information or questions in terms of how the accommodate, 
the request for accommodation, if there are more further questions on that. And other, other circumstances that 
we see, you know, I think that will probably need to be, I guess, more discussed. 
 
President Tanner: 
Do you have questions? Is that what you're saying or you're saying other people have questions? 
 
Commissioner Imperial: 
No. If other people have questions if they want to address additional information. 
 
President Tanner: 
Yeah, okay great. do you have any further comments, Commissioner Braun? 
 
Commissioner Braun: 
No, I don’t think so. 
 
President Tanner: 
Okay great.  
 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
So, are we or are we not scheduling an agendized item for remote public comment? It didn't sound like but I just 
want to be clear because at the last hearing-- 
 
President Tanner: 
It sounds like Commissioner Imperial would like to discuss it. That's what I am hearing but -- 
 
Commissioner Moore: 
I like clarity. And since we left it somewhat ambiguous for the public, it would take five minutes for us to revisit 
the subject matter and make a clear statement one way or the other. 
 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
So, you would like to revote?

Commissioner Moore: 
Yes, I would like to schedule it again just for a brief revisit. And also, because some people may be [inaudible] 
 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
Is there consent from the rest of the Commission? 
 
Commissioner Moore: 
--right now hear the position of HPC. That’s what I would do. 
 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
Is there consent from the rest of the Commissioners? 
 
Commissioner Braun: 
I agree. 
 
President Tanner: 
Okay, we've got a couple folks. I think it's fine. 
 
Commissioner Koppel: 
I just wanted to remind everyone that people still have the ability to approach the Secretary prior to the hearing 
and gain this access. So, the avenue for them to participate remotely still exists, as we are right now. 
 
President Tanner: 
Very true. So why don't we just discuss it one more time, put it to bed, and we'll be concluded with that item. 
 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
Very good. I will add it to next week's hearing. Although, Commissioner Diamond, you're expected to be absent, 
so maybe the in two weeks. 
 
President Tanner: 
The following hearing. 
 
Commissioner Diamond: 
Could you do it in two weeks then? 
 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
Yeah.
