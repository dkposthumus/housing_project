Commission Comments/Questions 
 
President Melgar: 
I just have one thing. I am sure most of us saw the many stories that came out of the study 
in New York linking re-zoning with displacement and gentrification. A lot of articles came 
out of that looking at the methodology, looking at different aspects, but nevertheless, I 
really want us to look at that and look at our own re-zoning. Director Rahaim and I were 
honored to be part of a panel at SPUR about a month, month and a half ago. Looking back 
at the eastern neighborhoodâ€™s re-zoning and what has happened. Whether the tools that 
we thought were going to work for this and that, actually ended up doing what was 
intended. I think the jury is still out on that, but as we face the multiple initiatives from the 
state to increase density, I would encourage us to look more comprehensively and in a 
nuance way at displacement, gentrification, and also financing and the markets. Because in 
many ways, we think that we can tinker with things by zoning something like this and it will 
happen. Often times it is about the availability of capital or who has access to capital and 
who doesn't that drives change. And so, I would love it if at some point we could have that 
discussion here that we had at SPUR, about the eastern neighborhood, in light of what other 
cities have experienced when they re-zoned entire neighborhoods. And the effect on the 
population of those cities as it pertains to gentrification and displacement.
