Commissioner Moore: 
I wanted to strongly encourage everybody to participate in Mondayâ€™s invitation for a 
noontime presentation by Director William Gilchrist, Planning Director of the City of 
Oakland. He will speak on a matter that I personally found fascinating hearing his 
presentation at an earlier AIA presentation in September. It is a perfect answer to how 
cities deal with the racial and social equity and I strongly encourage you if you have time to 
dial in to that presentation.
