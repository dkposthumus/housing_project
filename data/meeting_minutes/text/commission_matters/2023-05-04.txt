Land Acknowledgement 
President Tanner:
Thank you. I have asked Commissioner Ruiz, we’re so happy to have you back, to share the
Land Acknowledgement today. And we’ll just give a moment for folks to clear out of the
chamber before you begin but yeah, it’s great to have you here.
Commissioner Ruiz:
Thanks everybody. Happy to be back.
The Planning Commission acknowledges that we are on the unceded ancestral homeland
of the Ramaytush Ohlone, who are the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula.
As the indigenous stewards of this land and in accordance with their traditions, the
Ramaytush Ohlone have never ceded, lost, nor forgotten their responsibilities as the
caretakers of this place, as well as for all peoples who reside in their traditional territory. As
guests, we recognize that we benefit from living and working on their traditional
homeland. We wish to pay our respects by acknowledging the Ancestors, Elders, and
Relatives of the Ramaytush Ohlone community and by affirming their sovereign rights as
First Peoples.
