Commission Comments/Questions 
 
President Melgar: 
So, I will start by thanking everyone in the community for being here. For this tremendous 
outpouring of interest in the planning and the future of our neighborhood. I also want to 
thank the Planning staff for the exceeding care that they have exhibited in putting 
together a plan for things to go smoothly today.  Especially Mr. Sucre and Jonas Ionin. So, I 
hope that we can have a smooth hearing where everyone can have their voices heard and 
that we can deliberate as a commission given all the information about what the 
community feels about this project today. Thank you for being here.
