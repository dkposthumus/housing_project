Commission Comments/Questions 
 
 
 
 
 
Commissioner Moore: 
I want to acknowledge the public who write to us about their concerns regarding 
immediate or pending projects. I would like to ask that when you write that you please 
write closer to the date at which your item is being heard. There is a significant amount of 
e-mails we all receive. Sometimes, things that are very important get lost in the large 
stream of other e-mails. And when it comes to the date when your project is being heard, 
one may have forgotten that an e-mail came in, perhaps three or four weeks earlier, and I, 
personally, would ask that you write to us please closer to when your item is being heard. 
Thank you.  
 
 
 
President Koppel: 
Let me also just echo Commissioner Moore's comments. We have enough to deal with on a 
weekly basis and it is a lot helpful for us if we have the official packet completed that we 
can reference while we are talking to members of the public. So, I am in full agreement 
with that, Commissioner Moore.  
 
Commissioner Moore: 
Thank you, President Koppel.
