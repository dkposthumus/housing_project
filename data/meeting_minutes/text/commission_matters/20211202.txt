Commission Comments/Questions 
 
 
 
Commissioner Tanner: 
This is totally unrelated I supposed to our course of business but I just want to welcome 
everybody back from the holidays. Good to see you all and hopefully sometime in the new 
year we will be together in person. But I also wanted to congratulate the Michigan 
Wolverines on their victory over Ohio State this past weekend. So, Go Blue. I wouldn’t be a 
good wolverine if I didn’t mention that. Hope you guys had a happy holiday.
