Commission Comments/Questions 
 
Commissioner Moore: 
Iâ€™m sure all of us have been watching the papers and there is SB50 coming up. I want to ask 
the Department and Ms. Rodgers, is not in the room, I would like to see the Department do 
an analysis update, just as it successfully did when comparing A-27 which basically looks at 
the effects of that particular bill on San Francisco. Is there support from the rest of the 
Commission? 
 
President Hillis: 
Yeah. I think that's a great idea. We will do that.
