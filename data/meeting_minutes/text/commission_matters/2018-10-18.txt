Commission Comments/Questions 
 
Commissioner Moore: 
I have one brief question. In our packet was a two pages Compliance to Land Dedication 
Eastern Neighborhoods but we’re not referencing any originator or why we’re getting it 
and I was just wondering if that was an error, or there’s any message to it that we should 
be aware of.   
 
President Hillis: 
Director Rahaim, do you know? 
 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
We can look into it.  I don’t have it in my packet.  
 
Commissioner Moore: 
It could be an error piece of paper. I will hand it to the Director.
