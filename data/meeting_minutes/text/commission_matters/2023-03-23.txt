Land Acknowledgement 
 
 
 
President Tanner: 
The Planning Commission acknowledges that we are on the unceded ancestral homeland 
of the Ramaytush Ohlone, who are the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula. 
As the indigenous stewards of this land and in accordance with their traditions, the 
Ramaytush Ohlone have never ceded, lost, nor forgotten their responsibilities as the 
caretakers of this place, as well as for all peoples who reside in their traditional territory. As 
guests, we recognize that we benefit from living and working on their traditional 
homeland. We wish to pay our respects by acknowledging the Ancestors, Elders, and 
Relatives of the Ramaytush Ohlone community and by affirming their sovereign rights as 
First Peoples.

Commission Comments/Questions 
 
 
 
Commissioner Moore: 
I would like to see that the Planning Commission and perhaps together with other citizens 
ask Park and Rec about the damage to important trees in public parks and on streets. In my 
particular neighborhood, with a very important historic park right in the middle, some 
important trees which actually framed the park as a space came down and it's just a 
heartbreak. At least that is my reaction to it. Also, along streets where we use trees to 
landmark where we are, coming up Van Ness or Polk, major large trees that have been 
there forever are all down and I would like to see some response from Park and Rec about 
what they're planning to do and how the rest of the city is doing relative to major loss of 
trees.
