President Tanner: 
The Planning Commission acknowledges that we are on the unceded ancestral homeland 
of the Ramaytush Ohlone, who are the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula. 
As the indigenous stewards of this land and in accordance with their traditions, the 
Ramaytush Ohlone have never ceded, lost, nor forgotten their responsibilities as the 
caretakers of this place, as well as for all peoples who reside in their traditional territory. As 
guests, we recognize that we benefit from living and working on their traditional 
homeland. We wish to pay our respects by acknowledging the Ancestors, Elders, and 
Relatives of the Ramaytush Ohlone community and by affirming their sovereign rights as 
First Peoples.

Commission Comments/Questions 
 
  
 
Commissioner Moore: 
Happy new year to everybody first. And secondly, it came to my attention that on Tuesday, 
the 3rd of January, the Planning Department made a presentation to the Board of Appeals 
and it included a review of State Housing Legislation including State Density Bonus, SB35, 
and AB2011 and SB330. Can the Commission get a presentation like it in the ever-changing 
world of state legislation? It would be helpful to stay on top of what's going on and allow us 
to hear the same presentation. 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Commissioner, sure. We can -- I think we have given you elements of that presentation in 
the past but happy to 1) first, we can send you the presentation that we gave to the Board 
of Appeals and if you would like the same presentation, happy to do that as well.  
 
Commissioner Moore: 
The problem for us, Director Hillis, and great to see you again even in the blue lagoon there, 
is that things are changing so rapidly that we often lose track. This is not our day-to-day 
conversation and as we have irregularly spaced discussions on it would help a lot. At least it 
would help me, speaking for myself.  
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Sure. We could do it.

President Tanner: 
I would support that Commissioner Moore. It is great to get a primer of what we can expect- 
what laws are in effect now and how things have changed. Never seems to get more simple, 
so it is good to have that.  
I would just second Commissioner Moore and just say happy new year to everyone. Thank 
you, Commissioners, for meeting online. I think in light of all of the weather that we have 
been having, it proved very prudent. So hopefully everyone is staying safe. And I just want 
to thank all of our first responders and other emergency staff who are helping our city and 
our residents through the storm and just hope that everyone can continue to be mindful, 
please use 311 for non-emergencies, use 911 for emergencies and just really don't go out 
when the weather is bad if you don't have to. This can help keep yourself safe and prevent 
our first responders from having to get out there and rescue you if you need it or deal with 
any other issues. So, hopefully everyone is staying safe, and I guess we’ll see if the drought 
is over at the end of this. And welcome back everybody.
