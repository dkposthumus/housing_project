Commission Comments/Questions 
 
Commissioner Moore: 
I read an interesting article in the APA Journal speaking about demolition versus 
deconstruction. The City of Palo Alto has joined or taken example from Portland where the 
demolition of homes is not just simply a demolition anymore, but it is a systematic 
destruction of the structure to reuse, recycle, and alleviate excessive landfill due to 
demolition. This particular piece of legislation is going into effect in Palo Alto in July 2020 
and affects commercial as wells as residential buildings. It would be a very interesting 
thing for this city to look into and also consider. There are costs associated with it, but that 
is secondary to the benefit of what this program could achieve. I will hand it around for 
people to read.    
 
President Melgar: 
Thank you, commissioner. I also wanted to say that while I was on vacation, my e-mail got 
hacked. So, if you got an e-mail from me asking you to purchase Amazon cards or 
whatever, it wasn't from me and I apologize.
