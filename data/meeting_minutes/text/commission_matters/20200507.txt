Commission Comments/Questions 
 
Commissioner Imperial: 
I just would like to thank the staff, Planning Department in coming up with a COVID-19 
physical distance public participation guide and I think overall, it's a satisfactory guide. I 
may need some -- a little bit of suggestion but thank you for doing this. Greatly 
appreciated.
