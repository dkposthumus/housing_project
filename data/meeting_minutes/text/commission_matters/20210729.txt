Commission Comments/Questions 
 
 
 
Commissioner Tanner: 
I just want to give a shout out to Operation Genesis. They are a program that helps youth in 
our city to be exposed to different career paths and this summer they partnered with a 
number of partners to provide a real estate and kind of community development 
opportunity for high school and some early college students in the Bay Area. We’ve had our 
first [inaudible] event this past week at the Planning Department’s new building and the 
wonderful rooms on the ground floor. So, thank you to Department staff for helping make 
that space available. It was really lovely, and students presented projects they had worked 
on and they were very impressive. Kind of a proposal for a faux development in the city and 
it was really inspiring to see all of the things they wanted to put into the projects. And I think 
if they got their chance to  develop more buildings, we might have a little bit mon fun in the 
City in bringing the ideas of the young people put to life. So again, thank you Department 
staff for helping make that possible. And thanks to Operation Genesis for all the organization 
that they have done. 
 
 
 
Commissioner Moore: 
I want to thank staff for sending out the invitation for the final presentation for the Young 
Planners program on August 5th. I hope that everybody is around to dial in and see what 
happened. Thank you for the program. I very much look forward to participating on the 5th.
