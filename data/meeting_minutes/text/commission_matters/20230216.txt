Commission Comments/Questions 
 
 
 
President Tanner: 
Well it seems like a routine here. We’re implementing one tragedy after another for these 
last few weeks. But I would be remiss if not just recognizing the shooting unfortunately 
that happened at Michigan State University earlier this week. And being my home state of 
Michigan and I have relatives in Lansing it just again hit pretty close to home, sadly. 
Fortunately, everyone I know is fine but just want to have a moment to recognize those 
victims and survivors. And I was thinking “maybe I shouldn’t say something because it’s so 
frequent” and I thought that’s the exact point. Because we have it happen so much in our 
country and don’t want to become numb to what’s happening and hopefully, we’ll have 
some folks at different level of government who will take some actions to help prevent 
more tragedies like this from occurring. But for now our thoughts are with those families.
