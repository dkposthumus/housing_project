Commissioner Johnson: 
I wanted to mention something that was in the news over MLK holiday, which for those of 
you who might be paying attention to what is happening across the bay. For the last

housing as a human right by occupying an abandoned house in West Oakland. There was 
an agreement reached right in time for MLK Day in which the Oakland Land Trust will be

city and the state for all of its properties to negotiate both land trusting and negotiating 
the sale to nonprofit organizations. I think as we -- during this hearing, we'll be talking 
about the next two years, or the next year of our budget and our priorities. I think just 
reaffirming that land trust and land banking is a crucial component of making sure that 
our city has affordable housing in the long run. I think Supervisor Fewer's legislation 
around helping nonprofits to purchase multifamily housing and keeping it affordable is 
great, and we must bank land and we must protect land for permanent affordable 
housing. I hope that at some point we can have a presentation on land banking and land 
trusts and different tactics that cities across the country are using so that we can begin to 
bolster that in our city as well.
