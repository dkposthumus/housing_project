Commission Comments/Questions 
 
 
Commissioner Tanner: 
Hello, everyone, just wanted to wish everyone a happy Women's History Month in March 
as it just began. So, hopefully you can all celebrate all the women in your lives and also 
historical figures. So, moving into another fun month and of course really happy to see the 
City moving to the Red Tier. I don't know Director Hillis if you have any updates on how 
that might change anything for the Department, if we expect to see more Shared Spaces 
opening. I know we have had that underway to help with the businesses and just curious if 
there are any changes afoot with the Shared Spaces Program or other kind of business 
related recovery programs. 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
You know, related to that, obviously, indoor dining and kind of, you know, easing of 
restrictions on indoor dining. With Shared Spaces we will be coming to you in the next 
couple of months with the hopes to make that program permanent. So, you know, 
hopefully we can continue to enjoy Shared Spaces post COVID and allow businesses to 
occupy those spaces formally used for cars. So, we look forward to that discussion in the 
future.
