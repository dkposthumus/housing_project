Commission Comments/Questions 
 
 
Commissioner Diamond: 
Commissioners, this week, I believe we all received a letter from Georgia Schuttish, asking 
us to hold a hearing on the demo calcs. At least for the two years that I've been on the 
Commission, Ms. Schuttish has been incredibly persistent in raising this issue, and virtually 
every hearing. And I'm wondering, Director Hillis, if it might be useful, now that section 317 
– I’m going to stop for a second because I also hear the blue angels, I'm just going to let 
them pass. I'm wondering if it might be useful, now that 317 has been in effect for a number 
of years, to step back and look at what the underlying policy goals were and what the 
experience has been. What we have accomplished, what's working, what's not working, and 
have a hearing that's broader than just revising the demo calcs but looking at the whole 
issue in general. I think it's a good idea, when we adopt a new policy to see how it is actually 
worked out in practice and see whether or not any tinkering or broader amendments are 
necessary in order to accomplish those goals.  So, I was curious about your thoughts on that 
type of thing.
