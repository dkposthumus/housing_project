5. LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 
President Tanner: 
The Planning Commission acknowledges that we are on the unceded ancestral homeland of the Ramaytush 
Ohlone, who are the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula. As the indigenous stewards of this land 
and in accordance with their traditions, the Ramaytush Ohlone have never ceded, lost, nor forgotten their 
responsibilities as the caretakers of this place, as well as for all peoples who reside in their traditional territory. As 
guests, we recognize that we benefit from living and working on their traditional homeland. We wish to pay our 
respects by acknowledging the ancestors, elders, and relatives of the Ramaytush Ohlone community and by 
affirming their sovereign rights as first peoples.

7. COMMISSION COMMENTS/QUESTIONS 
President Tanner: 
Great. Just want to welcome everyone back to 2024. Happy New Year, everyone. Hope you all had a restful 
holiday season. I know also it's flu, RSV, Covid season. I had a little cold as well so I'll be wearing my mask 
intermittently today and just invite all those who want to, just to remember and be mindful of illnesses going 
around. If you are sick, do please stay home. That would be great. And I just also have to, it's a little out of our 
region, but congratulate the Michigan Wolverines on the national championship. Go Blue. Very exciting day on
