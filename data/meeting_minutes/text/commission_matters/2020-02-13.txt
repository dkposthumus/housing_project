Commission Comments/Questions 
 
Commissioner Moore: 
I would like to restate my concerns about the light grey printing of our commission reports 
and the drawings. They are definitely not readable. And actually, I talked with staff and 
they had the same problem. We need to take a magnifying glass to discern a very light 
grey printing and it's probably the vendor needing to change cartridges or something. I 
don’t know.   
 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
Commissioner Moore, we are looking into this issue and we are addressing it to the vendor 
and we may need to end up changing our procedures of reverting back to having project 
sponsors submit the plans on their own. Currently they are being printed through 
ReproMail, or whatever they’re called, that we, a vendor that we send out our case reports 
to. But if this continues to be a problem, we will revert back to having project sponsors 
submit plans on their own.   
 
Commissioner Moore: 
Thank you so much for being responsive to that comment.   
 
Commissioner Fung: 
I would request again the status on our new offices. Where are we with that and how is it 
progressing? And any operational issues are coming with some new aspects that are 
current at that office.   
 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
Commissioner Fung, we are also scheduling an informational presentation for you from 
those that are leading that effort.
