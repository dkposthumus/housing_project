(K. DURANDET: (628) 652-7315) 
2861-2899 SAN BRUNO AVENUE (AKA 90-98 WOOLSEY STREET) – east side between 
Woolsey and Wayland Streets; Lots 037 and 022 in Assessor’s Block 5457 (District 9) – 
Request for Conditional Use Authorization under Planning Code Sections 303 and 317 to 
address multiple Notices of Violation from the Planning Department and Department of 
Building Inspection by removing 20 dwelling units constructed without the benefit of a 
permit within five contiguous buildings on Lot 37 that are currently authorized for ground 
floor retail sales and service uses, second floor non-retail sales and service uses, and a total 
of 10 dwelling units on the third and fourth floors (five flats per floor, across five buildings). 
Also, the proposal seeks to legalize the de facto demolition of the building at 2861 San 
Bruno Avenue (Lot 22) that contained two legal dwelling units and currently proposes to 
provide ground floor commercial, second floor non-retail sales and service uses, and one 
full floor flat at each of the third and fourth floors. As proposed, the Project (inclusive of 
Lots 037 and 022) would result in 12 dwelling units within six contiguous, four-story 
buildings. The Project also includes twelve off-street accessory parking spaces, 12 Class 1, 
and three Class 2 bicycle parking spaces. Lastly, the Project also seeks to modify the 
method of inclusionary housing compliance, as described in Condition of Approval No. 10-
15 from Motion No. 18782, changing from providing one on-site affordable housing unit to 
payment of the in-lieu fee. The Planning Department found that the current project is 
exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The Commission’s action 
constitutes the Approval Action for the project for the purposes of CEQA, pursuant to San 
Francisco Administrative Code section 31.04(h). Findings under CEQA were previously 
adopted as a Final Mitigated Negative Declaration at the original entitlement for the 
project on Lot 037 heard by the Planning Commission on January 17, 2013 and approved 
per Motion No. 18782 for the demolition of an existing service station and new 
construction of five four-story buildings with ground floor retail, second floor
