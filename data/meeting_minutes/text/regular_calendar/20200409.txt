BALBOA RESERVOIR PROJECT – north of the Ocean Avenue Neighborhood Commercial 
District, west of the City College of San Francisco Ocean Campus, east of the Westwood 
Park neighborhood, and south of Archbishop Riordan High School, Assessor’s Block 
3180/Lot 190. This is an Informational Presentation on the proposed Balboa Reservoir 
Mixed-Use Development Project, located in the Balboa Park Station Plan Area at the site of 
the SFPUC Balboa Reservoir. Reservoir Community Partners LLC, the project sponsor, seeks 
to develop the approximately 17.6-acre site for a multi-phased, mixed-use development. 
The proposed project would rezone the site, establish land use controls and design 
standards, and provide for development of up to approximately 1.8 million gross square 
feet (gsf) of uses, including approximately 1.3 million gsf of residential space 
(approximately 1,100 dwelling units plus residential amenities), approximately 10,000 gsf 
of community space (childcare and a community room for public use), approximately 
7,500 gsf of neighborhood-serving retail, up to 550 residential parking spaces and up to 
750 public parking spaces. The project would also build new streets, pathways, and a total 
of approximately 4 acres of new public open space. The proposed project would modify 
the existing height limits of 40 and 65 feet to heights ranging from 40 to 78 feet. The 
project would require amendments to the General Plan and Planning Code, creating a new 
Balboa Reservoir Special Use District. This presentation will provide an update on the 
project, including the proposed package of public benefits.

Harry Bernstein – Under utilized 
Reservoir site described: underutilized? No! 
PUC often evaluated site; cancelled reservoir (1978).  
1) (1945-’46) WAVES barracks  
2) (1946-’54) CCSF West Campus  
3)  paved reservoir basins since 1958—SFPUC invited student parking, 
declaring: wouldn’t make North Basin surplus.  
Balboa-Park-Station Area Plan Housing element, ~425-500 units housing 
each, upper/lower reservoir—plan developed over years. BRCAC 
principles/parameters devised for maximum 500 units. RFQ: proposals for 
1100+ units accepted unquestioningly, contradicting assumptions from 
BRCAC process; public misled. 
6/25/19, Developer applied—Environmental Leadership Development 
Project (ELDP)—AB 900. Governor recognized it—12/30/19. Such projects 
get expedited judicial review—CEQA. 
Developer DIDN'T REVEAL COMMENT PERIOD, ending 7/28/19 Why?—
overlapped CEQA. 
Public Resources Code, SECTION 1. 21178 (c) Legislature finds and declares 
all the following: 
>this legislation applies to “large projects…that would replace old, 
outmoded facilities with new job-creating facilities to meet…regions’ 
needs…”  
BR project  = new facility, not old and outmoded. DID NOT DESERVE ELDP?
