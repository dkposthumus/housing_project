The site is considered a Preference 2 under the City & County of San Francisco's Wireless Telecommunications Services (WTS) Facilities Siting Guidelines, as it is a "co-location" site. However, due to a prior Planning Commission action and approved Motion No. 16084 for case no 2000.0385C the site had been deemed a Preference 6.  The Planning Commission will consider under which Preference (2 or 6) to review the application.  Sprint has also modified the location of the proposed rooftop mechanical penthouse from their original proposal.

Kirk Scott
Re:  Discretionary Reviews
- He is not a developer but he has been stuck in the Discretionary Review process as well as the Board of Permit Appeals process for two years trying to get a building permit.
- It is a very simple project.  The previous Planning Commission modified the project but the neighbors were not satisfied with that result and they brought him before the current Planning Commission and now to the Board of Permit Appeals.
- Any kind of delay costs thousands of dollars.  This has been very disruptive to his family.
- He had made all sorts of plans but has not been able to see them through.
- It is getting to the point that he will have to accept the changes his neighbors want.
- He feels that he has been put on trial three times for a simple building permit.
- He wanted to expose these comments and concerns to the Commission before discussing Discretionary Review reforms next week.
Adjournment: 8:56 p.m. in memory of Robert McDonald.
THESE MINUTES ARE PROPOSED FOR ADOPTION AT THE REGULAR MEETING OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON
