450 RHODE ISLAND STREET - RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT WITH RETAIL AND 17TH AND RHODE ISLAND STREETS LEGISLATION FOR A GROCERY STORE SPECIAL USE SUBDISTRICT.Certification of Supplemental Environmental Impact Report:  Assessor's Block 3978, Lot 1 which is approximately the whole of the block between Rhode island, Mariposa, 17th and Kansas Streets.  The proposed project consists of  two elements: the first is two ordinances introduced by the Board of Supervisors amending the San Francisco Planning Code (including Zoning Maps 8 and 8SU) to change the zoning on the block bounded by Rhode Island, 17th, Kansas and Mariposa Streets from M-1 (Light Industrial) to NC-3 (Moderate-Scale Neighborhood Commercial).  The proposed legislation would also add Section 781.10, which would create a 17th and Rhode Island Street Grocery Store Special Use Subdistrict applicable to the block described above to permit a neighborhood grocery store with beer and wine sales on that block.   The second element is a proposed development that would involve the construction of a five-story building ranging in height from 16 ½ feet to 52 ½ feet and containing about 204,800 square feet of mixed-use residential/retail space.  The project would include approximately 168 residential units, approximately 4,000 square feet of retail space, and approximately 34,500 square feet of grocery store space.  In addition, a parking garage would partially occupy three levels, providing a total of approximately 323 self-park off-street parking spaces.  The new proposed building would step-up the north slope of the Potrero Hill project site (Assessor's Block 3978, Lot 1), which is bounded by 17thStreet on the north, Rhode Island Street on the east, Mariposa Street on the south, and Kansas Street on the west.  The project site is within the M-1 (Light Industrial) zoning district and within a 40-X height/bulk district.

- She does not agree to a continuance request because nothing can be changed if the project does not get started.
Peggy Lenartowicz - Jersey Street Neighbors for Responsible Growth
- She just received the plans less than one week ago.
- The new plans are incomplete.
- There are about 900 signatures throughout Noe Valley and the City of San Francisco who are opposed to the project.
- A continuance is desperately needed.
Lou Blazej

- There are a lot of people who just do not like this project.
- He hopes that the Commission will hear this project because the project sponsor has done all they can to accommodate the issues and requests from the neighbors.
Paul Catis - East and West Castro Street Improvement Club
- There are a lot of items that need to get "ironed" out so a continuance is appropriate.
SPEAKER(S):
Re:  Merits of the Case
(+) Lou Blazej - Project Sponsor
- He displayed a photograph of the current location and the proposed structure.
- He and the Project Sponsor have done their best to meet the concerns of the neighbors.
- There will be six residential units, more retail space, no new curb cuts, metered parking, etc.
(-) Paul Kantus - East and West of Castro Improvement Club
- This building is a four story building on a two story building block.

- There should be restrictions on the residents of this structure.
- Many of the neighborhood associations of the area are against this project.

- She requested a condition requiring developers to provide parking at another location, prevent public access from the back for security, privacy and noise.
- She also requested that the Planning Commission authorize residential parking permits on three blocks of Jersey, Church, Sanchez, Noe and Castro.  This would mitigate the impact on parking.
(-) Stephen Jane - Jersey Street Neighbors for Responsible Growth
- He lives on Jersey Street.
- He is opposed to the design plans because they don't show dimensions and don't show the height at all.
- The Commission cannot evaluate accurately the impact of a building until there are design drawings that accurately show the height of all the existing structures that surround the buildings and that accurately show dimensions.
- He asked the developer to provide a diagram showing the relationship between the proposed building and the buildings on Jersey Street and they did not provide this to them.  The information on the story pole showing the height was not provided to them either.
(+) Brandon Mere - Painting Contractor
- The project will have a Victorian facade with pleasant color schemes and top quality materials inside and outside.

- Because of the elevation of the home, and if one is standing on the roof of the project, the roof tops of the homes appear as if they were all the same elevation.
(-) Clara Filter
- She has belonged to Friends of Noe Valley since 1971 after she lost a Planning battle by one vote and was told it was because they were not organized.
- She is worried about the precedent this project will create in the area.
- If everyone involved had been at the three meetings with the Friends of Noe Valley, seen what is being presented today, there would be a lot less to talk about tonight.
- They were never shown these new facades or modifications.
(+) Carol Deny - President of Noe Valley Merchants Association
- When this project started they were unhappy with a number of Issues, they were unhappy with the design specifically.
- They just want to make sure that designs in Noe Valley follow the Residential Design Guidelines.
- They are very happy with the Victorian design.
- The other issue that the Merchants have is that they actually wanted the parking and they were convinced by Friends of Noe Valley that it would be much better for the neighborhood, for walking on 24th street, if they gave in on the issue of parking.
- As far as he is concerned, the design that they saw this week met with satisfaction of the Merchant Association, and they are very happy with the response they got from the builder.

- Many other buildings are over 30 feet.

(+) Joe O'Donaghue - Residential Builders
- People seem to think that what is big is ugly.
- This project sponsor in this instance is putting as much incredible attention to detail In the rear of the building as he is on the front of the building.
- When one looks out the window, one will mostly see a beautifully designed building from the rear.  As well as obviously what would appear from the front.
(+) Rodrigo Santos - Structural Engineer
- His firm was asked to do a structural investigation of the [existing] building.
- He made the investigation on observations and testing.
- He found it is not only a blight but structurally unsound building.
- It is made out of all bricks with practically no mortar.
- The framing is 2 by 8 framing.
- There is no structural element in that building according to code.
- He is suggesting a complete demolition of the building and replacement with an architecturally well thought out structure.  And that is what has been presented by the project sponsor.
(+) Drake Gardner - Principal Designer
- When he initially designed this project, he went full envelope allowed by the Planning Code, including parking.
- He went with a modern design.  He always tries to integrate in the community if he can.
- Although we're modernists, we are quite able to do traditional buildings.
- He presented this project to the community and got a lot of feedback.
- It became apparent that the height and bulk were going to be an issue, the style was going to be an issue.  So they had to rethink the project.
(+) Lou Pine
- He has worked in the lighting industry in San Francisco for 19 years.
- He deals with all sorts of builders.

Preliminary Recommendation:  Take Discretionary Review and Approve the Project with Modifications.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Raymond Hill - Discretionary Review Requestor
- He moved into this area in 1981.
- He is concerned that the new construction will pass the back part of his house and he will open his window and there will be a wall there.
- He is also concerned that the project will make his house lose value.
- The new construction is just huge.
(-) Tom Bura
- He welcomes construction in the neighborhood because they want to be good neighbors, but the project sponsor should abide by the fact that this is a Single-Family home area.
- If this project is built as proposed it will increase the parking problems in the neighborhood because the house has a garage for one car only.
(-) Brian Trahian
- The concerns that most of the neighbors have is that most of the homes in the neighborhood are made up of single-family, modest homes that are mostly owner occupied, but this construction is begging to be converted into a multifamily type of dwelling.
- This project is three times the size of the homes in this neighborhood.
- It just really needs to be scaled down.
(-) Chris Vera
- He is concerned with the size of the new construction.
- He believes it is just too large for the neighborhood.
(-) Anderson (did not state last name)
- He is opposed to this project because it is too large.

- It just does not fit into this neighborhood.

465 DAY STREET- south side between Noe and Castro Streets.  Assessor's Block 6640 Lot 008.  Request for Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application No.2002 1218 3820, to construct a two story rear addition to the existing two story one family dwelling in an RH-1 (Residential House, One Family) District, and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and Approve the Project with Modifications.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Deborah Delambert - Discretionary Review Requestor
- She has a correction; it is not true that her building is taller than the proposed plan.  It is somewhere above her second story.
- She is not opposing to the square footage that this project is proposing.
- She is just asking that the second story of the building not protrude so far into the backyard, this would be in keeping with the neighborhood character and pattern of development.
- She displayed photographs comparing the Project Sponsor's plan with her plan.
(-) Scott McFurdy
- He lives on Day Street, one lot east and downhill from the proposed project.
- He did not agree to the modifications as proposed.
- He wants to reiterate what was said in that he is not opposed to the development of this property or to the square footage that the project sponsor wants.
- He is actually in favor of that.
- What he is opposed to is the distribution of the square footage because it will have a negative impact on him as immediate neighbors and to the neighborhood as a whole.
- He feels that 461 Day will bury his home.
- The project will dump him between an existing 17 foot high wall to the east and a proposed even bigger 24 foot wall plus a peaked wall to the west.
(-) Chandler Visher
- He and his wife own property on Day Street.
- He would like to hire an architect to develop a plan that would be architecturally consistent with the present plan.
- One of the concerns the project sponsors had was that they don't like the idea that their present plan has a different slope than the existing slope.
- The existing slope is steeper.  He feels that a plan that is more consistent with the neighborhood would be better.
(+) Jane Phillips - Project Sponsor
- She has lived on Day Street for nearly 23 years.
- What she is proposed is a modest expansion for only the amount of space that she really needed.
- She has had several meetings with the neighbors.
- She believes that the compromises they have made are significant and reasonable.
- She is willing to make changes to satisfy the neighbor's request.
- She does not understand how this project impacts her neighbors.
(+) Ronald P. St. Clair
- Since the filing of their permit application in December of last year, they have met with the neighbors on various occasions.
- He thought he had resolved the issues.
- He looks forward to continuing his neighborly communication regarding this matter.
- He has made every effort to avoid having to come here today.
- He has tried to accommodate his neighbor's concerns without sacrificing the architecture of his home and the modest space that they have.
(+) Sarah St. Clair
- She lives with her parents and often wonders why she is living in a closet.
- She really wants a second story.
- She believes that sometimes her life and the live of her parents would be much easier if - Her parents are very hard-working people and they need more space to work.
(+) William Pashelinksy - Project Architect.
- The design of the new building will clearly change the appearance of the current cottage.
- One of the points brought up was the nature of tearing down these types of houses and having the impact upon San Francisco Streets.
- The project sponsor feels strongly in terms of preserving the feeling of a cottage.
- The rooms are so modest in size that Sarah's bedroom cannot have a closet.
ACTION: Take Discretionary Review  with the following modifications of the subject building permit application:  Revision R-1 of the Building Permit Application for the project shall be approved as submitted on July 31, 2003 provided that the closet and window on the west wall of the second floor bedroom shall be flipped on the plan  such that the projecting close is moved forward on the building.
AYES: Antonini, Bradford Bell, Boyd, W. Lee
ABSENT: Feldstein, Hughes, S. Lee
