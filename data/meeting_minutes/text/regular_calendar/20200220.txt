HUNTERS VIEW HOPE SF DEVELOPMENT PROJECT – 227–229 West Point Road, Hunters View 
is generally located along Middle Point Road between Evans Avenue and Innes Avenue and 
along Fairfax Avenue between Keith Street and Middle Point Road, all Lots in Assessor’s 
Block 4624 (District 10) – Request to modify Planned Unit Development originally approved 
under Planning Commission Motion No. 17621 (pursuant to Planning Code Sections 303 and 
304), which facilitated the complete reconstruction of the 22.5-acre Hunters View housing 
development, including the demolition of the previously existing 267 units, and the 
construction of 800 new units (replacement affordable units, new affordable units, and 
market rate units), approximately 6,400 gsf of retail, 21,600 gsf of community space, and 
new streets and publicly accessible parks and open space. This modification would change 
the conditions of approval by: (1) extending the period of performance for another ten years; 
(2) allowing ten-percent modifications from the Design-for-Development standards; and 
(3)  requiring that the Commission be notified of subsequent phases rather than requiring 
automatic informational presentations before the Commission; and amending the  Hunters 
View Design-for-Development document by (1) allowing two buildings on lots 14 and 17 up 
to a height of 65-feet, as allowed by PC Sec. 263.23(c)(5) and within the height limits of the 
40/65-X Height and Bulk District; (2) enabling  some required usable open space be met on 
adjacent newly created public open space; (3) enabling the reconfiguration of two of the 
parks in the development; (4) clarifying parking ally entries are not subject to parking garage 
dimension requirements; and (5) removing the project-specific parking requirement to 
allow parking controls be determined by the underlying zoning.  The subject site is within a 
RM-1 (Residential, Mixed, Low Density) District, Hunters View Special Use District, and
