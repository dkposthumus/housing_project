in Assessor’s Block 1069 (District 2) – Request for HOME-SF Authorization pursuant to 
Planning Code Sections 206.3 and 328 to construct a 65-foot tall, six-story mixed-use project 
with 42 dwelling units and a ground floor commercial use within the Geary Boulevard NCD 
(Neighborhood Commercial District) Zoning District and 40-X Height and Bulk District. The

purchase prices ranging 80% of the Area Median Income (AMI) to 130% of AMI. The 
remaining 70% of dwelling units will not be subject to AMI restrictions. The HOME-SF

allows for the proposed fifth and sixth stories, and for form-based density. The project is also 
requesting modifications, pursuant to Planning Code Section 206.3(d)(4), of the rear yard 
and exposure requirements. The project is also subject to the Transportation Demand
