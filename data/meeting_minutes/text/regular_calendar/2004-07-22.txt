            for off-street parking and usable open space for an upper-floor group-housing 
            use.
Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Rudy Columbini - Project Sponsor
- He was raised in San Francisco.
- He has been involved with real estate and music all of his life.
- This would be a haven for aspiring musicians and recording artists.
- This would be the first time a school, rehearsal facility, hotel, and 
        a music venue have ever been looped together.
- Musicians can come from all over the city, the country and the world 
        and have a place where they can flourish and pollinate each other.
(-) David Brown
- He is opposed to this idea.
- He has lived in the area for 30 years.
- The area is also a residential district with a senior home nearby. 
        This is going to lead to more problems because of the early morning hours 
        of operation.
- He does not want the Commission to pass this because of the violence 
        and prostitution in the area.
(-) Jack Rummel
- There are a lot of problems with prostitution and drug dealing in the 
        area.
- His concern is related to the residential hotel aspect of the project.
- He does not agree with the late night hours.
(-) Doug Backsberg
- He lives on Sutter Street.
- He opposes allowing any conditional use.
- He is appalled that he has to be here since the area is filled with 
        bars, homeless shelters, needle exchange, etc.
- Fern Alley is only one way, this would cause a problem with the bar 
        since there would be a need for a two way street.
(-) Robert Pangburn
- He owns property in the neighborhood.
- He has been working against the crime and prostitution in the area. 
        A lot of groups have been formed in order to control these problems.
- There are crime maps put out by the police that state what kind of 
        crimes are conducted in San Francisco neighborhoods.
- There are 237 prostitution incidences, 109 larceny and theft incidences, 
        etc.
(-) Gus Holinsgworth
- He has lived on Sutter Street for about 20 years.
- He is opposed to this business because of the stated crime problems.
- Even though the resources are there to fight the crimes, adding businesses 
        that will help increase the crime is bad for the neighborhood.
(-) David Overdurf
- He would like to have a continuance of this project because there should 
        be more public outreach.
- The project sponsor should have more time to meet with the neighbors.
- The bottom line is "what is important to the community"
- If the Commission approves the project, there will be a lot of unhappy 
        people.
- If the Commission does not approve this, it might not be fair to the 
        project sponsor.
(-) Suzie Shimizu
- She is an administrator at Redding School. Every day the children see 
        prostitution, drug addicts, etc.
- There should be some type of program for children passed instead.
(-) Robert Hutchinson
- He has lived for 43 years on Sutter Street.
- He would like to have this project denied because there are too many 
        bars in the area.
- This neighborhood has grammar schools and two old folks homes .
- The area should be rezoned since the community does not want any more 
        bars.
(-) Jenny Hansen
- She is the executive director of a senior center.
- She is opposed to the project.
- There are already a lot of crimes going on in the area.
- Many of her staff have been mugged.
- A minimum should be to just continue the project if not deny the project 
        all together.
(-) Karla Rossi - Sutter House Apartments
- She is a property manager.
- There is a music studio on Fern Alley and there are already negative 
        impacts going on now.
- She is opposed to live entertainment.
- More information should be sent to the residents of the neighborhood.
(-) Robert Garcia - Save Our Streets
- This is a bad idea. He is not against the school/training facility.
- The bar aspects of the project will cause more problems.
- Parking in the area is scarce.
- On the same block can be found a senior center, a school, etc. This 
        should be cause for denying this type of use.
(-/+) Jeremy Nelson - Transportation for a Livable 
        City
- They support the parking variance. He is isolating his comments to 
        the variance only.
- The project is located in an area where there is excellent transportation.
- He is sympathetic to the issues of noise, problems with neighbors, 
        etc.
- He recommends to have strict good neighbor gesture conditions applied 
        to the project so that within a period of time there could be an evaluation 
        of these conditions to make sure they are being followed.
(+) Jim Riddick
- He lives on Fern Alley.
- He understands the people that have lived in the neighborhood for a 
        long time and their concerns with crime.
- The live music will be on the Bush Street side.
- A continuance would be acceptable so that they can give more information 
        to their neighbors.
- It is not all about the bar, it is more about the community of musicians 
        coming together.
(-) Bob Frane
- He is opposed to the proposal even though what the project sponsor 
        is doing is something good.
- Parking is very bad in the area. Late at night is even worse.
- He has not heard anyone address the square footage usage of the building.
- If this is allowed as it stands, later down the line, the conditions 
        should be revisited again.
- There is a lot of noise on Bush Street.
- The neighbors are trying to make the area better. He would agree to 
        a continuance so that everyone can get to know the project sponsor more.
(-) Mr. Leonard - Noise Control
- He has come up with a plan so that the project sponsor can have this 
        project and have little impact on the neighbors.
- He agrees that young musicians need a place to rehearse and that this 
        place should be sound controlled so as not to disrupt neighbors.

        the project sponsor to continue discussing issues with neighbors. Public

SPEAKER(S):
Re: Continuance
Christopher Moscone - Representing Project Sponsor
- He requested a continuance because there are only four members of the 
        Planning Commission.
- If there were a continuance it would allow the [staff] recommendation 
        and analysis to be looked at and corrected--there is a lot of information 
        that is not correct.
- A continuance would be in the best interest of both parties because 
        it would allow them to meet and come to a decision.
Joe O'Donaghue
- He agrees to a continuance only if the project could be scheduled on 
        August 5.
- His clients had to come from Italy for this hearing.
Name unclear
- He agrees to a continuance.
- He just recently hired an attorney. This would allow the attorney to 
        familiarize himself with the case.

(Continued from Regular Meeting of June 10, 2004)
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Walter Kaplan - Discretionary Review Requestor
- The notice published for this project contains an incorrect statement 
        of what the project proposes as well as the description of the project.
- This is an awful project.
- The issue here is not what could be built under the code but what should 
        be built.
- The project sponsor should be allowed to build but within the envelope 
        of the structure.
- There have not been any plans since May 21.

        neighbor's house.

(-) Doris Linnenbach
- She has lived in the neighborhood for 25 years.
- They are delighted to have the Popofs come to the neighborhood but 
        are not in agreement with building a monster home.

- He is concerned with the project because it does not maintain the roofline.
- He is not too concerned with the façade.
- He made conditional changes to the plans of the houses he has under 
        construction so never had to come before the Commission.
(-) Chirs Deyo

- He has been a resident since 1988.
- He loves the neighborhood and would love to have a neighbor who keeps 
        up with the property.

- It seems that the neighbor next door does not want to deal with the 
        issues of the project even though he is the Discretionary Review requestor.
- The project sponsors have gone through a lot to revise the plans.
- He is in support of the project.
ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and approved the project with the following 
        modifications: require a maximum height of 23.6 inches for the new construction; 
        file a notice of special restrictions to allow one dwelling unit so long 
        as the property is zoned for single family housing; nothing in the future 
        should extend beyond the approved height.

            approve the project.

        space from Lucky Brand.

- Many restaurants serve ice cream for desert.
- She submitted signatures of residents who are opposed to the ice creamery.
- She is concerned with the destruction of the family owned businesses 
        on that street.

        site. This decision is only his and his brothers.

(Continued from Regular Meeting of June 24, 2004)
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Bruce Bonacker - Representing the Discretionary 
        Review requestor
- The concerns that remain on this project are the scale, precedent, 
        and presence of light and air.
- The addition is more than 70 percent of the size of the house even 
        though there has been reference to this being a modest addition.
- He presented a few alternatives, which would be a one-bedroom addition.
- The other alternative would change the size of the deck. This alternate 
        responds to the needs of his clients.
- These revisions were not acceptable to the project sponsor.
- Everyone is concerned about the precedent this will have on the neighborhood.
- He would be satisfied with either of the alternatives.
(-) Kathy Kora

        neighbors will be loosing a lot.
- He is concerned with the privacy he will be loosing.

- He is asking for an additional offset.
- The rear deck should be eliminated because it will only encroach into 
        his yard and his privacy.
(-) Lisa Chin
- Her house is on the south of the proposed project.
- She is not here about views or property value. She is here about scale 
        and neighborhood character.
- She and her husband constructed an addition with the required permits.
- All they are asking for is a skylight.
- She hopes that the Commission will allow Discretionary Review.
- The project sponsor promised a few things but then he retreated and 
        mentioned that he over spoke.
(-) Thomas Chan
- They have been thrust into turmoil trying to reach a compromise.
- The project will impact their privacy and they will lose a lot of light.

- After careful consideration of the plans, she decided to sign the petition 
        for DR.

- They have tried to reach a compromise and try to satisfy the needs 
        of the neighbor.
- Their children's well being is being compromised with this new construction.
- An important factor when they purchased their home was light and that 
        is going to be minimized with the construction.
- She requested that the project sponsor set back the addition and remove 
        the deck.
(-) Buff Harding, Jr. - Golden Gate Heights Neighborhood 
        Association
- He has been in the neighborhood for 45 years.
- He has watched the congestion grow over the years.
- He would like to have some compromise where everyone is in agreement.
(-) Sue Hestor
- The Chan's will be looking at a wall if this project goes through.
- All the DR requestors want is to have the emergency stairs not be enclosed.
- Ms. Coto is a homebound person that wants light. This has nothing to 
        do with views.
- The neighbors have gone out of their way with the architect to find 
        alternatives.
(+) Arnie Lerner - Representing Project Sponsor
- There are no special and extraordinary circumstances that warrant Discretionary 
        Review.
- The project should be constructed as proposed.

        Home Owner's Association, which states that they support the project.

        children and his wife's mother. Now his children are pre-teens and should 
        be allowed their separate rooms.
- He requested that the Commission deny Discretionary Review.
(+) Toyoko Swingle
- They have tried to do their best to talk to their neighbors and reach 
        a compromise.

        suggested.

- They have tried to do their best to be good neighbors.
(+) Eiko Shintake
- She is the mother of the project sponsor's wife.
- She is 74 years old and shares the room with her grandchildren.

        it to be a normal size.
- She requested that the Discretionary Review be denied.

        tells his friends that he sleeps in the same room with his grandmother 
        and his brother.
(+) Masashi Swingle
- He would also like to have his own room with his own desk. He now does 
        his homework on the dining room table.

- She lives on the same block.
- The project sponsors have involved her in the project and have addressed 
        her issues.
(+) Mimi Jones
- She has seen the plans.
- This project would not adversely change the character of the neighborhood.
(+) Myriam Chan
- She supports this project since the project sponsor's family is growing. 
        It is time for the children to have their own space as well as their grandmother.
- The addition would be invisible from a pedestrian point of view.
- The Planning Commission should support growing families.
(+) Vickie Fan
- She lives down the street from the Swingles.
- Expansion of existing space seems to be the only way for families to 
        stay in San Francisco.
- After the project sponsor expands, they will still not have a very 
        large house.
- It is important to find a way for families to stay together.
(+) Darvin Huang
- When he walks through the area, the houses look very nice.
- He does not feel that the expansion will detract from the architecture 
        of the existing homes.
(+) Mark Stoklosa - Project Architect
- He took into consideration the zoning, building and planning restrictions 
        when designing this addition.

Re: Discretionary Review Process
- He lives on 9thAvenue.
- He would encourage the Commissioners to revise the DR process.
- For $140 anyone can DR a project.
- There are so many opinions because there is such a diversity of people 
    in San Francisco.
- There should be a more efficient DR process--perhaps put more of a financial 
    burden on requestors.
