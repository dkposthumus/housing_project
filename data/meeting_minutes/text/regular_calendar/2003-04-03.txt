Re:  Continuance
Robert Wales

- He would like to have this case heard today.
Barbara Janeff

- She is not really happy about the delay.
Kenneth Thompson
- He owns property that is very close to where the antennas will be installed.
- He would like to have this matter settled today.
Jennifer Donnely

Re:  Merits of the Case
(-) Robert Wales
- He lives on Beach Street.
- He is less than 100 feet from these proposed antennas.
- He is concerned about the radiation, reduction of property values, etc.
- He contacted Verizon Wireless about the noise that will be heard during the installation and they were not very helpful.
- He can think of various locations where these antennas can be placed where they are not close to people's homes and people's bedrooms.
(-) Erika Tarantino
- He is aware of various neighbors who were not able to come and who are against these antennas.
- The building in question is already a very bulky building.  These antennas will be unsightly and not aesthetically pleasing.
- Verizon told the neighbors that the fans, which will be installed, would not make any more noise than regular traffic.
- No one can guarantee her and her neighbors that there will not be any health affects.
(-) Barbara Janeff
- The problem she has with these antennas and this proposal is that when one is installed, it will be cause for other carriers to come and install their antennas, creating an antenna farm.
- This will cause a disruption in people's lives.
(-) Kenneth Thompson
- He lives on the top floor of the proposed building.
- It is outrageous that something like this would be proposed in a residential neighborhood.
- He is concerned with the health hazards.
(-) Madeline Camisa - Committee for Antenna-Free Marina
- She is opposed to this installation.
- The carrier already has two cell sites in the Marina.
- These sites should provide more than adequate coverage to the area.
- According to a survey, 90% of cell phone users were very satisfied; of these 18% were Verizon users.
- Please reject this proposal.

Preliminary Recommendation:  Approval with Conditions

SPEAKER(S):

There has not been adequate notice of this project.
(-) Rose Wang
- Her neighbors have opposed any antennas in the area.
- She would like to have the Commission disapprove this application because there have been many changes to the project and this causes confusion to the neighbors.  Service from Cingular is very satisfactory.
