Preliminary Recommendation: Do Not Take Discretionary Review and Approve the Project.
(Continued from Regular Meeting of December 2, 2004)
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Steve Williams - Representing One Discretionary Review Requestor
- The lot in question does not appear in any of the Sanborn maps.
- The project does not have a rear yard.
- The other lot is substandard.
- The department would have given a different recommendation if staff had had the entire information.
- This project should be returned for re-analysis.
- The Building Department reports also gives information that is not correct.
- There is no need to rush through this project.
(-) William Marconi - 2ndDiscretionary Review Requestor
- The project would result in a tiny house and would decrease the value of the neighborhood.
- It would gravely affect the light and views of the house on the southeast corner of Stanyan Street.
- The project would also result in a loss of open space.
(-) Pennie Sempell
- She lives on Stanyan Street.
- She was denied vehicle access to her property.
- She was also denied fire access to the rear of her house.
- She is concerned about the legality of the construction.  The project will take away a parking area for people that don't have a garage.  The project infringes open space in the area.
(-) Oleg Obuhoff
- He is not against the variance.
- There are some questions about the true owner of the property.  There has been information that the property was either transferred or sold.
- Most of the neighbors would like to preserve the open space.
(-) David Weill
- He lives on Mountain Spring Street.
- He is opposed to the project because it is out of character with the single family dwelling structures in the area.
- There is a lot of traffic in the area because of UC Med.
- The driveway will take away some of the parking.
- He moved into his home in 1971.
- Before 1971, there was construction done to a home and there was water running out of the house.  There is still water running out of the house so he is worried that another construction will make things worse.
(-) Tav Matulla
- She and her husband have lived in the area for many years.
- She is against the project because it is very massive.
- There are many issues with this project that need to be dealt with before the project is allowed to move forward.

- He is extremely concerned about the negative tactics that the project sponsor has done.
(-) George Matulla
- There are a lot of discrepancies with the reports.
- The land maps are contrary to what is actually in the neighborhood.
(-) Terry Senne
- He lives on Stanyan Street.
- He joins his neighbors opposing this project.
- If there was a project that would be built to the detriment of the neighborhood it would be this one.
(-) Cathleen Clark
- She lives in one of the houses of the Stanyan Street steps.
- She is opposed to the project because there has been a lot of deceit and dishonesty.

(-) Leigh Sealy

- Open space, parking, nature of the hill, water that rushes down the hill are all the concerns that neighbors have.
- He would be most encouraged if the Commission would reconsider this project.
(-) Doris Linnenbach
- He agrees with the representative of the Discretionary Review requestor--this is not a simple project.  This project cannot be "rubber stamped" for approval.
- All the people who spoke would not come here if there were no real concerns.
(-) Dennise Lapointe - Twin Peaks Improvement Association
- The association has taken the stand to oppose this project because there are serious problems.
- She submitted a letter with the issues of why they are opposed.

- This is a very well designed project.
- This is not a "City giveaway" project.
- The lot is not substandard.  The lot is about the same size as nearly every lot on Clarendon Avenue.
- The project meets all the requirements of the Planning Code.
- The issue of deceit, which was spoken about, is simply not true.
- The project sponsor was very open about everything they have tried to do with the project.
- The project is actually a very attractive one.
(+) Mark Brand - Project Developer
- He displayed a diagram of the proposed project.
- They have made quite a number of good neighbor gestures.
- He displayed another diagram showing how the house would not cause shadows to the adjacent house and how the light wells help with brining sun to the house.
(+) Joe O'Donaghue
- The question is that the project is conforming to the code.
- Parking and open space is an issue of every development no matter what neighborhood.
- There are issues for various agencies of the City.
- This is a typical San Francisco case.

- He lives on the same street.

1598 DOLORES STREET- northwest corner of 29thStreet; Lots 40 through 52, inclusive, in Assessor's Block 6618 -Request for Conditional Useauthorization to modify conditions of approval set forth in Planning Commission Motion Number 16445 as modified by Board of Supervisors Motion Number M02-163 and relating to Planning Department Case Number 2000.1058C to allow payment of an in-lieu affordable housing fee rather than provide on-site affordable housing, pursuant to inclusionary housing policies set forth in Planning Commission Resolution Number 16350. In September of 2002, the City authorized construction of two 4-story buildings on the subject property containing a total of 13 units and up to 26 independently accessible off-street parking spaces; both buildings are now complete. Conditions of approval require one of the proposed units to be provided as a Below Market Rate (BMR) unit. This proposal would modify previous conditions of approval to allow the payment of an in-lieu fee to the Mayor's Office of Housing rather than provide the required BMR unit on-site. No physical work is proposed. The property is within an NC-1 (Neighborhood Commercial Cluster) Zoning District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
