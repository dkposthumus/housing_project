(K. DURANDET: (628) 652-7315) 
2861-2899 SAN BRUNO AVENUE (AKA 90-98 WOOLSEY STREET) – east side between 
Woolsey and Wayland Streets; Lots 037 and 022 in Assessor’s Block 5457 (District 9) – 
Request for Conditional Use Authorization under Planning Code Sections 303 and 317 to 
address multiple Notices of Violation from the Planning Department and Department of 
Building Inspection by removing 20 dwelling units constructed without the benefit of a 
permit within five contiguous buildings on Lot 37 that are currently authorized for ground 
floor retail sales and service uses, second floor non-retail professional service uses, and a 
total of 10 dwelling units on the third and fourth floors (five flats per floor, across five 
buildings).  The proposal also seeks to legalize the exceedance of construction and the de 
facto demolition and modification of original approval to allow 2nd floor non-retail 
professional services and two residential flats on the third and fourth floors of the building 
at 2861 San Bruno Avenue (Lot 22). This building was originally constructed as ground 
floor commercial, and two residential townhouse units at the second, third and fourth 
floors. The proposal will restore the buildings to their original approved features, including 
various façade modifications.  As proposed, the Project (inclusive of Lots 037 and 022) 
would result in 12 dwelling units within six contiguous, four-story buildings. The Project 
also includes twelve off-street accessory parking spaces, 12 Class 1, and three Class 2 
bicycle parking spaces. Lastly, the Project also seeks to modify the method of inclusionary 
housing compliance, as described in Condition of Approval No. 10-15 from Motion No. 
18782, changing from providing one on-site affordable housing unit to payment of the in-
lieu fee. The Planning Department found that the project is exempt from the California 
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The Commission’s action constitutes the Approval 
Action for the project for the purposes of CEQA, pursuant to San Francisco Administrative 
Code section 31.04 (h).
