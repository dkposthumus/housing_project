22. 2000.1081EMTZ                                 (R. COOPER: (415) 558-5974)
RINCON HILL PLAN-Certification of Environmental Impact Report. The proposed project is a revised Rincon Hill Plan (an Area Plan of the San Francisco General Plan) and revised planning controls for the Rincon Hill area. The San Francisco Planning Department proposes to replace the Planning Code's existing Rincon Hill Special Use District (SUD), as set out in Planning Code Section 249.1, with a new Rincon Hill Downtown Residential Mixed Use District (DTR), which would increase height limits, revise the "R" bulk district, amend the Rincon Hill Area Plan, and make other General Plan and zoning changes intended to stimulate additional high-density, residential development in the Rincon Hill area. Improvements to the streetscape, transportation system and open space would result from implementation of the new Plan. Rincon Hill is in the northeast section of San Francisco, south of the Financial District and Transbay Terminal, and north of the South Beach neighborhood. The project area is bounded generally by Folsom Street, Steuart Street, The Embarcadero, Bryant Street, the Bay Bridge approach and the Transbay Terminal ramps and encompasses about 12 city blocks.
NOTE:The public hearing on the Draft EIR is closed. The public comment period for the Draft EIR ended on December 10, 2004.  The Planning Commission does not conduct public review of Final EIRs.  Public comments on the certification may be presented to the Planning Commission during the Public Comment portion of the Commission calendar.
