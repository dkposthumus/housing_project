WATERFRONT PLAN RELATED GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENTS – Initiation of General Plan 
Amendments to amend the Recreation and Open Space Element, the Northeastern 
Waterfront Area Plan and the Central Waterfront Area Plan. The Port of San Francisco’s 
proposed Waterfront Plan would update the 1997 Waterfront Land Use Plan, which sets 
long-term goals and policies to guide the use, management, and improvement of 7.5 miles 
of properties owned and managed by the Port of San Francisco.  The nine goals and polices 
proposed by the Plan include but are not limited to preservation and enhancement of the 
waterfront’s function as a maritime port, hosting a diversity of activities and people, 
enhancing public access and open space along the waterfront, the design of quality new 
development and preservation of the waterfront’s historic character, strengthening the 
Port’s resilience to climate change impacts, and cultivating an environmentally sustainable 
port to limit the impacts of climate change. The General Plan Amendments would update 
the two area plans and element to assure they are aligned with the proposed updated 
Waterfront Plan and other City policy actions and developments that have occurred since 
they were last updated.
