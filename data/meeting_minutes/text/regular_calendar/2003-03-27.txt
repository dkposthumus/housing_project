HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE - FINAL DRAFT FOR PUBLIC REVIEW-  Staff presentation of Housing Element Final Draft for Public Review released February 10, 2003.  The Planning Commission will also consider a resolution of intention to adopt proposed amendments to the General Plan.  The resolution of intention only enables the publication of a formal notice for a public hearing.  It is at that future hearing that the Planning Commission would consider the proposed amendments to the General Plan under the provisions of Sections 340 and 306.3(b)(3) of the Planning Code.  Proposed revisions will update the Residence Element adopted in 1990 and include an assessment of housing needs, new policies to increase housing production such as higher residential densities along appropriate transit corridors and downtown neighborhoods; encouragement of housing development in neighborhood commercial districts; reconsideration of residential parking requirements; and policies supporting construction of new family housing.  The Final Draft for Public Review incorporated modifications based on comments and other feedback received by the Planning Department in the first draft.
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Daryl Higashi - Director of the Mayors Office of Housing
- San Francisco is far behind in having a housing element accepted by the State of California.
- There are funding programs that organizations will be able to apply for with this measure.
- If there is no adopted plan approved by the Commission and or approved by the Board of Supervisors, San Francisco will not be able to apply for housing funds from the State.
- This opportunity should not be missed.
- He is in support of this plan.
- Supporting this plan allows for market rate housing.
- He hopes the Commission will continue to work with staff to move along this initiation.
(+) Olson Lee - Assistant Deputy Director of the Office of Housing at the Redevelopment Agency
- The agency's housing plan is incorporated with the City's annual housing plan also.
- There is a need for more affordable housing as well as a need to save and preserve affordable housing.
- Housing is difficult but it is more cost effective to save affordable housing than to build fresh.
- There is a need for a compliant housing element.
- He urges the Commission and staff to do whatever can be done to expedite the process and allow for the appropriate public comment on the housing element.
(-) Steven Linder
- The housing element encourages secondary units near transit and this increases crime.
- Families with children are a protected class under California law and they have certain needs.
(+) Joya Calagos - SFOP
- They believe that San Francisco should be a City for all.
- City policy should promote families and communities.

(+) Oscar Herrera - SFOP

- This policy is very important.  The decisions that the Commission makes will affect the children of this City and their future.
(+) Tracy Parent
- She is a real estate agent who works with immigrants.
- She urges the Commission to expedite this policy.
- Her one concern is that the implementation of the plan should be more explicit.

(+/-) Michael Harris - San Francisco Rev. Com.
- He has concerns about the draft housing element and the oversight of income to affordable housing and jobs for low-income residents.
-  The date and needs analysis section does not address the key relationship between jobs for existing residents that result from approved projects of this Commission.
(+/-) Susie Wong - Chinese Community Development Corporation
- She suggested having a senior staff person be in charge of the implementation of this policy.  That person could also be a liaison with the Board of Supervisors.

- This policy should not be approved in its current form.
- He encourages the Commission to expedite this continuance.
(-) Joe O'Donahue
- The housing element does not address why the delivery system failed and why the housing crisis since 1986 keeps getting worse and worse.
- The delivery system is a shambles.  There is a disparity between housing costs, housing crisis, and construction.
- There is a need to get some economists and do some econometrics.
(-) Jill Kent
- There is much concern about the housing element.
- There has not been good notification about this proposal.

(-) Bernie Choden - SFT
- The draft element does not meet the requirements for this City, and it does not provide the tools needed.

(-) Mary Anne Miller
- There is a major demand for housing in her district.

- Her organization is willing to help because they are housing friendly.
(-) Dan Kalb - SFT
- His comments regarding the proposed document:  1) It is important that developers not get away with just having all the same unit sizes in a given large development; 2) there should be higher density on large transit corridors; 3) financing is the biggest challenge; 4) the increase in housing stock has to be approved and built in proportion and concurrent with improvements in infrastructure and transit services; 5) there should be hearings throughout the City before this document is finally approved; 6) educational programs to inform the values and reality of new housing; 7) he suggest that there be caution about asking for any CEQA exemptions.
- He supports much of what Mr. Calvin Welch spoke about.
(-) Marilyn Amini
- The newspaper wording stated that this hearing was for an intent to adopt and now it has been changed to an intent to initiate.

- He requested that this be continued for at least 60-90 days in order to get sufficient input from his neighborhood.

(-) Eric Quezada - MAC
- He does not know whether to just laugh, cry or through his hands up from frustration.
- It is important to move this policy forward after receiving the proper input from neighborhoods.
- It is getting very difficult for neighborhoods to believe that there is a process that rally matters.
(+/-) John Bardis - Inner Sunset Action Committee

- This should not be a final draft since there has not been a draft in 13 years.
- There has not been any environmental review.
- There is a need for public review and it has not been presented to the public yet.
(-) Hiroshi Fukuda - Richmond Community Association
- He is glad that the Director of Planning has mentioned that there will be future neighborhood input because this is a very important policy matter.
- The citizens need to read this.  Copies should have been provided at all public libraries and the Supervisors should have copies to provide to the residents of their districts.
- A document that is this important needs a lot of public comment.
(+) Cris Durazo - SOMCAN

(-) Nahla Awad
- She read a letter from a member of San Francisco Merchants Association who requested that this item be continued in order to receive more public comment.
(-) Sue Hestor
- This document is contradictory to the policy of the Planning Department since the Department approves a housing project just to have housing.
- The income levels need to be looked at.
- Demolition policy also needs to be looked at closely.
- The most affordable housing is what should be analyzed.
- Any housing does not equal housing.
(-) Tom McDonaugh
- Housing is a basic human need.
- Only one third of the people living in San Francisco own their own housing.
- San Francisco needs to make sure that the inhabitants of the City are home owners--this is a long time benefit to this City.
- Part of the backbone of the City was excluded from home ownership.
- housing is so expensive because it is highly controlled.  That is why it (prices) continues to escalate.
