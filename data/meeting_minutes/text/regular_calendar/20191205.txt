RETAINED ELEMENTS SPECIAL TOPIC DESIGN GUIDELINES – Adoption: design guidelines 
that apply at the discretion of the Planning and Historic Preservation Commissions to sites 
that propose to retain and incorporate existing building elements into new development. 
They work in concert with the Urban Design Guidelines and consistency with both sets of 
guidelines is mandatory in the approval process. These guidelines are not considered to 
meet the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties by 
the Planning Department and would not result in a less than significant impact to 
individual historic resources for the purposes of CEQA review.
