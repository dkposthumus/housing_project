[1]•         Sacramento Street. The Land Use Committee considered an ordinance sponsored by Supervisor Farrell that would allow a very limited change to the Sacramento Street NCD.  This ordinance would permit a change of use from Business or Prefessional Services use to Medical service use provided that no active use or residential space is lost.  You recommended approval with two minor technical amendments on February 21 of this year. This week Supervisor Farrell amended the Ordinance per your recommendations and the Committee recommended approval of the revised Ordinance.
•           The Committee also recommended approval of a landmark designation for 320 Judah Street also known as the Doelger Sales Building.  The HPC recommended landmarking this building on October 3, 2013. Supervisor Wiener signed on as the legislative sponsor.
