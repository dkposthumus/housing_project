pursuant to Planning Code Sections 321 and 322, to obtain an additional 3,426 square feet 
of office use. On October 22, 2020, the Planning Commission authorized the development 
of 403,750 square feet of office use at Block 15 (Station A) under Motion No. 20801. However, 
upon an updated calculation of the Regional Housing Needs Allocation pursuant to 
Proposition E, only 400,324 square feet of office use was available in the Office Development 
Annual Limit at that time. The proposed Office Allocation would confer the 3,426 square feet 
that were previously unavailable. The property is located within the PPS-MU (Potrero Power 
Station Mixed Use) Zoning District and 65-PPS/240-PPS Height and Bulk District. The Project 
has undergone environmental review pursuant to CEQA and Chapter 31 of the San Francisco 
Administrative Code. On January 30, 2020, the Final Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was
