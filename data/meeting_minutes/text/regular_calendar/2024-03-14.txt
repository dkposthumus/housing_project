WATERFRONT RESILIENCE PROGRAM – Staff will provide an Informational Presentation to the Commission on 
the San Francisco Waterfront Coastal Flood Study (Flood Study). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), in 
collaboration with the City and County of San Francisco, has reached an important milestone in the Flood 
Study—the release of the Draft Plan on January 26, 2024. The Draft Plan is a major step forward in securing 
federal funds to address the waterfront’s flood and earthquake risks for the 7.5 miles of waterfront within the 
Port of San Francisco’s jurisdiction, from Aquatic Park to Heron’s Head. It indicates approximately where to build 
coastal flood defenses and how much sea level rise future coastal flood defenses will manage before they need 
to be adapted to higher water levels. If approved by Congress, the federal government will pay up to 65% of the 
funding to implement the plan—leading to potentially billions in federal funding to reduce coastal flood risk 
from sea level rise and make related seismic, stormwater flooding, and waterfront improvements. San Francisco
