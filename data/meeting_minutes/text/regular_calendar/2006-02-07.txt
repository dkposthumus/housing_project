SPEAKERS:Marilyn Amini- In a January 31st. communication by the Department, the statement is made that the Department initiated a new Better Neighborhoods plan along Geary Street.- Initiation of a new planning area requires Commission action.- I have some material that was taken out of the Better Neighborhood file and it's authored by David Alumbaugh, and it's actually pertaining to the Geary Corridor and talks about initiation and the fact that there has to be Planning Department initiation hearings.- To my knowledge, there has been no Commission initiation hearing where public can comment on it.- If you take action on the budget today, will your action on the budget automatically and/or by default be action to endorse the Geary Better Neighborhoods without the Brown Act required public comment, adequate notice, et cetera?- How can the department initiate without Commission initiation hearings and without the public comment?ACTION:  ApprovedAYES:  S.
