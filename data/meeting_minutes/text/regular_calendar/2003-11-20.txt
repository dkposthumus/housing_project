SPEAKER(S):
(-) Jason Hoffman - Discretionary Review Requestor
- He and his father are concerned with a lightwell that provides necessary light and air to the residential and commercial units.
- He displayed shadow analysis photographs to prove how much impact the new construction will cause.
- There is also an issue of a fire escape stairwell that will be impacted.
- The project will also be inconsistent with the other properties in the neighborhood.

- If the project were to be approved, he would like to have some modifications:  remove the stairwell penthouse, paint the building in a light reflective color and install a half garage that is below grade.
(-) Michael Morris
- He lives on Anza Street.
- This project would affect the light coming into his kitchen.
- The air coming through his windows would also be compromised.
(-) Pat Burns

- If this project is approved, it would be very devastating to two particular units.
- She has no problem with the building being built, just do it with a few modifications.
(+) David Silverman - Reuben and Alter - Representing Project Sponsor
- The DR requestor is a landlord of a non-conforming building, which contains 6 apartment units and commercial units.
- The DR requestor will still enjoy light and air to the west and the east.

474 MAGELLAN AVENUE- north side between Cortez and Montalvo Avenues; Lot 014 in Assessor's Block 2926 - Request of Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application No. 2002.12.30.4339, proposing to construct a three-story rear and side addition and a new rear exterior stairway connecting all levels of the existing single-family to the rear yard. The proposed rear exterior stairway requires a rear yard variance (Case No. 2002.1307V). The Zoning Administrator held and closed a public hearing on the variance on March 26,2003, a decision was not made. The subject property is in an RH-1 (D) (Residential, House, One-Family, Detached Dwelling) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project as submitted.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Bruce Bonacker - Project Architect
- He submitted documentation that included the Assessor's block and pinpointed the project sponsor and Discretionary Review requestor's homes.
- The proposed building will be very large as compared to the other homes in the neighborhood.
- There have been two alternatives offered:  the first was proposed and was rejected by the project sponsor.  The second alternative would be the issues resolved by both parties.  Those issues consist of eliminating an interior corridor and moving the side addition to the south.
(-) Ed Koblowitz
- If the project sponsor had done what they said they were going to do -- be willing to speak to the neighbors, etc. -- then he would not be here.
- This is a project that can be done.  But it is important to respect the rights of the neighbors.
- He has 15 letters objecting this project.
(-) Diane Sampson
- She lives on Magellan Street.
- She is very sad to be here because she does not want to have an adversarial relationship with the project sponsor.
- She works at home so the impact from the construction will be tremendous.
- The light, air, and pleasantness of her home will be gone if this project is approved as proposed.
- She feels that a compromise will be possible if everyone works together.
(-) Grace Shanahan
- She lives in the neighborhood.
- A compromise is very important here.
(-) Harold Wright
- There is some room for reduction in this expansion.
- He visited the neighbors to see the negative impact.
- The proposed project would cast a shadow on the adjacent home.
(+) Jim Reuben - Reuben and Alter - Representing the Project Sponsor
-  He did not receive a copy of whatever materials were handed to the Commission and he has been at the hearing today for a few hours.
- The threshold is extraordinary and exceptional circumstances.  This case is about a single site line from one northwest window of the DR requestor's house.  The complaint from the DR requestor is very minimal.
- He displayed a lot map displaying how many households support the project sponsor.
- The claim that this house is huge is outrageous because the lot coverage is smaller than the ones on the same block.
- The staff has done site visits and has noted that there have been a lot of improvements done by the project sponsor to be good neighbors like, building a lot line fence, relocating a third floor window, use of dual glaze exterior windows and a shadow study.
- The architect is here to answer any questions.

The proposed rear exterior stairway described under 2003.0399D would be one floor level higher than the first floor of occupancy above the ground story and would extend nine feet into the 25-foot required rear yard for the portion that is more than three feet above grade. The subject property is in an RH-1 (D) (Residential, House, One-Family, Detached Dwelling) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District. The Zoning Administrator held and closed a public hearing on the variance on March 26, 2003 and will issue a variance decision after the Discretionary Review hearing
SPEAKER(S): Same as those listed in item 15a.
ACTION: The Zoning Administrator Closed the Public Hearing and has taken matter under advisement with conditions: 1) there will be no direct access from the ground floor au pair room except through the sliding doors; 2) the project sponsor will pay up to $3,000 dollars to the Discretionary Review requestor for them to install a skylight at their option.
Items 16 & 17 were called and heard together.

EASTERN NEIGHBORHOODS COMMUNITY PLANNING- The Planning Commission will discuss and possibly adopt Interim Policies and/or discuss and direct staff to prepare a resolution for initiation of Interim Controls.  Planning Department staff will provide a status report on the Environmental Review process for the Rezoning of the Eastern Neighborhoods.  The Planning Commission will also schedule a subsequent hearing to review and discuss the work scope of Public Benefit Zoning and Community Impact Report (Socio-Economic Analysis) and to discuss non-conforming uses.
Preliminary Recommendation: Adopt Interim Policies
(Continued from Regular Meeting of November 13, 2003)
SPEAKER(S):
My Do - Mission Economic Development Association
- She presented some data regarding PDR businesses particularly--those in the Northeast Mission.
- In 2002, MEDA worked with the Planning Department to survey PDR businesses.  For the Northeast Mission there were a total of 39 respondents.  Roughly half of these respondents had been at their location 10 years or more and 44 percent had been at their location 4 to 10 years, indicating that these businesses are relatively stable.
- In the survey, half as many businesses were planning to expand. Forty-two percent of the businesses indicated they were considering relocation.
- The primary reasons for relocation were: lack of space, high rents, payroll taxes and incompatible neighbors.
- One can infer that the PDR businesses are relatively stable but found themselves in a less than friendly environment due to previous land use decisions.
Jim Meko - SOMA Leadership Council
- He passed up sign-in sheets that cover a 2 ½ year period of events that the SOMA leadership council has sponsored.  This represents the outreach that they tried to really involve the community in talking about Planning in the SOMA.
- He is not here to speak of all of SOMA.
- There is a general satisfaction with the current zoning in SOMA.
- The 1990 zoning is good zoning, although everyone does not agree with all of the zoning.
- The loop holes have been closed up.
- It is time for everyone to get over it and move forward on this.
Curtis Eisenberger - Mission Coalition for Economic Justice and Jobs
- He tanked the planning staff for being more open and inclusive recently and start to listen to concerns of property owners and businesses in the Northeast Mission.
- He thanked planning staff for not taking a precipitous action last week on interim policies or interim controls because these need more work and more studies.
- Regarding policies vs. controls, the Coalition does not see the need for either of these.  But if one had to make a choice, it would be policies instead of controls.
- The proposed controls categorizes PDR by size and not by use.  This is a mistake.  He has concerns over properties that would become non-conforming under the new proposed zoning.  He wants to encourage more flexibility in PDR.
- He does not agree with the 1 to 4 ratio of PDR replacement.
- He urges that the Commission not take action this evening.
Thomas Shuen - Asian/Mission Business Association
- He urges the Commission not to make a rushed decision.
- When a policy is adopted it should be citywide and not just from one district to another.
- He urges the Commission to analyze all aspects of the question.
Milton Gaines
- Last week Commissioner Antonini asked for specific examples of PDR uses leaving the City due to Planning and Zoning policies.  During the last 60 days, Margery Baer, costume jewelry with 20 employees quietly sold her building and moved to South San Francisco.
- The Mission Interim Controls passed by Supervisor Amiano in 2001 actually implemented a moratorium on new housing in the Mission.
- He believes that policies should be passed instead of controls.
Jeffrey Leibovitz
- He urges the Commission not to put forward interim controls.
- Interim Controls require additional public hearings.
- He urges the Commission to adopt policies.
Fred Snyder
- He thanked the Commission for giving the public another week to look at the document.
- He realizes that things are being rushed but this is very important in order to get everything on the table.
- He showed a map of the Mission/MEMIZ and how it is a core PDR area.
Phillip Lesser - Mission Merchant's Association
- He concurs with the earlier speakers that there should be policies and not controls, specifically for the shopping corridor of Mission/Valencia, 16thStreet, 24thStreet, etc.
- This is a very transit rich area in San Francisco and it is important to know how to encourage development.
- It would be horrific to do something to downzone density.
- He implores the Commission not to discriminate against the Mission again.
- Parking should be "unbundled."
Shawn Gorman
- He lives in Potrero Hill.
- The current map that is being proposed for the controls or policies is very wrong.
- He displayed a revised map which identified the areas that are not going to change--17thStreet, and option B.
Alice Barkley
- She has written a letter to the Commission which states a lot of the points that have been addressed by other.
- This Commission needs to adopt interim policies and not controls.  Policies will allow staff to evaluate each case.
- The major objection she has is the November 13, 2003 map which is totally contrary to the community consensus of the 17thStreet area.
- One cannot measure PDR by size.
- Putting core PDR across a park can cause a lot of problems.
Shawn Keighran
- He is about to purchase a property on 17thand Carolina Streets.
- The process has been in place for 14 months.  Plan B called very clearly and very specifically for a pedestrian friendly atmosphere on 17thStreet.
- Last Thursday, Mr. Ghosh of the Planning staff came up with a plan that is contrary to what was being presented before.  If there were going to be meetings, why were the public not listened to.
- He feels he is owed an explanation.  He feels that it is cowardly that Mr. Ghosh is not here this evening.
Luis Granados
- He is here to remind the Commission about the decision they will be making in a few weeks.
- This is not something that the public hopes to get.  The decision of the Commission can either strengthen businesses or destroy them.
- There is a sense of unreliability with the numbers in the document.
- There have been a lot of PDR spaces that have been converted to business services.
- Some of the spaces are being purposely kept off the market because they are waiting for the office market to pick them up.
- Focus groups, surveys, and interviews have been done to get information on PDR businesses.
- He encouraged the Commission to think of the alternative 2 benefits and think about who benefits from this?
- He urged the Commission to adopt interim controls.
Emeric Kalman
- About 42 days ago, since the October 9, 2003 hearing, he raised a few points--mainly that the department violated the provision of due process of the Sunshine Ordinance.
- He also mentioned the sections which were not followed.
- He is here to ask again if the issues which he raised were taken care off.  The Ethics Commission can only investigate violations of the Sunshine Ordinance if one notifies the respondent of the alleged violation within 40 days before filing a complaint.  The respondent did not get the alleged violation.
- The Commission is doing spot zoning.  This is out of control.
Tai Via - Cobletz, Patch, Duffy and Bass
- She was here last week urging the Commission to leave West of SOMA out of these policies.
- Since that time it has come to the attention of the Leadership Council and it is their consensus that they agree with leaving West SOMA out of the controls.
Michael Halprun
- Housing is what this City needs.
- If is very clear that people who have spoken are not looking at housing.  They are looking at protecting jobs, and developments.
- It is important to create opportunities for young people to live here.
ACTION: Hearing Held.  Public Comment Closed for Tonight.  No Action at this Time.  However, it was requested that streets be identified on the maps.  Next hearing is scheduled for December 18, 2003.
