            of a nonconforming nighttime entertainment use, pursuant to Planning 
            Code Section 181. The existing facility ("Club Six"), located 
            on the ground and basement levels, is a nightclub, bar, and lounge, 
            and proposes to expand by adding 2,450 square feet at the ground floor 
            and 2,042 square feet at the basement level, resulting in a total 
            of 8,647 square feet for the establishment. The subject property is 
            in an RSD (Residential / Service) Mixed-Use District with an 85-X 
            Height and Bulk district.
Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Mark Rene - Representing the Project Sponsor
- It is noted on the materials that 6thand Market had been the premier district for theater use after World 
            War II, then there was a decline. Since 1990 the area started a late 
            night revival.
- 6thStreet after 11:00 p.m. is one 
            of the premier districts now for late night entertainment.
- These types of businesses create a safer area.
- Staff has recommended approval with conditions. 
            However, he would recommend that the hours change from 5 p.m. to 4 
            a.m. on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights and nights 
            before National Holidays.
(+) John Peterson - Project Architect

            bar.

            bar.

            prostitution and make the area safe.

            Solutions from the Redevelopment Agency
- Mr. Cruz is a member of the Board of Directors.

            on a project called Six on Sixth.

            been doing very well.

            of the week would hurt the business.
- Many entertainment venues exist with resident 
            units above.
(+) Gerald Sampson
- He is a resident of 6thStreet.
- He knows the owner and there have not been any 
            problems with the club.

            They have actually passed a resolution declaring San Francisco in 
            a health crisis for the lack of venues for young people.

            entertainment venues.

(+) C. Cheng
- He has worked with Mr. Cruz on booking events.
- A lot of people have said that they are not 
            sure about going into this neighborhood. The ones that decide to come 
            realize that they can keep coming back to other events.
(+) Terrance Allen - President of the Entertainment 
            Commission
- With the formation of the Entertainment Commission, 
            the Planning Commission can differ many of the responsibilities they 
            have had related to entertainment.
- The conditions that are before the Commission 
            are not from the Entertainment Commission but from the Police Commission.
- They want to standardize, across the City, the 
            way entertainment venues relate to their neighboring businesses and 
            residential uses.

52-60 6th STREET- northwestern corner 
            at Jessie Street; Lot 6 in Assessor's Block 
            3703 -Request for Variance -Section 151 of the Planning Code 
            requires one parking space be provided for each 200 square feet of 
            occupied floor area, where the occupied floor area exceeds 5,000 square 
            feet. The proposal to expand the project results in a total of 8,647 
            square feet for the establishment. The project expands the existing 
            use beyond the 5,000 square foot parking threshold and would require 
            52 parking spaces. The project does not propose to add any parking 
            spaces and therefore requires an off-street parking variance. The 
            subject property is in an RSD (Residential/Service) Mixed-Use District 
            with an 85-X Height and Bulk district.
SPEAKER(S): Same as those listed for item 13a.

            with a full-service restaurant on the ground floor. The proposed conversion 
            would not alter the size of the existing building. Because the existing 
            building already encroaches into the required rear yard, it is considered 
            a legal, non-complying structure, and the conversion of the two upper 
            floors from commercial use to residential use triggers these variances.

Preliminary Recommendation: Approval
SPEAKER(S):
(+/-) Terrence Allen - President of the Entertainment 
            Commission
- Why is this coming forward at this time? This 
            legislation needs to be understood.
- This legislation came forward as a "knee 
            jerk" reaction to the change in programming at a club located 
            at 220 Jones Street as opposed to a well thought out piece of legislation.
- He does not know all of the details of what 
            will be amended.
- There has to be an equanimity into the law.
- The definition of "adult entertainment" 
            needs to be defined.
- He has the third draft of this legislation available.
(+) Earl Jogers - Chaplain San Francisco Rescue 
            Mission
- The City has almost studiously avoided regulating 
            this industry and this needs to be done.
(+) Bill Barnes
- If the goal is to not have children near these 
            adult entertainment venues, then some guidelines need to be established 
            for both.
ACTION: Adopt with Modifications: 1) Define what 
            adult definition is; 2) a school (K-12, private or public) cannot 
            locate within 1000 of an existing adult entertainment facility; 3) 
            shall not be considered a non conforming use under Section 180 of 
            the Planning Code and may therefore be intensified or expanded; 4) 
            childcare facilities shall make themselves known regardless of size; 
            5) notification shall be given to residents of the neighborhood and

SPEAKER(S):
Re: Continuance
Walter Kapland - Representing Discretionary 
            Review Requestor
- There is a substantial number of neighbors that 
            would like to have a continuance since they were only able to meet 
            with the project sponsor just a few evenings ago.
- The Planning process works well when things 
            are resolved outside of Planning Commission hearings.
- Sutro Tower agreed to do a seismic retrofit, 
            which will be finished this weekend. This project is not good for 
            the neighborhood.
- He asked the Commission to request another meeting 
            with the neighbors and the project sponsor to talk about height, bulk, 
            etc.
Jeremy Paul - Representing Project Sponsor
- This item has been continued several times.
- It is time to get this project resolved.
(The above comments were taken under the ITEMS 
            PROPOSED FOR CONTINUANCE category. It was decided to address that 
            question at the call of the item.)
Re: The question of Continuance was again heard 
            at the call of the item.
Walter Kapland
- He submitted a copy of a letter from Paul Negalscue 
            who is withdrawing his support of the project.
- All the people who had supported the project 
            have withdrawn their support.
- He believes that this project can and should 
            be approved in a modified way in the future.
- To have a hearing now would open scabs and put 
            "salt on wounds." This project will not allow for neighbors 
            to talk and find solutions.
Jeremy Paul - Project Sponsor
- During the brief discussion that was held before 
            the hearing, there was mention that the Commission had recently received 
            information therefore justifying a continuance.
- There is no new information. The comments from 
            the neighbors were filed on April 20. A lot of staff time has been 
            spent on this. There is no time to get involved any more.
ACTION: Without hearing, item continued to July 
            22, 2004

            19th and 20th Streets; Lot 001A in Assessor's Block 4065 -Request 
            for Discretionary Reviewof Building Permit Application No. 2003.08.11.1725 
            proposing to construct a one-story vertical addition to the existing 
            one-story over garage building in an RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) 
            District with a 40-X Height and Bulk Designation.
Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary 
            Review and approve the project as submitted.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Gayle Keck - Discretionary Review Requestor
- They are in complete agreement that if the project 
            sponsor agrees to install a skylight in their home, they would agree 
            with the project.
- They have not received a response regarding 
            the request to install the skylight.
- She purchased the house about 20 years ago.
- The window in the bathroom is the only window 
            on that side of the house.
- She and her husband had to move away from San 
            Francisco but rented the house.
- The renters are really concerned about the light 
            that will be lost from that window.
- If they were forced to pay for the skylight 
            themselves, they would have to raise the rent and this is something 
            they do not want to do.
(-) Paul Herman
- He read a letter from the tenant that is currently 
            renting the property who requested that a skylight be installed because 
            otherwise the proposed project would block light and air to the bathroom.
(+) Claire Pitcher - Representing Project Sponsor
- The Discretionary Review requestor submitted 
            a bid and the cost for the skylight would be $16,500 - this is not 
            reasonable.
- She requested that the Planning Commission take 
            Discretionary Review and approve the project as presented by the project 
            sponsor.
ACTION: Take Discretionary Review and required 
            the project sponsor to pay up to $3,000 for the installation of a 
            skylight. Payment shall be upon proof of installation.

                  between 20th and Sierra Streets; Lot 28 in Block 4101 -Request 
                  for Discretionary Reviewof Building Permit Application 
                  No. 2003.09.19.5267, proposing to construct a horizontal and 
                  vertical addition to an existing two-family dwelling in an RH-2 
                  (Residential, House, Two-Family) District and a 40-X Height 
                  and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary 
            Review and Approve the Project as Proposed.
(Continued from Regular Meeting of May 20, 
                2004)
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Susan Taggart
- This Discretionary Review is just about preserving 
            the open space.
- Land for gardens is at a premium.
- They want to keep development into the open 
            space at a minimum.
- Her aunt purchased the house recently so she 
            is very interested in what is built.
- There are no buildings that match the project 
            sponsor's project.
- Because there is a flat roof, the height of 
            the extension would be extremely high.
- Bring the extension back 4 feet or remove about 
            54 feet of living space form the proposed project. Require that all 
            roofs be fire rated and metal railings to be kept as parapets.
- They are not asking to change much.
- We are proposing these very small changes.
(-) Jean Taggart
- She is Susan's aunt and is 85 years old.
- The project would block sunlight to her property 
            and eliminate her privacy.
- Being next to her niece and nephew-in-law makes 
            her very happy.
(-) Lol Hansen
- He lives on the same block where the proposed 
            project will be located.
- The block that they live on has very modest 
            houses.
- Most of the lots there have gardens, trees, 
            shrubs.
- The addition is inappropriate for what is on 
            their block.
- To him, the project was shocking.
- There are also concerns of privacy.
(+) Steven Step - Project Architect
- He displayed a diagram of the proposed project.
- The units are not very large.
- The biggest issue is how they work with the 
            neighborhood and how to appeal to their concerns.
ACTION: Do not take Discretionary Review and approved 
            the project.
AYES: Antonini, Bradford Bell, Boyd, Hughes, S.
