- He is representing the residents of the building.  He submitted a petition representing people who are opposed to the project.

- There does not seem to be any consideration of the Residential Design Guidelines.

(+) Victoria Liveron
- She and her husband are planning to have another child for a total of three.
- Many of the homes in the neighborhood have gone through renovations.

- The other issue here is the rights of a property owner compared to the rights of the neighborhood.
- Since this has to be negotiated with the people that it impacts, they have made revisions to the plans to reflect their issues.
- He mentioned that although this is the developer's project, he as well and the project architect live in the neighborhood.

Re:  170 St. Germain
- He was unable to speak last week when this case was discussed during Director's Report.
- His personal integrity was questioned and he wants to clarify some issues.
- There was a notice of violation issued on August 6, 2004 and a complaint on August 6, 2004.
- He had spoken to the district building inspector at that time.  He had also reviewed the permit and seen the photographs that the Discretionary Review requestor's representative had illegally entered the site to take.  The inspector visited the site and was not concerned because he had determine that the house was not habitable.
- After the public hearing was held in July 2004, another inspector was assigned-different from the one who issued the notice of violation.
- If the Commission or staff have any questions, he is available.
- He has been doing this for 15 years and has never worked on a case that has caused so much staff time.
