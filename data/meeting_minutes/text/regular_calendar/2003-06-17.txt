450 RHODE ISLAND STREET - RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT WITH RETAIL AND 17TH AND RHODE ISLAND STREETS LEGISLATION FOR A GROCERY STORE SPECIAL USE SUBDISTRICT.Public Hearing on Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Report:  Assessor's Block 3978, Lot 1 which is approximately the whole of the block between Rhode island, Mariposa, 17th and Kansas Streets.  The proposed project consists of  two elements: the first is two ordinances introduced by the Board of Supervisors amending the San Francisco Planning Code (including Zoning Maps 8 and 8SU) to change the zoning on the block bounded by Rhode Island, 17th, Kansas and Mariposa Streets from M-1 (Light Industrial) to NC-3 (Moderate-Scale Neighborhood Commercial).  The proposed legislation would also add Section 781.10, which would create a 17th and Rhode Island Street Grocery Store Special Use Subdistrict applicable to the block described above to permit a neighborhood grocery store with beer and wine sales on that block.  The second element is a proposed development that would involve the construction of a five-story building ranging in height from 16 ½ feet to 52 ½ feet and containing about 204,800 square feet of mixed-use residential/retail space.  The project would include approximately 168 residential units, approximately 4,000 square feet of retail space, and approximately 34,500 square feet of grocery store space.  In addition, a parking garage would partially occupy three levels, providing a total of approximately 323 self-park off-street parking spaces.  The new proposed building would step-up the north slope of the Potrero Hill project site (Assessor's Block 3978, Lot 1), which is bounded by 17thStreet on the north, Rhode Island Street on the east, Mariposa Street on the south, and Kansas Street on the west.  The project site is within the M-1 (Light Industrial) zoning district and within a 40-X height/bulk district.
Preliminary Recommendation:  No action required
NOTE: Written comments will be received at the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m. on May 27, 2003.
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Ron Miguel
- He lives about three blocks from this project.
- He urges the Commission to move forward in considering this.  The supplemental is complete and is totally sufficient.  It will be good for the neighborhood.
(-) Babette Drefke
- The lot is very difficult to build on.
- Her main issue is the height of the proposed building.
- If the height could be kept down to 40 feet, it would be best for the neighborhood.
ACTION: Hearing held, no action required by the Commission at this time.

5894 - 5898 MISSION STREET-Appeal of a Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration,on an irregular-shaped parcel (Assessor's Block 7143 - Lot 33),at the northeast corner of Mission Street, Sickles Avenue, and Huron Street.  The proposed project involves the replacement/modernization of a gasoline station and construction of an AM/PM mini-mart, demolition of an existing Smog Pro building, removal and replacement of underground petroleum storage tanks (USTs), and partial site re-grading.  The 1,680-gross-square-foot (gsf) project building would result in an approximately 50-gsf expansion of the 24-hour commercial operation.  The project would retain the two Mission Street access points, eliminate a Huron Street access, eliminate a Sickles Avenue access near Mission Street, and retain the Sickles Avenue access closest to Huron Street. The approximately 18,000-gsf project site is located in the Outer Mission Neighborhood, is zoned NC-2 (Neighborhood Commercial) and is within the 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation:  Uphold the Mitigated Negative Declaration.
(Continued from Regular Meeting of April 24, 2003)
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Steve Currier - President of the Outer Mission Residents Association - Appellant
- He received a last minute document that he had to respond to.  Unfortunately, this meant he had to submit a letter to the Commissioners at the last minute.
- The project sponsor wanted to sell alcohol at the proposed gasoline station and the neighborhood is not in agreement with this.
- There is a 711 nearby.
- Members of the police department are here to speak on this item.
- He has been working with ABC, SFPD and the Planning Department regarding this issue.
- The neighborhood has many daycare facilities, three schools, recreation and park facilities, and facilities to assist in the fight against drug and alcohol abuse.  Selling alcohol perils the neighborhood.
- He hopes that the Commission denies this project.
(-) Alex Morillo
- He purchased the property near this location to try to clean up the neighborhood.
- There have been people that have vomited and defecated in the area because they have been so intoxicated.
- There was a store that closed because the owner was selling to minors.  He (the store owner) lost his lease and the neighborhood improved a little bit.
- He does not agree that the gasoline station should sell alcohol.
(-) Raymond Livera
- He lives behind the proposed project.
- The neighborhood is a very nice community and there are children living there.
- If the gasoline station is open 24 hours, this is cause for a lot of noise and a lot of problems.
(+) Peter Tate - Tait & Associates, Architects
- He agrees with the environmental report and with staff.

5894 - 5898 MISSION STREET- at Huron Street and Sickles Avenue, Assessor's Block 7143 Lot 033 - Request for Conditional Use Authorization under, Planning Code Section 178(c) for enlargement of a gas station with a convenience store open 24 hours a day; and Planning Code Section 229(b) to allow beer and wine sales at a gas station in an NC-2 (Small Scale Neighborhood Commercial District) and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions to not allow beer and wine sales among other things.
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Peter Tobin - Tait and Associates - Architects and Engineers
- ARCO submitted many letters from the neighborhood and neighborhood associations.
- This site was built in 1970.
- The project will eliminate a lot of confusion from people trying to enter from too many driveways.
- There will be pass-through traffic in three pump locations, there will be easier fueling positions, and the tanks will be completely replaced.
- The retaining wall will be more of a stucco type wall to match the aesthetics of the neighborhood.
(+) Donald Firenze - BP - ARCO
- He submitted a letter that explains the reasons for the request to sale beer and wine.
- Employees will go through a beer and wine sales training.
- They will be applying for more beer and wine licenses at other locations.
(+) Kenneth T. Wickerham - BP - ARCO
- He is the area Real Estate Manager.
- All of the facilities in the Bay Area are more than 30 years old.
- In most cases where there are larger lots, they include a car wash or other amenities.
- He hopes that this project will be something that the community will be proud of.
- If there is a maintained 24-hour facility, there is more control than if there is a facility that closes--which can give people the opportunity to sleep there and engage in other negative activities.
- He would like to have the option to sell beer and wine.
(-) Gina Haney - Outer Mission Residents Association
- She does not want to have the facility open 24 hours nor to sell beer and wine.
- Because this is on the county line, the police from San Francisco can not, or do not do much about any crime activity.
(-) Sharon Eberhardt - Cayuga Neighborhood Association
- It only makes good business sense to contact the neighborhood association either via a telephone call or a letter.  Her association was not notified of this project.
- It makes no sense to allow liquor.
(-) Catherine Pacheco - Outer Mission Residents Association
- She is opposed to any gas station in any city selling liquor.
- A lot of kids buy cigarettes and liquor.
(-) Steven Currier - Outer Mission Neighborhood Association
- He did speak with representatives of Tait and Associates several times.  He just wanted to clear that matter.
- They have gathered about 750 petitions against this project.
- His organization has been dealing with land use issues for a long time; this is the first time a project sponsor has not been in dialogue with his association dealing with neighborhood issues.  This makes a statement since it means that the project sponsor will not be a good neighbor.
- He implores the Commission that if this project goes through that there be strict conditions imposed.
(-) Raymond Rivera
- It is impossible for ARCO to say that they are not making any money since there is a tanker delivering gas every single day.  With the price of gas right now, they should be making a profit.
- His mother in-law's backyard is right next to the gas station and she has had many problems with this station.
(-) Officer Anna Brown - Ingleside Police Station
- A lot of the testimonies from the residents are quality of life issues and these do not get reported.
- The police are concerned about a gas station that has a mini mart that sells beer and wine and they do not want to support this.
- They have to listen to what the community wants.
(-) Alex Morillo
- There is a Walgreen's about four blocks away, a Safeway about eight blocks away, and an Albertson's about one mile away.
- ARCO has not been a good project sponsor because they have not communicated with the neighbors.
- ARCO will be able to get a profit even if they do not sell alcohol.
ACTION: Public Comment Closed. Continued to June 26, 2003 with instructions to the project sponsor to:  1) go back and look at site plans more closely and develop a placement of the storefront to minimize the impacts on the adjacent property owner; and 2) work with the community.  Staff was instructed to include in the conditions of approval the following: 1) construction is to start within three years or the conditional use will expire; 2) no 24 hour use; and 3) no alcohol sales.

SPEAKER(S):
Re:  Continuance
Andrew Zacks - Attorney for Appellant (Citizens for Better Streets)
- There are several reasons why this item should be continued.  One is the pending litigation against the City and County of San Francisco over the right of the City and County of San Francisco to transfer this property to the developer.  The matter which is currently pending in court may well result in a determination that the City and County of San Francisco does not have the right to enter into a lease agreement that has been proposed by way of a resolution adopted by the Board of Supervisors.
- This litigation involves a claim under the California Streets and Highway Code that the lease, which calls for a 50 year lease at ten thousand dollars a year to the developer, violates the Streets and Highway Code.
- The developer who has filed an environmental evaluation application and a conditional use application does not have standing under the provisions of the City Planning Code to seek such permits since only an owner has the right and power to file for a conditional use application.  It is clear that CCDC (the developer of this case) is not an owner of the property nor have they been authorized by the existing owners (the City and County of San Francisco) to file a permit application.
- If this matter is not continued, the Planning Commission is continuing in a matter where there is no jurisdiction.
(did not state name) - representing Jerlanni, Inc.
- He supports the request for a continuance.
- It is clear that the Mayor's Office of Housing does not have jurisdiction over this parcel.  The jurisdiction is under the Department of Public Works.  MOH does not have authorization to give to the developer.
- The Deputy City Attorney is not the appropriate person to give advice to the Commission and he objects to her participation in this matter since she is representing the MOH in litigation.
The Zoning Administrator responded:
- This item is in court.  There is litigation about whether the transfer is proper however the City prevailed on a request for a temporary restraining order.  There was no temporary restraining order.  From consultations with the City Attorney, the department believes that it is appropriate and that the hearing should go ahead.  The economic issues on whether it was an appropriate transfer under the State Traffic Code is not before the Commission.  What is before the Commission is the project.  The question about the economic issues and the amount of the lease is not before the Commission either.  What is before the Commission is if the environmental impact is adequate, the general plan issues, historic district issues and the conditional use.
- He submitted a letter of authorization from the Mayor's Office of Housing to the project sponsor who filed the Conditional Use and it includes the Real Estate Division authorizing the Chinatown Community Development Center to apply for a Conditional Use.  He consulted with the City Attorney on these issues.
The City Attorney responded (Audrey Pearson):
- What is before the Commission is an appeal of a Preliminary Negative Declaration.  The litigation and the Negative Declaration have nothing to do with each other.
- The Commission is able to go forward on this project.
- The city can also designate another department to allow the MOH to authorize CCDC to apply for the Conditional Use.
MOTION: Proposed for Continuance
ACTION: The Motion did not receive a second.  The Motion died.
RESULT: Item will be heard
Re:  Merits of the Case
(-) Andrew Zacks - Attorney for Appellant
- There is no questions that this project involves a major land change for the waterfront district.
- The project is going to affect traffic and air quality in a highly dense urban environment.
- There are other projects which have been proposed that will sit very near this project.
- The negative declaration does not evaluate the cumulative impacts on any of the issues that are required to be evaluated under CEQA.
- There are other projects that have parking issues.  There was no specific parking study for this particular project.
- They are concerned about the size of the building because it will block light and air.  There is no evaluation on this in the negative declaration.
- The transportation assessment relied on a report that was done for the Embarcadero/Broadway hotel project that he suggests creates a cumulative impact.
- At a minimum, there should have been a parking study.
- There will also be an increase in noise, but the negative declaration does not state that.
- He believes that a full environmental impact report should be issued.
(-) Richard Wall - Representing 100 Broadway Associates
- His building will be surrounded by this project.
- He feels that not having parking is negative to the neighborhood.
(+) Dan Talbot - San Francisco Tomorrow
- He feels that because there are no assigned stalls for the residents that this could actually be good environmentally.
- San Francisco Tomorrow analyses cases on a "case by case" basis.
(-) Erik Foraker - Giurland, Inc.
- His concerns related to the negative declaration are the setbacks and the light and air.
- He feels that there has not been a proper shadow study done.
- Regarding the request for setbacks, the variance should not be approved.
- The setbacks are not appropriate for the upper floors.
(+) Rose Pak - Chinese Chamber of Commerce
- She does not understand what air quality or parking problems people are talking about.
(+) Gordon Jim
- The people he is representing will speak on item 20 only.
(+) Henry Musto - Vice President - Joseph Musto Estate Co.
- He requests that a full environmental impact report be done on this project.

150 BROADWAY (aka 190 BROADWAY)- "Broadway  Family  Apartments," north   side
between Battery and Front Streets; Lot 011 in Assessors Block 0141 - The proposal is to construct a new mid-rise building that will contain 87 units of affordable housing with retail, childcare, and community spaces, built over an underground parking level accessed from Front Street and containing up to 41 off-street spaces. This project is proposed for land that is owned by the City and County of San Francisco, which is currently under the jurisdiction of the Department of Public Works (DPW) and is partially leased to a parking vendor.  The Board of Supervisors previously approved in principle the transfer of the property from DPW to the Mayor's Office of Housing for the development of affordable housing.  A General Plan Referral is needed at this time in order for the Board of Supervisors to consider (a) lease disposition and development agreement that will allow the affordable housing developer, Chinatown Community Development Center (Chinatown CDC), to move forward with development activities, and (b) a future ground lease between the City and Chinatown CDC to be entered into at the start of construction.  The subject property is zoned C-2 (Community Business), is in the Northern Waterfront S.U.D. No. 3, and in a 84-E Height and Bulk District.

(+) Kate White - Housing Action Coalition
- There are very few opportunities to build housing that people really need.
- This parcel provides a unique opportunity for low-income housing.
- Mixed income neighborhoods are good locations.
- Chinatown Community Neighborhood Association is a wonderful manager for affordable housing.
- This location is perfect for people to walk to various amenities.

(+) Ted Dienstfrey - Gerson Baker & Associates
- Gerson Baker and Associates is one of the many organizations who support this project.
- Almost all of the affordable housing projects that come before the Commission come with a certain amount of controversy. Yet when the projects are approved, the neighbors do not have any problems.
- He hopes that the Commission will approve this project.
(+) Keith Saggers - Transportation for a Livable City
- This is a great affordable housing project for the community that is close to public transportation.
(+) Jackie Chang and Evelyn Pang

He urges the Commission to approve this project since it is desirable and necessary to the neighborhood.
(-) Paul Utrecht - Giudani, Inc.
- The exceptions that this project is asking for are not justified by it's affordable housing character.
- Affordable housing is not bad, it's just that affordable housing should play by the rules that everyone else plays by.
- The project sponsor wants to get things that directly affect the neighbors.  Things like a rear yard variance and an exception from the parking requirements.
- Assuming that the residents will not have cars is a very serious assumption.
(+) Joel Lipsky - Housing Development Director - Mayor's Office of Housing
- He is here to respond if there are any questions regarding any issues related to the Mayor's Office of Housing.
- He supports the kind of action that the Commission is asked to take.  Low income housing is desperately needed.
