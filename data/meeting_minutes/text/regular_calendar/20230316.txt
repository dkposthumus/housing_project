2861-2899 SAN BRUNO AVENUE (AKA 90-98 WOOLSEY STREET) – east side between 
Woolsey and Wayland Streets; Lots 037 and 022 in Assessor’s Block 5457 (District 9) – 
Request for Conditional Use Authorization under Planning Code Sections 303 and 317 to 
address multiple Notices of Violation from the Planning Department and Department of 
Building Inspection by removing 20 dwelling units constructed without the benefit of a 
permit within five contiguous buildings on Lot 37 that are currently authorized for ground 
floor retail sales and service uses, second floor non-retail professional service uses, and a 
total of 10 dwelling units on the third and fourth floors (five flats per floor, across five 
buildings).  The proposal also seeks to legalize the exceedance of construction and the de 
facto demolition and modification of original approval to allow 2nd floor non-retail 
professional services and two residential flats on the third and fourth floors of the building 
at 2861 San Bruno Avenue (Lot 22). This building was originally constructed as ground 
floor commercial, and two residential townhouse units at the second, third and fourth 
floors. The proposal will restore the buildings to their original approved features, including 
various façade modifications.  As proposed, the Project (inclusive of Lots 037 and 022) 
would result in 12 dwelling units within six contiguous, four-story buildings. The Project 
also includes twelve off-street accessory parking spaces, 12 Class 1, and three Class 2 
bicycle parking spaces. Lastly, the Project also seeks to modify the method of inclusionary 
housing compliance, as described in Condition of Approval No. 10-15 from Motion No. 
18782, changing from providing one on-site affordable housing unit to payment of the in-
lieu fee. The Planning Department found that the project is exempt from the California 
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The Commission’s action constitutes the Approval 
Action for the project for the purposes of CEQA, pursuant to San Francisco Administrative 
Code section 31.04 (h).

WATERFRONT PLAN – Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report (EIR). The
Port of San Francisco’s proposed 2019 Waterfront Plan Project (2019 Plan or proposed
project) would update and amend the 1997 Waterfront Land Use Plan, which sets long-
term goals and policies to guide the use, management, and improvement of 7.5 miles of
properties owned and managed by the Port’s jurisdiction, from Fisherman’s Wharf to India
Basin. The nine goals and polices proposed by the Plan include but are not limited to
preservation and enhancement of the waterfront’s function as a maritime port, hosting a
diversity of activities and people, enhancing public access and open space along the
waterfront, the design of quality new development and preservation of the waterfront’s
historic character, strengthening the Port’s resilience to climate change impacts, and
cultivating an environmentally sustainable port to limit the impacts of climate change. The
EIR would analyze the physical environmental impacts of the proposed goals, policies, and
objectives of future waterfront improvements, and includes land use growth assumptions
determined by the San Francisco Planning Department, and the resulting physical
development that could occur under the 2019 Plan. Land use objectives proposed by the
Plan are particular to each of the five waterfront subareas: Fisherman’s Wharf, Northeast
Waterfront, South Beach, Mission Bay and the Southern Waterfront. Overall, the land use
objectives increase intensity of use, diversify uses, and enhance public access and
transportation infrastructure throughout the waterfront. The 2019 Plan requires
amendments to the general plan, planning code, and zoning map (for waterfront special
use districts), including updates to the waterfront design review procedures and creation
of the Waterfront Special Use District 4.
Note: The public hearing on the Draft EIR is closed. The public comment period for the
Draft EIR ended on April 25, 2022. Public comment will be received when the item is called
during the hearing. However, comments submitted may not be included in the Final EIR.
Preliminary Recommendation: Certify
