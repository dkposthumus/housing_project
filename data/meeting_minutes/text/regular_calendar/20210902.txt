STATE-MANDATED ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT CONTROLS [BF 210585] – Planning Code 
Amendments – Ordinance amending the Planning Code to clarify the ministerial approval 
process for certain Accessory Dwelling Units meeting certain requirements in single-family 
and multi-family buildings; affirming the Planning Department’s determination under the 
California Environmental Quality Act; making findings of consistency with the General Plan, 
and the eight priority policies of Planning Code, Section 101.1; and adopting findings of 
public necessity, convenience, and welfare under Planning Code, Section 302. 
Preliminary Recommendation:  Approve 
 
SPEAKERS: 
= Veronica Flores – Staff presentation 
 
- Brett Gladstone – Legal or policy reason for restrictions 
 
- Corey Smith – Carve outs 
 
+Linda Chapman – Advocate for ADUs 
 
- Bruce Bowen – See rapid development, public access to data 
 
- Anastasia Yovanapoulos – Rent control, affordability 
 
- Georgia Schuttish – Adding ADUs to new high-end projects may not be 
producing the outcome desired by the policy. On September 7, 2017 the 
Commission approved DRA-0551 for a new project after a Demolition of a 
sound home, but the Commission wanted the developer to create space for 
an ADU. It was to be 1200 square feet in size. Originally an Alteration, the 
project morphed into a Demo w/ major excavation after two appraisals 
reached former RH-1 exemption value. The home was last occupied prior 
to the sale in 2015. It was completed in 2021 and went on the market for 
$6.195 million. There was no mention of the ADU in the web ads. It was 
reduced to $5.795 million. And then removed from the market. ADUs in 
high end projects may just make projects more unaffordable. This is one 
project….

130 TOWNSEND STREET – northwest corner of Stanford Street; Lot 008 in Assessor’s Block 
3788 (District 6) – Request for Variance from the Zoning Administrator to address the 
Planning Code requirements for ground floor active use and streetwall requirements 
(Planning Code Sections 145.1 and 132.4(d)(1) respectively). In the Central SoMa Special Use 
District, office use is not considered an active use on the ground floor pursuant to Planning 
Code 249.78(c)(1)(B); therefore, the project requires a variance from the active use 
requirements of the Planning Code. Additionally, this project includes an entry niche on 
Stanford Street that does not comply with the streetwall requirements of the Planning Code, 
which require buildings to be built up to street- or alley-facing property line up to 65 feet in 
height in the Central SoMa SUD (Special Use District); therefore, the project requires a 
variance from the streetwall requirements of the Planning Code.

- Georgia Schuttish – Good that per the project sponsor: “This is not a spec 
project”. But most of the Noe Valley extreme Alteration projects since 2009 
with questionable or no Demolition Calculations per Section 317 were/are 
spec projects including two on this very block…both sold/selling 
entitlements. If Calcs had been adjusted per Section 317 (b) (2) (D) would 
genesis/outcome of this project been different? Currently this is: A sound,  
livable house. Relatively Affordable. Was: Extreme Alteration Will be: 
Demolition, Large SFH. Staff said in March 2009 when Section 317 Code 
Implementation Document was approved that: “We intend to return in a 
couple of months with a report on the first year of operation of Sect.317, 
and may make recommendations for adjustments of some of the threshold 
that the Code empowers you to make, particularly about the thresholds for 
Alteration projects that are Tantamount to Demolitions.” Staff never 
returned.
