Car-share requirements and guidelines-The Commission will review a draft Zoning Administrator Bulletin; consider adoption of a proposed Commission policy statement on car-share; and consider Initiation of Amendments to the Planning Code.The Commission will also hear a summary of existing car-share controls.   The draft Zoning Administrator Bulletin would establish protocols for the Departmentâs administration of car-sharing requirements, distinguish between different types of car-share spaces, and provide guidelines for the physical configuration of car-share spaces. The Commission will also consider adopting policies on car-share and development through the proposed Planning Commission Policy Resolution. The draft Commission resolution, if adopted, would establish city policy concerning new developments and car-share, specifically it would establish guidelines for the displacement of car-share spaces by new development, offer guidance to the public on situations where the Commission may establish requirements that are beyond those identified in Section 166 and announce the Commissionâs interest in exploring a citywide system for on-street car-share parking network. Pursuant to Planning Code Section 302, the Planning Commission will consider a Resolution of Intention to initiate amendments to the Planning Code that would establish new controls for car-share in Section 166.Note: the Commission will not make recommendations on the draft Ordinance at this hearing.  Instead, the Commission may set a future hearing date to consider the draft Ordinance.  For more information, please visit:  http://www.sf-planning.org/index.aspx?page=2347
Preliminary Recommendation: Approval of draft Commission Resolution to                                      establish a Commission Policy on car-share and to initiate amendments to the                                                Planning Code at a later hearing.

950 Mason Streetâ Fairmont Hotel Project-Draft Environmental Impact Report- The project site is located at 950 Mason Street (Assessorâs Block 0244, Lot 001). The proposed project includes: 1) renovation of portions of the landmark 1906 Fairmont Hotel building (City Landmark # 185), including consolidation of up to 60 hotel rooms; 2) reconfiguration of some existing hotel uses; 3) demolition of the 1961 23-story Fairmont Hotel tower above the five-story podium; and 4) construction of a new 160âunit, 26-story residential tower and five-story midrise residential component, both above a five-story podium, on the site of the existing hotel tower and podium (proposed to be demolished). The proposed project would include below-grade parking for about 350 vehicles.  The 113,400-square-foot project site is located in an RM-4 (Residential Mixed-High Density) Use District and the Nob Hill Special Use District (SUD), and in 200-E, 300-E and 320-E Height and Bulk Districts.  The proposed project would require Conditional Use (CU) authorization for height and bulk and for a Planned Unit Development (PUD) including exceptions to the 25 percent rear yard requirement, as well as require Planning Commission approval under the âLarge Tourist Hotel Conversion Ordinance,â Administrative Code 41F.3(f), among other approvals. The proposed exterior changes to the historic 1906 Fairmont Hotel building would also require a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Historic Preservation Commission. The Draft EIR found that implementation of the proposed project would result in a significant unavoidable environmental impact on cultural resources, related to demolition of the Tonga Room, which has been identified as a historic resource under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
