POTRERO POWER STATION – the area generally bounded by 22nd Street to the north, the 
San Francisco Bay to the east, 23rd Street to the south and Illinois Street to the west, in the 
southeast part of San Francisco Assessor’s Block and Lots:  4175/002; 4175/017; 4175/018 
(partial), 4232/001; 4232/006 and non-assessed Port and City and County of San Francisco 
properties (District 10) – Request for certification of Final Environmental Impact Report. 
The project would rezone the entirety of the approximately 29-acre site and establish land 
use controls for the project site through the adoption of the proposed Potrero Power 
Station Special Use District (SUD), and incorporation of design standards and guidelines in 
a proposed Design for Development document. The proposed project would involve the 
demolition of twenty structures, and retention of substantial portions of Station A (an 
individual and contributing historic resource), the Boiler Stack (a contributing historic 
resource), and possibly the Unit 3 Power Block (a contributing historic resource). The 
project would redevelop the project site into an integrated mixed-use neighborhood. The 
project would include a mixed-use development with up to approximately 2,601 dwelling 
units, 1,459,978 gross square feet (gsf) of commercial office/laboratory use, a 241,574 gsf 
hotel use (250 rooms), 50,000 gsf community facilities use, 35,000 gsf of production, 
distribution and repair use, 25,000 gsf entertainment/assembly space use, 99,464 gsf of 
commercial-retail use, 1,862 bicycle parking spaces, and 2,686 parking spaces. New 
buildings would range in height from 65 to 240 feet. The proposed project would also 
include transportation and circulation improvements, new and upgraded utilities and 
infrastructure, geotechnical improvements, and 6.9 acres of publicly accessible open 
space. The subject site is currently within a M-2 (Heavy Industrial) and PDR-1-G 
(Production, Distribution, and Repair) Zoning Districts and 40-X and 65-X Height and Bulk 
Districts.

unit exposure, open space, off-street loading, signage, and would establish review 
procedures for phase approvals and building permits for the Potrero Power Station Mixed-
