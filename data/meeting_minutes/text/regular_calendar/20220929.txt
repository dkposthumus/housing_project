HOUSING ELEMENT – Informational Presentation – The Housing Element 2022 Update of 
the General Plan is San Francisco's first housing plan centered on racial and social equity. 
This plan will express the city’s collective vision and values for the future of housing in San 
Francisco. It will also identify priorities for decision makers, guide resource allocation for 
housing programs and services, and define how and where the City should create new 
homes for San Franciscans, or those who want to call this city home. This update is due late 
2022 and it will need to accommodate the creation of 82,000 units by 2031, a target set by 
State and Regional Agencies that has been tripled compared to the city’s current targets. 
This hearing will allow SF Planning to share a brief update on the Housing Element review 
process with the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). 
SF Planning plans to publish the next draft Housing Element packet to HCD in early 
October, which will include a 7-day public review period.
