7-11 VANDEWATER STREET (AKA 9 VANDEWATER) AND 418-420 FRANCISCO STREET- a through lot between Powell and Mason Streets; Lots 009 and 019 in Assessor's Block 0041 -Requests for Variances. The proposal is to merge two assessor's lots into one single lot greater than 5,000 square feet; to demolish two existing one story commercial structures at the Vandewater Street frontage; and to construct a new four-story building with nine dwelling units over a garage.

A rear yard modification is sought under Section 134 (e) to provide a rear yard open space within an inner court. A variance is sought from dwelling unit exposure requirements, as the horizontal dimensions of the inner court do not meet the requirements for an open area as defined under Section 140 (a)(2) for dwelling unit exposure, and six of the ten units have no exposure other than this inner court.  The site is within the North Beach Neighborhood Commercial District (NCD) and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
