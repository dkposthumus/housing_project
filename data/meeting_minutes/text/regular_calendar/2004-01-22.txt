(Continued from Regular Meeting of January 8, 2004)
(+) Supervisor Matt Gonzalez
- He thanked everyone for their suggestions on strengthening this legislation.
- It is worth noting that this legislation will only impact a small group.  The existing businesses in this City (24,600); of these (20,900) or 85 percent are single location businesses.  Another 15 percent (16,680) are multiple location businesses and of these the vast majority have two locations only.  About one percent or less of businesses would be really impacted by this legislation.  This ordinance includes impact on neighborhood character, the increase of homogenization of neighborhood commercial districts, etc.
- There are some amendments he would like to address:  1) legislation is being prepared by the City Attorney that would get rid of the duplicative sections of the code related to 312 notice; 2) there would be an amendment on the findings regarding the special circumstances of hardware stores; 3) the City Attorney has offered to change the language regarding the ambiguity of the language:50 percent or more of the merchandise offered for sale.... to say:50 percent or more of in stock merchandise from a single distributor...  This would help clarify that.  4) regarding Discretionary Reviews: he was trying to give guidance on how this consideration would be taken up by staff.  The ordinance is useful because it articulates certain specific concerns to take into account.
- This ordinance is not really a one-size-fits-all that is often seen at the Board of Supervisors.
(-) Jennifer - San Francisco Soup Company

(-) Ana Shimko - Cassidy, Shimko and Dawson - Representing Safeway
- The Commission should advise the Board of Supervisor against this legislation.
- The City is not allowed to regulate competition and that is what this legislation is doing.

- Once a business is open, their permits can be overturned etc.
- The geographic information in the legislation is not clear.
(-) Nathan Nayman - Executive Director on the Committee on Jobs

- There is no consensus from the small business community.
- There seem to be other motives for trying to pass this legislation.
- There are ways that issues related to businesses can be dealt with without this legislation.
- This legislation would stop visionary entrepreneurs from establishing their headquarters in San Francisco.
(-) Patricia Breslin - Executive Director for the Golden Gate Restaurant Association.
- She urges the Commission to oppose this legislation.
- In this difficult economic time, it is not advisable to allow this type of legislation, which stops progress for small businesses and negatively impacts the economy of San Francisco.
(-) Ken Cleaveland - Building Owners and Managers of San Francisco
- One of the important things to remember is that local people, and many times, immigrants own chain stores.  This legislation is discriminatory.
- He urges the Commission to reject this legislation.
(-) Richard Ventura - Executive Director of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce
- It is very difficult for small businesses to operate in San Francisco.
- Entrepreneurs should be given the opportunity to open their businesses.
- The chamber opposes this legislation.
(+) Ed Bedard - Hayes Valley Neighborhood Association
- The association is mostly asking for neighborhood identification.
- Why do business owners want to sneak in to neighborhoods?
- Formula Retail uses really cost jobs.
- Locally owned and operated businesses will use other local businesses and provide jobs to more than just their employees.
(-) Matthew Baizer - Zao Noodle Bar
- He is strongly urging the Commission to oppose this legislation.
- Although he is not a destination business, he would like to expand to other neighborhoods.
- He receives many emails requesting that he open restaurants in other neighborhoods.
- He does use local architects, lawyers, etc.
- This legislation will only damage the progress of his business to other neighborhoods.
(-) Marilyn Amini
- There are a lot of issues that really need resolution.
- The Commission can request a continuance of 90 days.
- Seeing the level of controversy of this legislation, Supervisor Gonzalez should agree to this
- It would be to the interest of the Supervisor to grant an extension.
- The Commission should not move it forward.
(+) Peter Cohen - Hayes Valley
- He was impressed when the Commission deliberated long and hard over the Starbucks project.
- He was very impressed from by the comments of the Commissioners.
- Hayes Valley requested a prohibition to these types of uses but this would probably be an exception to the rule.
- Many residents will probably be happy with the notification requirements.

NAYES: Antonini, Bradford Bell, Boyd, W. Lee
ABSENT: Feldstein

Preliminary Recommendation:  Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project as submitted.
(Continued from Regular Meeting of November 20, 2003)
SPEAKERS:
(-) Victor Reda - Discretionary Review Requestor
- His concerns are the negative effects on his living environment, safety and quality of life.
- This proposal is a major change from the original proposal exposed at a Variance hearing.
- It is important that no resident owner was represented at any of the deliberations when the changes were made.
- As per the Residential Design Guidelines, the proposed building is not in harmony with the patterns of the surrounding buildings.  There is no respect for the pattern of building entrances.  There is no respect for rear yard patterns.  The project does not lessen the potential impact on light and air or lessen the potential impact on privacy.  Buildings should be similar in scale and roof forms should be compatible to adjacent buildings.
(-) Todd Olsen
- The street access to the subject proposal is one foot short of code requirement.
- The garage would cause a lot of traffic and major safety issue problems.
- Many of the occupants in the adjacent homes are senior citizens.
- The building will be overwhelming for the entire neighborhood.

- She urged the Commission to vote down this project.
(-) Richard McKray - EVPA
- He has lived in Eureka Valley for 35 years.

(-) Richard Kaprowski
- Although his lot is adjacent to the project site, he was never notified of this project.

- The project will also break the pattern of the back yards on the block.
- He urged the Commission to take a close look at these plans.
(-) Tom Archer
- He is opposed to the Variance and the setback.
- He is in favor of the green open space corridor that will be affected by this project.
- He feels that encroaching little by little and squeezing in this project will affect the serenity and bird life of the area.
- There are beautiful rock formations in the area that should be protected.
(-) Shana Tafilla
- There are many people who were here opposed to the project but had to leave.

- There has been already a Discretionary Review requestor that has withdrawn their request.
(+) Lisa Burke
- She lives adjacent to the proposed building.

- It has been seven months since he applied for this permit.

- He will absorb the penalty of the lost time and the cost of replacing the windows.
(+) John Lum - Project Architect
- The main reason for the Discretionary Review was for the third floor.
- The exceptional and extraordinary situation is that his client naively proceeded ahead with the proposed construction.
- He is feeling very comfortable with the current plans.
- This project is a small addition to an already approved third story.
- The reason why this project has been designated for disapproval by staff is because it would seem as if the project sponsor is being rewarded for going ahead with construction without it having approved permits.
(+) Edward Jong
- He is a neighbor of the project sponsor.
- He prefers the enclosed deck because it will be a more balanced design.
- If the deck is open, it will be a big deck on a peaked roof.  This would be contradictory to the neighborhood.

- He reviewed the architectural drawings and has seen the construction.  He supports the project.

- A three-foot setback is still necessary on the West side because there is an egress.
- He is willing to compromise although he is still concerned with the size of the building.
- If the windows were blocked off, there would be a loss of light to the two adjacent homes.  This would cause a negative impact on the livelihood of the care homes.
(+) Jeremy Paul
- There is a recordation against one of the Discretionary Review requestor's from 1987 recorded by the Property Conservation Division of the Department of Building Inspection which states that the building built in 1923, in the event that the space on the East side of the building is built upon, thereby obstructing the windows of the building, a light and air easement will be obtained, or the windows will be blocked off and the required light and air ventilation will be required for the rooms affected.
- There was a property conservation inspection of the occupancy back in the 80s and the permits are still open on bringing the building up to code.
- There are many issues that the Building Code does not permit the Commission to tread on.
- The current design proposes light wells on both sides of the property to provide reasonable accommodations to the windows that are there.
(+) Pat Buskovitch
- He is very familiar with the code requirements.
- He has never seen a building with seven windows on the property line.
- There cannot be egress windows on property lines.
- The Building Department does not want people egresssing across property lines.
- There are some fundamental issues with the adjoining property.
ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and approved the project with the following modifications:  extend the proposed lightwell on the east side to the ground floor, thereby providing light and ventilation to the bedroom windows of the adjacent property.  The extension of this lightwell is expected to block the passageway to the rear of the proposed unit, thereby eliminating any direct access to the rear rooms and the possible creation of an illegal dwelling unit at the ground floor.

Preliminary  Recommendation:  Take Discretionary Review and approve the project with modifications.
SPEAKER(S):
(name unclear)
- He does not have any objections to the project except for a light well that will be blocked.
- This would cause a negative impact to a second story window that leads to the kitchen.
- All he is asking is that the project sponsor to find a away to either preserve the two feet separation or provide us a similar size light well.
(+) Joel Yodowitz - Reuben and Alter - Representing Project Sponsor
- Rather than seeking to demolish this house, the project sponsor has decided to elevate the house, put in a garage and remodel the house.

- He displayed a photograph of the front view of the subject property and the Discretionary Review requestor's home.

- The project sponsor has tried to accommodate the Discretionary Review requestor's concerns.
(+) Jason Lakehammer - Project Architect
- He displayed photographs showing how the lightwell requested would have a huge impact on the feasibility of the project and the feasibility of keeping the existing structure. Also, it goes beyond what the Residential Design Guidelines are asking for.
(+) Maria Butcher - Project Sponsor
- It is very important to her to save this house.
- She does not want to build a monster house and neither do her neighbors.
- She asks that the Commission approve the project without a third light well.

Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Linda Todd - Discretionary Review Requestor
- She and her mother have lived at this house for about 51 years.
- She is protesting the proposed construction because it will have a detrimental impact on their living environment.
- She has no intention on moving or adding on to their house.
- If an addition is extended further than her house, they will suffer from lack of ventilation and sunlight.
- She would hope that the Commission will consider the impact they will have.
- She would request that the addition not extend further than their house.
(-) Jacqueline Phillips
- She knows the Discretionary Review requestors.
- The DR requestors will have their sunlight and view blocked by the new construction.
- One of the DR requestors is an elderly lady and she spends a lot of her time inside.  She does not drive so stepping outside of the back part of her house is the only way she gets some light and air.
(-) Frank Dawson
- He does not agree that the proposed construction will "enhance" the neighborhood.
- It will bring more congestion to the neighborhood.  The house is located near Candlestick Park so there is a lot of traffic already.
(+) Jose Gonzalez - Project Architect
- This addition does not significantly affect the DR requestors light and ventilation.
- The rear elevation was designed similar to what is designed in homes in the neighborhood.
- The project sponsors have gone through the proper permits and procedures.
- The design has been modified twice by request of the Planning Department.
- If further reductions are required, it would affect the project completely.
