approximately 750 housing units and approximately 1.15 million square feet of new 
clinical and research space, along with improvements in open spaces, circulation and 
support facilities. A Draft EIR is scheduled for publication by UCSF in June and approval will 
be sought by the UC Regents in November 2020.

Zoning Administrator, pursuant to Planning Code Section 140 to construct a one-story 
vertical addition to the existing three-story residential building within a RH-2 (Residential-
House, Two Family) Zoning District and 40-X Height and Bulk District. Two of the existing 
dwelling units face an open area of less than 25 feet in every horizontal dimension and are 
therefore legally nonconforming to the dwelling unit exposure requirement. The proposed 
vertical addition will intensify noncompliance for these two units. Therefore, a variance is 
required.
