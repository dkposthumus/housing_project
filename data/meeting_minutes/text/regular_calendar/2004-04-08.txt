Re:  Assignment of Staff Members for Environmental Review Matters
- Right now it is taking three months just to assign a staff member for an environmental review assignment.
- It is not possible to get a scoping study for a transportation analysis until staff is assigned.  Meanwhile the clock is ticking on the streamlining act.  It is becoming a huge problem that has to be solved.
