150 POWELL STREET- southeast corner of Powell Street and O'Farrell Street, Lot 22 in Assessor's Block 0327 - A request for Determination of Compliance under Section 309 of the Planning Code for two alternate, mutually exclusive uses, both of which would demolish three un-rated buildings located on the project site, construct an addition connected to the east side of the existing 150 Powell Street building, and renovate that existing building, rated as Category IV under the Planning Code. The proposed addition and renovated 150 Powell Street building would have four stories, approximately 65 feet tall, and would include retail space, and an approximately 3,600 gross square foot landscaped courtyard and lobby on the first floor.  Both alternatives require a determination of compliance with the Planning Code pursuant to Section 309, with an exception to loading requirements. No parking would be provided as part of the Project.  The subject site is within a C-3-R (Downtown Retail) District, an 80-130-F Height and Bulk District, and the Kearny-Market-Mason-Sutter Conservation District. Option (1) would provide ground floor, basement, and mezzanine retail, with the upper three stories used for up to 50 dwelling units, all uses permitted as of right. This alternative requires an additional exception under Section 309 (rear yard), and also must obtain variances from residential parking (13 spaces), dwelling unit exposure, and open space requirements, at a concurrent hearing before the Zoning Administrator. Option (2) would provide ground floor and mezzanine retail, with the upper three stories used for up to 50 units of time share condominiums, categorized as a "hotel" use under the Planning Code and requiring a Conditional Use authorization. The basement would be used as accessory spa and gymnasium space for the time-share residents.  This alternative has no parking requirements.

Don Gressman

Sarah Stocking
- This is a very good long-term strategy for preserving an area that it is so unique to San Francisco.  It is not just the historic quality of the buildings, but also the nature of the retail environment.  With better economic times, it will expand.

SEC. 249.24. Jackson Square Special Use District
In order to provide for the protection and enhancement of specialty retail and antique store uses in the Jackson Square area, there shall be established the Jackson Square Special Use District as designated on Sectional Map No. 1 Su of the Zoning Map.  The boundaries of this special use district shall be coterminous with the boundaries of the Jackson Square Historic District as established by Appendix B to Article 10 of this Code and further described in section 3 of that Appendix.  The following provisions shall apply within the Jackson Square Special Use District.
a) Purposes.  These controls are intended to protect and enhance the unique retail character of the special use district.  All decisions of the Planning Commission and Department for the establishment of ground floorand basementuse shall be guided by the following factors:
1) Continuation and enhancement of existing ground floorand basementretail uses are of critical importance to the character of the District and displacement of such uses should be discouraged;
2) Attraction and retention of similar new retail establishments that conform with the character of this District should be encourage; and
3) Uses that greatly intensify the density of employment have a negative impact on the provision of neighborhood services, traffic circulation, and limited on- and off-street parking.
b) Controls.
1) General.  The provisions of the C-2 use district as established in section 210.2 and applicable provisions of the Garmet Shop Special Use District (section 236) and the Washington-Broadway Special Use District (section 239) shall prevail except as provided in photographs 2) and 3) below.
2) Conditional Uses.  Office uses set forth in sections 219(a), (b), (c), and (d) at the ground floor are subject to conditional use authorization pursuant to section 303 of this Code, provided, however, that building lobbies, entrances, and exits to and from the basement ground floor, or upper floors, and other reasonably sized common areas at the ground floor shall be permitted without conditional use authorization.  In addition to the findings required under section 203(c) for conditional use authorization, the Commission shall make the following findings:
a) The use shall be necessary to preserve the historic resource and no other use can be demonstrated to preserve the historic resource.
b) The use shall be compatible with, and shall enhance, the unique retail character of the District.

RESOLUTION NO. 16577/16578
14.                                     (C. NIKITAS:  (415) 558- 6306)
RESIDENTIAL DEMOLITION POLICY- Consideration of revisions to the Planning Commission's Residential Demolition Policy.  This report provides an overview of current procedures for Planning Department review of residential demolition applications that do not require Conditional Use authorization. Revisions to criteria relating to specific General Plan Policies are suggested. Changes to procedures for determinations of building "soundness" are proposed. This is an informational presentation, with no action to be taken by the Planning Commission. The Commission may adopt specific policies, procedures, and criteria regarding residential demolitions at one or more future hearings, following a period of review and public comment.
SPEAKER (S):
Pat Lackey
- The most important things would be for people that work in the City, be able to afford to live in the City.
Jim Salinas
- Believes it is important to refurbish these properties.  Many are made in architectural designs that are important to San Francisco and were constructed in an era that workmanship was valued.
- By tearing down these small more affordable properties, you allow the developers to make huge profits and build units that are outside the range of the average San Franciscan.
- Please do not let profit become the motive for tearing down pieces of San Francisco, that can house families, seniors, renters--thereby keeping our families here in San Francisco rather than have them relocate to San Pablo, Pittsburgh, Vallejo, etc.
Addison Strong
- Affordability is an obvious concern for anyone who lives in San Francisco
Jeremy Paul
- The concept of demolition versus alteration is an artificial barrier.  There is no difference in process between a major alteration and a full demolition.
-
Marilu Lascari
- Housing demolition should not be made easier and there should be more regulations.
Russell Murphy
- It is hard to bring some of these old houses up to date with the structural standards in San Francisco today.
David Silverman
- Report is very thorough but it does not mention a very important feature that should be taken into account:  what is the age of the house?  This should be considered independent of the question of soundness.
- There is a suggestion in the report that increases the threshold of an upgrade cost to 75% in cases that are called owner neglect.  He has handled quite few of these cases and can tell you that there is no agreement on how to distinguish owner neglect from normal aging or construction deficiency.  This is an area that needs more analysis and consideration.
Ahmad Larizadeh
- Supports revisions to the criteria related to specific General Plan Policies.
Steve Vettel
- One of the replacement policy in the draft, one of the things you look at it is that the replacement building provides family housing--that becomes a plus.
- Others special-needs housing identified in the General Plan as high need is elderly housing and group housing for mentally disabled adults.
Daniela Kirshenbaum
- This report is a big step in the right direction
- Neighborhood character is something that we always we need to think about, and it is spelled out in this report.
- It is hard to find opportunities where demolitions have enhanced neighborhood character.
Pat Buscovich
- A lot of these buildings were built a long time ago and they are not functional today.
- We need to look at single-family homes differently than multi-family housing.
- Reports need to be done by people who do not have a financial interest, but an interest in the design so you can get an un-bias report.
Joe O'Donoghue
- In the 1960s and 1970s the rate of demolition was .3%, 1500 to 1900 units per year. Today the rate of demolition is about .4% and single family homes today are .01% to .03% of that.
Charlie Varon
-Let's be very careful when we think about demolition.  Think about the architectural heritage, historical heritage, or the cultural heritage, that we are taking away from our kids.
Hiroshi Fukuda
- We need to create a more efficient and accurate demolition system to be able to preserve our buildings and neighborhoods.
Gary Gee
- The criteria for a minimum  two-bedroom units is maybe too strict.  It does not allow flexibility.
Dick Millet
- Something has to be done.  We need to go back to 1300 sq. ft.  This will give 3 bedrooms and 2 baths and families might be able to live there, instead of these great luxury homes [where most of them can't].
Shawn Gorman
- Design is really a separate issue from demolition.  It is tied more often than not to cases coming before you as a result of a demolition occurring before the residential design can be approved.
Patricia Vaughey
- Concerned about the Commission voting on this, until after the demolition issue is settled at the Board of Supervisors.  Much of what is in this seems to be what is in front of the Board of Supervisors, and some the wording seems to be extremely controversial.
- Believes that you might be breaking CEQA by doing a policy like this and not doing it jointly with the Housing Element.
Kepa Acknowsky
- Would like to request that this type of study expand to include other zoning areas in San Francisco.
Sue Hestor
- Regarding Recommendation 13:  Someone buys a property that has a failure of maintenance from the prior owner.  That could not work, because 1) there will be collusive transactions to avoid; 2) property would be priced as a tear down.  If you want to keep the land value down so that someone who has the hope of buying a condemned building, you have to take the value for rehabbing a demolition out of that property.  You are not going to do it.
Joe Buttler
- The soundness report formula that is currently in place could be reasonably applied to the majority of buildings that are more than 50 years of age, due to the code upgrade, seismic and otherwise.  A broader context view of demolition within the neighborhood should be considered, and those parts in the master plan excluded from the summary of the demolition policy today, should be included.
Judy Berkowitz
- One of the things that she is particularly concerned about is the 2/3 of the interior demolition without notice.
Alice Barkley
- In terms of the old buildings, it mentions in the report that the environmental evaluation would hold out those buildings with architectural merit and historical significance.
Marilyn Amini
- Urged the Commission not to act on the demolition policy until you hear fully the Housing Element, and take public comment.
ACTION:Meeting held.  No action required.
