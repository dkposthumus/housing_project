ZONING MAP AMENDMENTS TO CHANGE THE HEIGHT AND BULK DESIGNATIONS FOR ASSESSOR'S BLOCK 0195 (BOUNDED BY JACKSON STREET, WASHINGTON STREET, MONTGOMERY STREET AND KEARNY STREET)-Consideration of an Ordinance amending San Francisco Planning Code by repealing Section263.1, which allows the Planning Commission to approve height up to 200 feet in the 65D-2 Height and Bulk District, and by amending the Zoning Map of the City and County of San Francisco, Sheet 1H, to change the height and bulk designation of Assessor's Block 0195, Lots 4, 5, 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16 from 65D-2 to 40-X and to change the height and bulk designations of the remaining assessor's blocks and lots within the 65D-2 Height and Bulk District from 65D-2 to 65-A, and making findings of consistency with the priority policies of Planning Code Section 101.1 and the General Plan.
Preliminary Recommendation: Approval
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Supervisor Aaron Peskin - Sponsor of Legislation
- Washington Street has historically been the dividing line between the bulk and mass of downtown and the human scale of neighborhood environment of Jackson Square and Telegraph Hill.
- These are zoning battles that took place in the late 1960's.
- In the late 1980's there was an up zoning that happened and nobody, not even people with the wisdom of Mr. Badiner, quite remember what happened, but that created the 65 D-200 which allows buildings up to 200 feet on the north side of Washington Street.
- The legislation here before the Commission is designed simply to maintain the human scale environment north of Washington Street in accordance with the built environment that exists there.
- Mr. Lord indicated that City College has indeed submitted a letter that indicates that they support the legislation and further warns that as a state institution, it is not binding upon them and any properties that they own.
- He is available for questions and hopes that the Commission will recommend it to the Board of Supervisors.
(-) Ron Lee - Chinatown Neighbors Association
- The height modification is not good for the neighborhood because it would discourage development.
- Development to improve old buildings and empty lots would increase revenue.
- This height limit would decrease property values.
(-) June Lee - Nob Hill Realty
- She read a letter from her client who is opposed to this height modification.
(-) Sun Tai Lum
- She spoke through an interpreter.
- She is opposed to the height modification.  It is not fair to the residents of the area.
(-) Dorothy Zhu
- She is opposed to the height modifications.  It is not fair and it is no good.
(-) Lawrence Lee
- He and his family own property in the area.
- The existing height laws are already in place and are fair.
- He is opposed to the height modifications.
- It is not fair to take away their development rights.
- It will also devalue the properties in the area.
(-) Mary Tam
- She owns property on Washington Street.
- This height modification is not fair.

SPEAKER(S):
(+) Debra Stein
- There are a lot of issues that have been resolved in the last four years.
- Sutro Tower is a shared facility.
- The existing operations are not before the Commission today.

- The alterations before the Commission today are minor.
- The antenna will not transmit harmful radiation.
(-) Eileen Bocken
- There are a number of diesel storage facilities at Sutro Tower already.

- She recommends that this proposal be turned down.
(-) Christine Linenbach - Twin Peaks Improvement Association
- She requested that the City Attorney explain the scope of the appeal that was taken to the California State Court of Appeals.
- The use permit clearly states that Sutro Tower is limited to one tower and one building. Currently the proposal is for two 15-foot diameter satellite dishes on top of a garage that was never part of the Conditional Use permit.  And this garage has never received authorization from the Zoning Administrator as being part of the Conditional Use.
- There are several questions of safety.  For example, why does the fuel tank have to be installed closest to residential homes and water supplies?  Why do the satellite dishes have to beon topof the garage?
- She requested that this hearing be continued so that this case can be heard before the Board of Appeals first and then before the Planning Commission.
(-) Everett Homebolt
- He is opposed to this proposal because he is concerned about the diesel facility.
- He believes that this will be a fire hazard.
- He is concerned about the flammable liquids.

- The seismic danger has not been completely discussed either.
(-) Walter Kaplan - Forest Knowles Association

- A CU authorization is required by this project.
- Staff states that this project is exempted from environmental review.
- He has provided the Commission a very important court case which deals with Planning priorities.
- The surrounding areas have hundreds of homes.
- Every addition to this project demands a separate finding.
(+) Jean Sasro - General Manager of Sutro Tower
- There are three phases to this project.
- There are representatives from all three stations here to speak.
- There was a very thorough investigation for the location of the generator and the fuel tank.
- The location is the closes to KBHK so that the lines are as close as possible.
- The satellite antennas are being located on top of the garage so that they will receive signals properly.
(+) Steve Boycons - Station Manager for KBHK-TV
- He has been in television for many years.
- They are part of the CBS team.
- They are planning to expand their coverage.
(+) Joe Balus - KNGY Owner
- He is an independent broadcaster and owner.
- His company has gone through great length to do market research and find out what is underserved.

(+) Chris Boyle - Chief Marketing Officer of The United Way
- Their partnership with CBS-5 is very important.

(+) Booker Raid

- This has been a tremendously burdensome process.
(+) Bob McCarthy
- The history of the tower is not before the Commission.

- It is important to preserve free television in the United States.
