Block 1734 (District 5) – Request for Conditional Use Authorization pursuant to Planning 
Code Sections 303 and 317, and Board File No. 201370 (Interim Zoning Controls – Large 
Residential Projects in RC, RM, and RTO Districts [2021-000694PCA]) to demolish a 
detached dwelling unit at the rear of the lot and construct two new dwelling units as part 
of a one-story vertical addition and a horizontal addition at the rear to the single-family 
dwelling at the front of the lot. The Project will result in a net increase of one dwelling unit 
on the property as part of a four-story, three-family dwelling. The Project requires 
Conditional Use Authorization pursuant to Board File No. 201370 because it does not 
provide the maximum residential density that is principally permitted and proposes to 
increase the size of a dwelling unit that is greater than 2,000 square feet. The subject 
property is located within a RM-1 (Residential, Mixed – Low Density) Zoning District and 
40-X Height and Bulk District. This action constitutes the Approval Action for the project for
