1695 25THAVENUE- west side, between Moraga and Lawton Avenues, Lot 021 in Block 1918 - Discretionary Review request, for a building permit (No. 2003.10.16.7721) to allow the construction of a third-story, vertical addition to an existing two-story, two-family dwelling.  The property is located in the RH-1 (Residential, House, Single-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation:  Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the building permit as revised.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Lina Radavero
- She has been living in this house since 1960.
- The area was very quiet.
- The addition proposed for this project will impact her life negatively by blocking her sunlight and decreasing the value of her house.
- There are various neighbors who are opposed to this project.
- The parking in the area is terrible already.
(-) Josef Brunner
- He has been living in the Sunset for 50 years.
- The Sunset district is over populated already and this project will allow more people to live there.
- His friend has to park in front of his [Josef's] driveway because there are no parking spaces available.
- The only light that the DR requestor has is not that much.  So allowing this addition will completely block her sunlight.
- He displayed photographs of the DR requestor's home.
(-) Nick Rubinsoff
- In a community such as the Sunset where the houses touch each other, any changes to a house can affect severely the adjacent house.
- Many people would not consider buying a house next to a three-story structure.
- People who buy a house in the Sunset should purchase it with the understanding that the house they are buying should suit their needs.
(-) Amy Li
- She lives close to the proposed house.
- The houses in the neighborhood are old, two-story single-family houses.
- She loves her neighborhood so she wants the houses to keep the same look.
(+) Hogum Menendez - Project Architect
- The guidelines that the Planning Department uses acknowledges the fact that corner lots are treated different than mid block lots, and that they can and should support strong architectural features in neighborhoods such as this one.
- Regarding the illegality of the unit, it actually is legal and they have submitted documentation.
- The room in the back existed before the required date for any kind of permit.  The room is not involved in any permit process.
- There is minimal sunlight impact.
- This proposal has windows that face directly to the rear, they are not oriented towards any of the neighbors.
ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and approved the project with the following modifications:  1) remove the deck and; 2) remove the decorative railing.

1380 HAMPSHIRE STREET- west side, between 25th and 26th Streets; Lot 011 in Assessor's Block 4275 -  Request for Discretionary Review and Planning Department Staff-Initiated Discretionary Review, of Building Permit Application No. 2003.07.07.8907 to construct a new one-story vertical addition and a rear horizontal addition to the existing two-story building in an RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District with a 40-X Height and Bulk Designation.
Preliminary Recommendation:  Take Discretionary Review and approve the project with modifications.
SPEAKER(S):
Re:  Continuance
Jose Obrego
- He would like a continuance mostly because he is not too familiar with the processes, technicalities, etc.
- This project was formally presented the first week of November of last year.
- The project does not take into affect the impact that he will be receiving with this project.
- He does not want to be put into the position to make decisions on such a high impact project.
Mathew Klyne
- It appears that the concern of the DR requestor is how this project will affect the foundation of the DR requestor's home.
Re:  Merits of Project
(-) Jose Obrego
- There were many questions that the DR requestor had regarding the affects of the project on her home and the financial impact.
- The DR requestor is a 75-year-old retiree.
- They support the findings and agree that this project will conserve and protect the neighborhood character.
- The Project Sponsor intends to create condominiums and this will affect the neighborhood.
- He displayed photographs of the driveway and all the issues related to it.
- He is concerned that the height of the project will completely block out light.
(-) Michael Hall
- He is the attorney for the Discretionary Review requestor.
- He was just hired last week and that is the reason to consider continuance.
- He feels that there has only been the Planner's recommendation for a few days.
- More time is needed to analyze the Planner's recommendation, the impact of shadow, the height, and other items that will negatively affect the Discretionary Review requestor's home.
- If the project is approved, it will only leave 18 feet of back yard area for a car port.
- The project is too large and too high.  It will diminish the benefit that the Discretionary Review requestor has since she has been living there for 40 years.
(-) Leo Mondragon
- He lives in the neighborhood.
- The project is very, very high and will take the light to his house and the DR requestor's home.
- Parking is very hard to find in the area and with this project it will be made worse.
(-) Andrew McAllister
- He has rented from the DR requestor for about eight years.
- Regarding the separation of the two buildings, he feels that this is the worst case of "carpet bagging" he has ever seen.
- The project sponsor is trying to separate the buildings and asking the DR requestor to pay.
- The wall where the separation of the buildings will be is in his son's room.
- The DR requestor is quite happy the way everything is.
- The Project Sponsor does not even live in the neighborhood.
- Two cars for three condos?  This is not going to be the case.  There will be at least six cars.
(-) Erika Lopez
- She lives across the street from the proposed project.
- She knows that the owner of the building where she lives has submitted a letter against the project.
- This is a great neighborhood.
(+) Mathew Klein - Project Sponsor
- He displayed photographs of the street facade proving that it is actually a three story neighborhood, contrary to what the Planner has said.
- He spoke about the architectural aspects of the project.
- The Planner has requested to have a setback yet this would be inconsistent with the Residential Design guidelines.
ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and approved the project with the following modifications:  1) reduce height by 5 feet per the Planning Department's recommendation so that the overall height of the building shall not exceed 35 feet; 2) project sponsor shall provide a matching light well to the adjacent property for the 3rdfloor addition, 3) that it be demonstrated to staff that the parking will be accessible; 4) work be conducted within the project sponsor's property line; 5) all load bearing costs as a result of this addition be born by the project sponsor.
AYES: Antonini, Bradford Bell, Boyd, Feldstein, Hughes, S. Lee, W. Lee
