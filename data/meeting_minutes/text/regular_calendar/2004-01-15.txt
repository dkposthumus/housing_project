55 NINTH STREET-Certification of a Final Environmental Impact Report:  The State Compensation Insurance Fund (SCIF) proposes to expand their San Francisco office at 1275 Market Street by constructing an adjacent 12-story, approximately 268,000 gross-square-foot (gsf) office building at 55 Ninth Street.  The project site (Assessor's Block 3701, Lot 63) is occupied by a surface parking lot with about 173 parking spaces and located mid-block on the northeastern side of Ninth Street in the block bounded by Market, Ninth, Mission, and Eighth Streets in the Mid-Market neighborhood.  The new building would be approximately 198 feet high, including mechanical penthouse, and would have a two-level below-grade parking garage with about 126 parking spaces.  The entrance to the new building and access to off-street parking and loading would be from Ninth Street.  Trucks would enter and exit on Ninth Street and could exit to Laskie Street onto Mission Street.  The project site is zoned C-3-G (Downtown General Commercial) and is within a 120-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation:  Certify the Final Environmental Impact Report.  Please note that the public review period for the Draft Environmental Impact Report ended at 5:00 pm,
