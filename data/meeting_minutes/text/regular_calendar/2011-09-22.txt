Standards for Bird-Safe Buildings- The Planning Commission will consider two items: 1) a draft policy document titled "Standards for Bird-Safe Buildings" and 2) a proposed Ordinance that would amend the Planning Code to implement the proposed policy document. The actions are intended to a) reduce building-related hazards for San Francisco’s resident and migrant bird species; b) establish consistent building standards for creating bird-safe buildings; and c) provide certain exemptions from these requirements. The proposed Ordinance would amend the Planning Code to create a new Section, 139 Bird-Safe Building Standards; and would amend other sections, including Section 145.1; and adopting findings, including environmental findings, Section 302 findings, and findings of consistency with the General Plan and priority policies of Planning Code Section 101.1.
Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with modifications of a draft Resolution recommending approval of amendments to the Planning Code and adopting a Commission policy document titled "Standards for Bird-Safe Buildings".
