(Continued from Regular Meeting of May 8, 2003)
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Jill Simpson-Rodby - Port of San Francisco - Maritime Marketing Manager
- She commended staff for a great job on this project.
- Her only concern is the designation of mixed use residential between Third and Illinois Street.
- She is concerned that if housing is allowed in that area it will be incompatible with industrial uses on port land.
- She would like to see all residential housing west of Third Street so there is a buffer between industrial zoning and housing.
(-) Mariuccia Iaconi
- She operates an educational distribution to schools and libraries.
- She is opposed to the PDR zoning of her neighborhood.
- The evolution from a raged industrial residential area to one where organizations now exist should be respected.
- Friends of Esprit Park saved Esprit park from becoming another live/work development.
(-) Drew Detsch - Friends of Esprit Park
- This was a burned out community.  The residents lived in a state of siege.
- Out of the development of Esprit Park, a community was born.
- All this was able to be done due to the M-2 zoning area.
- The new PDR zoning does not allow residential even with a conditional use.
- Flexibility is definitely necessary.
(+) Ira Maybaum - San Francisco Dry-dock
- He has been in the area since the 70s.
- His company is the only ship repair in Northern California.
- When the shipyard is working on a cruise ship, they have to work around the clock and this generates noise and light.
- Having residential use east of Third Street would be a continuing problem.
(-) Michael J. Burke - Attorney for ECOR-SF Holdings, Inc. (formerly Esprit)
- He is not in agreement with designating the area to PDR.
- PDR uses would [not] support the near term capital expenditures and long term maintenance costs necessary to preserve this historic asset.
- ECOR requests that the land use designation be changed from PDR to mixed-use residential.
(-) Kate White - Housing Action Coalition
- She believes that the best course for the Planning Commission is to direct Planning staff to reconsider objectives, policies, and land use proposals and come back with a plan that better reflects a balance of the needs of the Central Waterfront and the City as a whole.
- She would be happy to work with the Planning Department in making this a stronger plan.
(-) Oz Erickson - Emerald Fund
- His organization does not have any property interests in the Central Waterfront.
- This is a terrible plan.
- He would recommend that the Commission instruct Planning staff to start over.
(-) John M. Sanger - Counsel to RAM Development
- His clients have worked very successfully with Potrero Boosters and the Dogpatch Neighborhood Association.  They have received approval for their projects from both organizations.
- This plan has one fatal flaw.  It is perceived from a biased point of view that there must be a very [heavy] handed effort to provide an expansion of PDR uses and to protect PDR uses from new residential/commercial development.
(-) Marina Secchitano - ILWU
- She is very concerned about the potential impact for Maritime Industrial in the Port of San Francisco.
- The designation of mixed-use residential between Third and Illinois and Mariposa and 25thStreets need to be thought out and that there be a buffer zone.
- The shipyard works 24 hours [a day] and this could cause problems with residential use.  There is a lot of activity that does not need to be shared with residential use.
(+/-) Joe Boss
- He lives in the Dogpatch area.
- The planning staff should be praised for their work but the plan has failed.
- The Planning staff needs to go back and start all over.
(-) Steve Vettel
- He did not participate in the Central Waterfront Plan, but he did participate in the Neighborhood planning.
- The notion that there should not be people living around Esprit Park is not a good idea.  People need to be around the area.
- It is time to look at this from scratch and reexamine the goals.

SPEAKER(S):
(-) Sue Hestor - Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition
- The data is misleading when people say this is business services.
- This property used to be a garment factory.
- A particular tenant would create a non-office use.
- There has not been a determination from an attorney to say what creates a use.
- She is concerned that a precedent is being set where the department states that a business services is being determined even if the building was never occupied.
(-) Gene Layman
- She is the manager of a self storage near the site.
- Within the last few years there have been at least five new facilities built.
- She believes that this would be an inappropriate use for the area.
(+) Steve Atkinson - Steffel, Levit and Weiss - Representing Project Sponsor
- This project will be a self-storage use and not a business service use.
- A building permit was issued that states that the project is a conversion from industrial to business service.
- The department properly has determined that this is a business service but it does not make any difference to this Discretionary Review.
ACTION: Did not take Discretionary Review and approved the project.
AYES: Antonini, Bradford Bell, Boyd, Hughes, W. Lee
NAYES: S. Lee
ABSENT: Feldstein
H. PUBLIC COMMENT
At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public comment, the commission is limited to:
(1)  responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or
(2)  requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or
(3)  directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.  (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))

- District 2 is all about mergers, District 1 is all about demolitions, District 8 is all about demolitions and mergers.
- She is concerned about the approval of mergers.
- She is concerned about mis-statements being made and staff listening to this.
- Staff should "pipe up" when these statements are being made.
