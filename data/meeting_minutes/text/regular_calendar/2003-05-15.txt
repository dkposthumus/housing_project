CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES PROJECT-Public Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Report- The California Academy of Sciences is in Golden Gate Park (Lot 1 of Assessor's Block 1700) along the easterly edge of the Music Concourse within a P (Public Use) district and an OS (Open Space) Height and Bulk District. The project would be to build a new CAS on the site of the existing facilities. The project would include demolition of 11 of the existing 12 buildings, and the removal of approximately 73 existing parking spaces. The project would retain and rehabilitate Simson African Hall in place. The Academy would retain its general location and orientation. The new facility would include three main levels above grade, two levels below grade, and a loading area at the southwestern portion of the project site. The new Academy building would be approximately 460 feet long and 280 feet wide, with the edges of the roof extending to approximately 520 feet long by 335 feet wide. The building would feature a landscaped roof, the base height of which would be less than 40 feet. Above the base, the landscaped roof would undulate to accommodate the Academy's major programmatic components beneath, with the two peak elements over the planetarium and rainforest exhibits reaching a height of about 67 feet, or approximately 13 feet beyond the highest existing point (Morrison Planetarium). These two peaks would be set back approximately 150 feet from the roof's edge along Academy Drive. Trellised portions of the roof would extend beyond the perimeter walls. The floor area would increase from approximately 350,000 sq. ft. to approximately 390,000 sq. ft. The footprint would decrease from approximately 240,000 sq. ft. to approximately 205,500 sq. ft. This increase in area on a smaller footprint is possible because the plans significantly increase basement level areas. Note: Written comments will be received at the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m., on
