675 TOWNSEND STREET.south side between 7thand 8thStreets;  Lot 007 in Assessor Block 3799.  The project is related to Planning Case No. 1998.455C, a mixed use development of 148 dwelling units, approximately 35,000 square feet of ground floor commercial space and 256 parking spaces in two basement levels.  Due to the presence of a Caltrain easement, the originally proposed 7'-6" wide sidewalk along Townsend Street would be reduced to 4'-6" to maintain a minimum distance from an existing rail line in the Townsend Street right-of-way.  The reduced sidewalk width is less than the Department of Public Works' minimum 6-foot sidewalk width standard.  The subject property (675 Townsend Street) is in an M-2 (Heavy Industrial) District and an 40-X/50-X (Height and Bulk) District.
Preliminary Recommendation:  Find the proposal not in conformity with the General Plan
