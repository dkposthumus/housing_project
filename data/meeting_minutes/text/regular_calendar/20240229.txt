AFFORDABLE HOUSING LEADERSHIP COUNCIL RECOMMENDATIONS AND REPORT – Informational Presentation 
– The Affordable Housing Leadership Council was convened to provide recommendations to San Francisco City 
staff and policymakers on funding and financing and other strategies needed to deliver 46,000 homes affordable 
at extremely low, very low, low, and moderate incomes as called for in the housing targets of the Housing 
Element. Mayor London Breed called for the formation of the Leadership Council as part of Housing Element

academia, business and finance, and philanthropy. The Council has explored new and expanded affordable 
housing funding and financing tools as well as innovative ways for government, nonprofit, philanthropic, and 
business sectors to help build affordable housing. Their recommendations are described in detail in the 
accompanying report that was prepared by City staff and consultants.

Opportunity SUD (Special Use District), and 40-X Height and Bulk District. The Planning Department found that 
the project is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Pursuant to Chapter 31 of the San 
Francisco Administrative Code, the Environmental Review Officer determined that the proposed project, which 
was originally approved by the Board of Supervisors on November 3, 2020 (Motion M20-165), does not constitute 
a “substantial modification” as compared to the original project application upon which the CEQA exemption 
dated November 21, 2019 was based. Therefore, no additional environmental review is required.
