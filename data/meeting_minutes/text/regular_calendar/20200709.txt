552-554 HILL STREET – north side of Hill Street, between Noe and Castro Streets; Lot 065 in 
Assessor’s Block 3622 (District 8) – Request for Variance from the Zoning Administrator to 
legalize the unauthorized removal & relocation of one dwelling unit to basement level, the  
horizontal building and deck expansion on an existing two-dwelling unit building. The 
existing building is non-conforming, and the unauthorized rear building and deck 
additions encroach approximately 11 feet 4 inches into the required rear yard and result in 
a rear yard of 28 feet 6 inches.  Planning Code Section 134 requires the subject property to 
maintain a rear yard of 39 feet 10 Inches. Therefore, a rear yard variance is required. 
Planning Code Section 140 requires each dwelling unit to face on an open area meeting 
minimum dimensions. The relocated dwelling unit does not meet the minimum 
requirements. Therefore, an exposure variance is required.  Planning Code Section 135 
requires the subject project to provide 166 square feet of common usable open space for 
each dwelling unit. The relocated dwelling unit would not comply with the open space 
requirement. Therefore, an open space variance is required. The subject property is located 
within a RH-2 (Residential House, Two Family) Zoning District and 40-X Height and Bulk 
District.
