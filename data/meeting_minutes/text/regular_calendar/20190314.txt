SENATE BILL 50: PLANNING AND ZONING: HOUSING DEVELOPMENT: EQUITABLE 
COMMUNITIES INCENTIVE (2019) – Informational Item Staff will present on the proposed 
State Senate Bill 50 (“SB 50”) and its potential effects within San Francisco. This pending 
state bill would require a local government to grant an equitable communities incentive 
when a development proponent seeks to construct a qualified residential development 
that is either within a job-rich or a transit-rich area. The proposed bill provides certain 
exemptions related to housing occupied by tenants and within areas defined as sensitive 
communities. The proposed bill would require that a qualified residential development be 
eligible for certain waivers and up to 3 additional incentives or concessions.    
Preliminary Recommendation: None - Informational

- Mary Claire Amable – Not going to fix the affordable housing issue 
 
 
 
 
- David Woo – Affordable housing crisis 
 
 
 
 
- Anastasia Yovonapolous – Deregulation, moratorium 
Although SB50 extends protection to tenants by exempting buildings 
that are not or have not been tenant occupied, from qualifying for the 
program, the 635 of San Francisco residents who rent, including 14% 
renting single family homes are not protected at all, because our city 
does not have a sure way of knowing whether a building is or has been 
tenant occupied.  There is no tenant data base or registry of tenant 
occupancy. How can the city be expected to implement SB50 unless all 
the elements to ensure that tenant protections are in place? 
 
Should Senate Bill 50 pass, Commissioners, I ask that the city proclaim a 
moratorium on implementing this legislation until the city has complete 
information regarding past and present tenant occupancy.

Mayor: “More housing near Transit” “Maintain strong renter protections” 
“Demolition restrictions” “Focus…Empty Lots…Underutilized 
commercial spaces” 
• 
Transit can change/frequency  Uncertainty 
• 
“Jobs Rich” areas  Regional metric basis over local allowed 
• 
Height limits unenforceable; projects must meet minimum floor-
area-ratios (e.g.2.5 -3.25 far) – metric not applied to residential 
today 
• 
On-site inclusionary: “Affordable” unclear 
• 
Incentivize developers invoke Housing Accountability Act (HAA)  
Increased HEIGHTS/DENSITY/FARS in lower-density areas 
• 
Can’t reject additions/demolitions of units vs. “Home-SF” 
• 
SF lacks clear objective planning/building demolition criteria – 
HAA/SB-50 increase demolitions/expansions  missing 
“Demolition Restrictions”  Impact > “Underutilized spaces”/” 
Empty lots” including affordable housing 
• 
Weak tenant protection look-back w/o rental registry 
• 
“renters” = Long term  short-term rentals in new units defeats 
residents’ housing stock 
• 
55-ft height removed w/ criteria without affordable housing 
• 
SB-50 RH-1s 9 units; AB-68 <TING> carves out RH1s with new 
formula so = 3 units while RH-2/RH-3x remains 6-8+units/lot; 
RMs/NCs More
