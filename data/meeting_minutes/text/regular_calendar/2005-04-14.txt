The Zoning Administrator will hold a simultaneous hearing to consider a request for an off-street parking variance.
Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Simon Quan - Representing Project Sponsor - Project Architect
- The footprint of the building is very small.
- The fa√ßade cannot be changed because it is a historical building.
- Three other buildings are on the alley. There is concern about sharing it with this project.
- The project was split into two phases because there were still tenants occupying the building.
- The owner prefers to have the BMR units in the mezzanine level.
(+) Jeremy Nelson - Transportation for a Livable City
- They are in support of this project.
- The code should be changed to minimize parking in a CG3 zoning district.
ACTION: Hearing Held.  Item Continued to April 28, 2005 to provide new material that shows equitable distribution of BMR units and their size.  Public Comment to Remain Open.

(+) Lisa Zayas Chien - Planner at the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency
- The agency has been contemplating this area since 1994.
- They have been working with a citizen's advisory committee.
- The project area was selected in 1997.
- The project area committee consists of various neighborhood residents that have an interest in what is happening there.
- The agency has gone through a lot to listen and gather the resident's comments and issues.
- This is a very interesting project that brings together various issues.
(+) Anthony Faber - SOMA Leadership
- This initiation should be approved to get the "ball rolling" in order to see what the Commission likes and doesn't like.
(+/-) Susan Bryant
- She has met with several groups and they feel that it is a bit early for initialization.
- The community still has concerns like:  housing, more Inclusionary housing, transportation, arts, etc.
- There is a lot more community outreach that should be done.
(+/-) Jakkee Bryson
- Her question is: "What is the rush?"
- Can the arts money be used to expand the building?
(+) Sam Duke
- She pleaded with the Commission to start this now.
- This has been worked on for so long and no one is rushing.
- The PAC meets every week and the main body meets once a month.  This project should start.
(-) Robert Ingalls
- He has been living in San Francisco all his life.
- He wants to continue living here even if he has to live in substandard conditions.
(-) Bill Murphy
- He is a third generation San Franciscan living in SOMA.
- SOMA and the Tenderloin are the most negatively affected by this Mid-Market Plan.
- 35% of Inclusionary housing should be rental housing.
- Local businesses and jobs will be lost.
- Community, cultural and arts should be encouraged in the area.
- Mid-Market will be turned into a Manhattan with this proposal.
(-) Bruce Allison
- He is opposed to this proposal.  He is disabled and is currently living in SOMA.
- Most of the rooms in these buildings are vacant because people cannot afford it.
- It all started with Moscone when he displaced a lot of people.
(-) Richard Marquez
- This proposal is making SOMA into a Manhattan.
- Who lives there?  People who deserve community based services, affordability, etc.
(-) Casey Mills - Center City SRO Collaborative
- There has been a lack of community involvement with this proposal.
- The people that will be most affected were not involved in this proposal.
- Now they are forced to approve a plan that is totally against them.
- This plan will increase subsidized gentrification.
(-) April Veneracion - South of Market Community Action Network
- More can be done at Mid-Market in regards to jobs and community based services.
- She urges the Commission not to initiate this plan until further discussions have been done.

- He is one of two people that voted against this plan.
- This was not a very open process.  Most of the meetings were held at the Flood building in back rooms.
- Most of the powerful land use attorneys have developed this plan.
- It is important that there is review of all the community impacts.
(-) Carolyn Blair - SF Tree Council and the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition
- The coalition is concerned.  This will generate increased automobile traffic and be hazardous for bicycle riders.
- Market Street is the busiest bicycle corridor.
- There are existing heavily used bicycle lanes on 7thand 9thstreets.

- They oppose residential parking in areas that are rich in public transportation.
- Cars can live underground but not people.
- This plan should be amended.
(-) Jeremy Nelson - Transportation for a Livable City
