9. 2002.0497E (R. AHMADI: (415) 558-5966)
2026 LOMBARD STREET-Hearing on the Appeal of a Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration.The proposed project includes the construction of a four-story, 40-foot high, 97-room tourist hotel containing approximately 49,000 sq. ft. of hotel area and the demolition of the existing two-story, 30-room tourist hotel/motel of approximately 8,630 gross square feet (sq. ft.).  The 13,613 square-foot lot is located on the north side of Lombard Street between Fillmore and Webster Streets (Assessor's Block 0492, Lot 25) in the Marina District of San Francisco.  Vehicular and pedestrian access to the project would be from Lombard Street.  The existing hotel/motel is currently operating, and is a legal non-conforming use as it was constructed in 1955, prior to neighborhood commercial zoning controls.  The project site is in an NC-3 (Moderate-Scale Neighborhood Commercial) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.  The proposed project would be required to get Conditional Use Authorization for the hotel use from the Planning Commission under Sections 712.55, 712.11 and 712.21 of the Planning Code.

Re:  Request to continue item later in this calendar:
Brett Gladstone

- Patricia Vaughey would like to have this case continued to another hearing date.
Patricia Vaughey
- There are people here already and were here on time so they should be allowed to speak.
- Otherwise, she would rather have this case continued to another date.

- This is the first he has heard about a continuance.
- He opposes a continuance to later in the calendar, but he does support a continuance to another hearing date.
Re:  Merits of Case
(-) Steve Williams - Appellant
- They object to the Preliminary Negative Declaration because he believes it is not ready to be approved.
- This is an extremely ambitious project.
- He displayed a map that was released in November of 2002, displaying the area where the project will be constructed and how the soil in this area is in an ultra hazardous seismic area.  The map also showed the liquefaction zones.
- There will be a tracking problem from documents and/or reports produced.
(+) Brett Gladstone - Representing Project Sponsor
- The Building Department would have to provide a report on Structural Engineering issues regarding the negative affects to adjacent buildings in case there was any stress on the proposed structure.
- It is premature to draft detail-engineering drawings.
- There is no intent to do anything unusual to this project.
- There is an underpinning agreement with an adjacent neighbor.
- He is working on the same agreement with the other neighbor.
(+) Eric Cabanion - Geotechnical Consultant
- He explained the geotechnical engineering aspects of the project.
(-) John St. Cricq
- He has lived behind the project for about 60 years.
- The issue he has is that a project of this magnitude is out of character with the rest of the street.
- It is also quite a dangerous project since there will be deep excavation done.
- There are about eight or nine properties that are not in support of this project.
- He submitted a liquefaction map of the area.
- The 1989 earthquake did a lot of damage to the soil in the area.
- He recommends that the Commission speaks to Mr. Calzia of the GS Geological Group in Menlo Park to obtain more information on the soil of the proposed project.
(-) Patricia Vaughey
- There are a lot of discrepancies in this document and if she has to go to the Board of Supervisors, they will.
- She is looking for Conditions of Approval to protect the neighbors.
(-) Robert Bardell
- The main point is that a subterranean garage will be a cause for retention of water.
- There was a river that went though the project site.
- The project would negatively impact neighborhood parking and traffic.
