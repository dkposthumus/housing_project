Preliminary Recommendation:  Approval with Conditions
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Carol Bayer and Robert Bayer- Project Sponsor

- She has not had time to review the proposed changes but have multiple concerns such as moving a building that is almost 100 years old.  She is also concerned about the historical significance of the building.
- The Presidio Heights Residents Association has not had time to analyze this project.
- What would be the result of heavy construction in the area?
- There will be a lot of discomfort to the residents of the building.
- She works on the computer daily to prepare for her college teaching and the construction would be disruptive.
(+) William Pashalinsky - Project Architect
- This is like a "little sister" to the existing building.
- There will be a five-foot setback to preserve the light coming into the buildings.

- They will install very attractive plants and flowers to keep an attractive front to the building.
(-) Michael Needham
- He is opposed to the project because he feels that it will be too large.
- From the drawings that he has seen, he feels that the project will have an impact on the space atmosphere of his units.
- This project will have a negative impact on the neighborhood.
(-) Jane Cain
- She did not have any warning of this proposal.
- There was a letter that was slipped underneath her door that did not give too much information.
ACTION: Approved with the following amendment:   Allow part of the proposed lot 004 to be kept as open space for lot 003, creating an L-shaped lot.
