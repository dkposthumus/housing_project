2083 ELLIS STREET – south side between Broderick and Divisadero Streets; Lot 022 in Assessor's Block 1126 
(District 5) – Informational Presentation for the proposed  construction of a housing development project 
pursuant to Government Code Section  65913.4 (SB 423), in an area subject to Government Code Section 
65913.4(q). The project would utilize the State Density Bonus program to add a seven-story addition to the 
existing one-story single-family home, to create a total of nine residential units at 2083 Ellis Street. The project 
sponsor submitted a notice of intent to construct the project on October 7, 2024. After the hearing and upon 
completion of tribal consultation, a formal application may be submitted following the project sponsor’s review 
of any public testimony and written comments from the hearing.   
Preliminary Recommendation: None – Informational 
SPEAKERS: 
+ Mark Topetcher – Project sponsor presentation 
- Georgia Schuttish – A-rate building; Lot size compared with average lot size in 
California and other developments in San Francisco; market rate price of units; loss of 
light/livability to adjacent units. Also, how would adjacent owners/tenants learn of this 
hearing?? This project, imposed by the State without any real input from the 
community, is contrary to the statements of the current Mayor and the Mayor-elect 
that there would be seven to eight story buildings only on the “major corridors” of San 
Francisco. This has been the clearly stated to the public. Ellis Street is not a “major 
corridor”. Project located in Priority Equity Geography neighborhood. Planning Code 
Section 317 still applies to projects in these neighborhoods per Ordinance 248-23. Also
