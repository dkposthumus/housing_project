Findings that Project shadows would not adversely affect use of public open space at Guy 
Place Park, a park under the jurisdiction of or designated for acquisition by the Recreation 
and Park Commission (Planning Code Section 295). The Project proposes to demolish the 
existing five-story office building and construction of a new 42-story residential building 
reaching a height of 443’-9” tall (462’-3” including rooftop mechanical equipment) with 
approximately 3,500 square feet of ground-floor retail.  The Project would contain a mix of 
199 one-bedroom units, 144 two-bedroom units, and 49 three-bedroom units totaling 392 
dwelling units, with just over 18 percent of the total units (55 dwelling units) provided as 
affordable (Below Market Rate). The Project would provide 107 off-street vehicle parking 
spaces, 4 car-share spaces, and 3 freight loading spaces within a below-grade garage in 
addition to 184 Class 1 and 24 Class 2 bicycle parking spaces. The Project is utilizing the 
Individually-Requested State Density Bonus Program to achieve a density bonus thereby 
maximizing residential density on the Site. The subject property is located within a C-3-
