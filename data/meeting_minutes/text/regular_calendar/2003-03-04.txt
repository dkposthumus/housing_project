        Use authorization under Planning Code Section 209.6(b) to install a total 
        of 6 panel antennas, and associated equipment cabinets, as part of a wireless 
        transmission network operated by AT&T Wireless. The site is within 
        an RH-3 (House, Three-family) District and a 50-X Height and Bulk District. 
        Pursuant to the WTS Facilities Guidelines, the project is a Preference 
        1 Location Site, a public utility structure.
Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with conditions
(Continued from Regular Meeting of February 13, 
            2003)
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Bill Stephens - AT&T Wireless
- Emergency and public service providers rely on AT&T 
        Wireless for cellular service.
- There are three roof levels on this building, and 
        none of the antennas will protrude above the roofline.
- This site is necessary for the implementation of 
        service.
- The service in this area is very poor.
- There was community outreach.
(-) Todd Curtis
- He lives across the street from this location.
- He has over 100 signatures of people who are opposed 
        to the installation of these antennas.
- He would like to have this case continued until 
        after March 13, 2003 since that is the day that Supervisor Amiano's resolution 
        will be before the Commission.
- He and his family have a cell phone with AT&T 
        service and they have excellent coverage.
- He hopes that the Commission will either disapprove 
        this proposal or continue it.
(-) Julia Babiars
- She lives across the street from the proposed site.
- She is an AT&T subscriber and she has been able 
        to receive excellent service from her home and the street.
- She never received notice about the community meeting 
        and feels that many of the residents were not properly informed.
- It seems that there are a lot of other antennas 
        and that there is probably excellent service in the area.
(-) Doug Loranger - SNAFOO
- He displayed documents with specifications from 
        the cabinets that would be used by this provider.
- He would also like to have this project continued 
        so that other people could be here to oppose the project.
(+) Marcelo Pontin - Engineer
- He realizes that the Commission is not the ones 
        to require seamless coverage - the customers do. This project would enhance 
        the service.
(+) Bill Hammett - Registered Professional Engineer
- A regular part of his practice is the measurement 
        of radio transmissions for various carriers and residents of San Francisco.
- He has measured the site and has made the reports 
        that this site complies with the standards.

(Continued from Regular Meeting of February 6, 2003)
NOTE: On December 17, 2002, the Commission continued this matter 
      to February 6, 2003 in order to give project sponsors the opportunity to 
      continue to meet with the community and Discretionary Review requestors. 
      Planning Department staff will continue to review and research the project.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Lynne Srinivasan - 1stDiscretionary Review Requestor
- She and the other Discretionary Review requestors met with the project 
      sponsor and the Community Boards. They presented various ideas for design 
      changes but the project sponsor did not suggest any changes. After a few 
      hours, nothing was achieved.
- Yesterday, they (the DR requestors) provided the Commission with another 
      compromise.
- They (the DR requestors) have come up with an equitable solution and 
      all the DR requestors have compromised on this.
(-) Diane McCarney - 2ndDiscretionary Review Requestor
- She displayed diagrams of suggestions the DR requestors have made in 
      order to come to a compromise.
- This compromise is a win win situation.
- She requested that the Commission take Discretionary Review and apply 
      the changes.
(-) Pauline Shulman - 3rdDiscretionary Review Requestor
- Department reports discuss minimal information on shadow impacts.
- She displayed a diagram that showed the shadow impacts the project would 
      cause during the different seasons of the year.
- She would like the Commission to take Discretionary Review and implement 
      the changes they have requested.
(-) Gerry Meister
- She is in favor of taking Discretionary Review for this project.

- He displayed a diagram of the proposed project and mentioned that the 
      top floor of the building is a super structure.
- He is not a DR requestor yet there was an invitation for residents to 
      come to the meeting.
- There have been a lot of projects that have had compromises.
- The project sponsor has not done anything to work with the neighbors.
(-) Dave Thompson
- He lives on Diamond Street.
- He supports the position to take Discretionary Review and look at this 
      closer.
- This project will be very, very tall.
- He agrees with taking off the beams and the chimney.
(-) Dick Meister
- He lives on 28thStreet, which is just a few blocks away.
- The existing building should not have been built in the first place.
- The people who will be impacted the most are ready and eager to compromise.
(-) Cindy Reuter
- This building is entirely out of character with the neighborhood.
- If the top part of the building would be eliminated it would make the 
      building look and fit a lot better.
- Building out to the maximum of the Planning Code does not make the project 
      compatible with the neighborhood.
(+) Debra Stein - Representing Project Sponsor
- Most of the speakers seem to be concerned about a project they did not 
      like in the first place.
- There are areas of disagreement such as the aesthetics of the existing 
      house. Any kind of impacts, however small, makes it an impact.
- Project sponsors did not know of any impacts.
- She would be happy to answer any questions on the remaining alternatives.
(+) Roberta Boomer
- The Commission needs to make a decision based on facts.
- There are no substantial impacts from this project.
- She would like the Commission to approve this project and not take Discretionary 
      Review.
(+) Doland Hartman - Duncan Newburg Association
- This addition will have no negative impact on the neighbors.
- This home is a lovely addition to the neighborhood. It is sensitively 
      designed and unobtrusive.
(+) Stewart Wilson
- This process has caused a lot of agony for the project sponsor.
- He admires the style of Patrick McGrue and urges the Commission to approve 
      this project and not take Discretionary Review.
ACTION: Did not take Discretionary Review and approved the project as submitted 
      with the understanding that the new rear bathroom window will be frosted 
      and a canopy will be installed over the proposed rear center window.

STONESTOWN VILLAGE PROJECT - 3251 20THAVENUE-Public Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Report:The project site is located on the south side of Eucalyptus Drive, immediately west and northwest of the Stonestown Galleria shopping center. The proposal includes a mixed-use development comprising approximately 366,800 gross square feet (gsf) on approximately 13.7 acres primarily used as surface parking for the shopping center.  The proposed development includes both residential and neighborhood-serving retail components.  The residential component includes three five-story, 50-foot-tall apartment buildings, approximately 96,250 gsf, 71,400 gsf, and 62,350 gsf, respectively, with 202 subsurface parking spaces; and a two- to three-story, approximately 30-foot-tall senior care facility, totaling approximately 70,300 gsf, with 17 parking spaces.  The proposed retail component includes development of a 27-foot-tall, 41,600-gsf grocery market, and construction of neighborhood-serving retail spaces totaling approximately 24,900 gsf.  The project would include construction of two parking garages and reconfiguration of two surface parking lots that would contain about 1,684 total commercial parking spaces to replace 1,500 existing commercial spaces displaced by the proposed project construction, and provide 184 net new parking spaces to serve the proposed retail uses. The proposed project would also incorporate landscaping features, such as streetscape connections, landscaped walkways, interior courtyards, and open space. To implement this project, the proposed project would require a Conditional Use authorization (CU) to amend the existing Planned Unit Development (PUD) to modify allowable residential density for the apartment community and potentially modify rear yard setback requirements for both residential components. In addition, an amendment of the Zoning Map would be needed to change the height district from 40 feet to 50 feet. The 13.7-acre project site is located in the Lakeshore neighborhood within Assessor's Block 7295 and includes portions of Lots 21, 22, and 23. The site is primarily within a C-2 (Commercial Business) zoning district, and portions are within a 40-X and 65-D height and bulk districts.
Preliminary Recommendation:  Receive Comments.  No Action Required.
Note:  Written comments will be received at the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m., on March 3, 2003.
(Continued from Regular Meeting of February 13, 2003)
SPEAKER(S):
Supervisor Tony Hall
- He has submitted a letter to the Department detailing all his concerns about the completeness and accuracy of the draft EIR and hopes the Commission will each take the time to read it.
- He will touch on a few of the highlights of his comments, which are a result of his analysis of the DEIR as well as a compilation of many of the concerns he has heard raised by the neighborhood.
- Initially, the DEIR was only going to include an impact study in 3 of the 14 possible areas.  After a public scoping hearing which he sponsored last February, the scope of the Report was expanded to include 7 of the 14 possible areas.
- He thinks the DEIR should include a full discussion of why the other seven areas are not included in the DEIR.
- The most incomplete statement, and what he thinks is the biggest failing of the DEIR, is on page 60 where the DEIR says that the project will not disrupt or divide the physical arrangement of an established community, and that the project will not have a substantial impact upon the existing character of the neighborhood.
- The DEIR only defines community and character with technical planning jargon.  The real neighborhood community and the real character of the neighborhood are standing behind him at this hearing - whether or not they are opposed to the project or in support of the project.  The neighborhood is not defined by planning jargon but by the people and institutions in the area.  They are not adequately and completely defined in the DEIR.
- To be complete, the DEIR should better define what the neighborhood's community and character are.
- He thinks the DEIR, in order to be complete, needs to provide more discussion about how the increased traffic will affect pedestrian safety in the area.  The DEIR only mentions that there are three schools in the area.  It fails to include Lakeside Presbyterian Pre-School, Mercy High School, and San Francisco State, which are all within walking distance of the project.  The DEIR says there will be no impacts on pedestrian safety.  However, I think the DEIR should use a higher standard of care in evaluating whether or not there is an impact because there are so many children in the area.
- There are a number of traffic estimates in Tables 3,4, and 5 on pages 90 and 91 that appear contrary to common sense. These tables estimate that the new grocery store will only generate 149 more trips on a Saturday than on a Tuesday.  It seems to him that the vast majority of people do their grocery shopping on weekends, and the weekend number estimate should be much higher.
- The Table 7 on page 97 states that there will be a 0 short term parking demand for the 202 units.  Does this mean that the residents of the units will never have any visitors?  Table 7 also estimates that the short term demand for parking at the Senior Care facility will be the same on weekdays as it will be on weekends.
- There appears to be a conflict between Table 5 and Table 7.  Table 5 says 2,483 daily vehicle trips will go to the market.  But then Table 7 says there will only be a need for 128 parking spaces.  How do 2,483 cars fit into 128 spaces.  Granted, the 2,500 cars will be dispersed throughout the day, but that seems to be pushing the envelope by expecting no more than 128 to be there at any one time.  If each car did one hours worth of shopping and was evenly spread out throughout the day - which is really a faulty assumption, the store would have to be open 20 hours a day to fit all 2,500 cares in the 128 spaces.
- Without getting into further detail, he would like to alert the Commission to the other points he has raised in his letter:
1. The DEIR should include a complete discussion of why there are no geology/topography effects resulting from the project.
2. The DEIR should identify the eleven so-called "soft sites" in the area where other development may occur.
3. The DEIR should explain why the nearby Stonestown Apartments are lower in density and height.
4. There are four schools along Eucalyptus - not three schools as listed in the DEIR.
5. The cumulative impact of the traffic of the four schools should be looked at as a whole, not in groups.
6. There is no discussion of future expansion and growth of these nearby schools and that impact in the area.
7. There should generally be more discussion about the impact of the project on the schools, rather than the other way around, which is how I read the DEIR.
8. The pedestrian patterns of Mercy High School's students should be evaluated.
9. St. Stephen's peak passenger loading area is not between 8:30 and 9:00 as stated in the DEIR - school starts at 8:00 a.m.
10. The morning p.m. peak period on Ocean Avenue between 19thAvenue and Middlefield should be discussed.
11. What are the pedestrian volumes along Eucalyptus, and will there be an impact?
12. On what Sunday were the 113 church related parked cars observed in Lot D - on a three day weekend or a Holy Day of Obligation or on an average Sunday?
13. What kind of squeeze of parking will result in the Merced Manor neighborhood from the YMCA and church goers who currently park in the Stonestown property?
14. Is 263 vehicles for 202 units a realistic estimate of the vehicle demand in the proposed building?
15. Will people visiting the Senior facility and/or proposed units be more likely to park in Merced Manor than the Stonestown property to avoid internal Stonestown traffic?
16. What route will construction vehicles and future loading vehicles take to reach the site?  Will they be going through the neighborhood?
17. Finally, I think there needs to be further explanation of the fact that the proposed grocery store is the real cause of the resulting traffic increase as opposed to the proposed housing.
- He thinks his office has been very fair, patient, and deliberative in reviewing this project over the last 2 years.  Balancing both property rights and the varied wishes and desires of the neighborhood, he has consistently respected the process, and it is his sincere hope that the Commission and the Planning Department will follow his lead in respecting due process by responding to all of the questions and concerns raised tonight.
(+) Kate White - Director of the San Francisco Housing Action Coalition
- Stonestown village will provide a mall with much needed housing as well as neighborhood-serving retail.
- She would like to grow old in this town and the senior units are the kind of support housing that is desperately needed especially right near services and transit.  Seniors own less cars and will not have such a traffic impact.
- The project sponsor has "bent over backwards" to accommodate the neighborhood's concerns.
- This DEIR takes a very careful look at the impacts.  This project replaces a surface parking lot with a very-much needed transit oriented development.  It is perfect for this area because it is right near MUNI.  The community needs a grocery store.
- She urged the Commission to support this project.
(+) Rick Quire - Preserve Our Neighborhood
- He requested a continuance of this case because of the newsletter that gave erroneous information.
- People have been misinformed about this project.  Who knows how many people have read the newsletter and the draft DEIR.
(-) Bill Chionsini - West of Twin Peaks Central Council
- He is here on behalf of this organization and other citizens.
- He agrees with the previous speaker regarding continuing this project.
- He submitted a letter that asks to discuss certain sections of the draft DEIR.

- Noise is not covered in this document.
(-) Ron Chun - Preserve Our Neighborhood
- The neighbors are all here to respectfully request that this commercial developer answers all the questions (required) by law that should be discussed in a draft environmental impact report.
- This neighborhood approved the creation of the Stonestown mall that (that exists today), and made it the success that it is.
(-) Len Stefanelli - Preserve Our Neighborhood
- He feels that this draft EIR is incomplete.
- There is a possible landfill site in back of the Stonestown mall.
- There was a revene that has been filled in with something over a period of time.
- There has not been any testing on the soils on this site.
- He recommends that this document be reevaluated and submitted for review.
(-) Gregory Bayol - President of the Sunset School Board
- Nowhere in the draft EIR does it discuss the issue of noise during construction and how it will affect the schools in the area.
(-) Stephens Johns - Preserve Our Neighborhood
- He also spoke on the negative affects of noise during construction.
- There is no noise report in this document.  This makes it completely inadequate.
- This document is supposed to provide something that the neighborhood could look at and not have to figure things out.
(-) Richard Levino - St. Stephens Church
- The direct negative impacts of this project on the schools in the area are not addressed.
- The document also does not give correct information on traffic impacts.
- He has read other impact reports and they are very detailed where this one is not.
(-) David Dawdy - Merced Manor
- He lives one block away from the project site.
- Hydrology is not considered in the impact report.
- The good points and the bad points should be covered in the draft EIR, but they are not.
