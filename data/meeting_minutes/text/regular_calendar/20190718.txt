CALLE 24 SPECIAL AREA DESIGN GUIDELINES – parcels within NC and NCT Zoning Districts, 
generally bounded by 22nd Street to the north, San Bruno Avenue to the east, Cesar Chavez 
Street to the south, and Bartlett Street to the west. This is an Informational Presentation on 
the proposed Calle 24 Special Area Design Guidelines (SADG), which are intended to 
supplement the City’s Urban Design Guidelines and help ensure that new development 
and remodeled building facades complement existing neighborhood character and 
patterns of development. The proposed boundary for the SADGs roughly corresponds to 
the Calle 24 Special Use District (SUD), which was adopted by the City in 2017. The SUD 
created a unique set of commercial zoning regulations intended to preserve and enhance 
the unique character of the Calle 24 Latino Cultural District (established by the City in 
2014) and recognize Latino cultural heritage. The Calle 24 SADGs will further the SUD’s 
intent through guidelines that address architectural design, artwork, and other elements

610-698 BRANNAN STREET – Planning Code and Zoning Map Amendments to establish the 
2000 Marin Special Use District (SUD) (Assessor’s Parcel Block No. 4346, Lot No. 003), and to 
create additional Key Site exceptions for the Flower Mart site, located on the southern half 
of the block north of Brannan Street between 5th Street and 6th Street (Assessor’s Parcel 
Block No. 3778, Lot Nos. 001B, 002B, 004, 005, 047, and 048). The 2000 Marin SUD would 
provide a temporary location for the San Francisco Wholesale Flower Market due to the 
development of the existing Flower Mart site, located on the southern half of the block 
north of Brannan Street between 5th Street and 6th Street (610-698 Brannan Street). The 
2000 Marin Street project site is currently located within the PDR-2 (Production, 
Distribution and Repair) Zoning District and the 65-J Height and Bulk Districts. The 2000 
Marin SUD would modify specific Planning Code requirements related to demolition and 
replacement of industrial buildings, streetscape improvements, screening and 
landscaping, ground floor height standards, better roofs, shower facilities and lockers, car 
share, vehicle and bicycle parking, transportation demand management, and impact fees 
for a period of six years. The Flower Mart Planning Code text amendments would create 
additional Key Site exceptions, under Planning Code Section 329(e), to the requirements 
for ground floor transparency and fenestration, PDR floor heights, overhead obstructions, 
off-site open space, parking pricing, residential to non-residential ratio, child-care facilities, 
PDR replacement, and PDR and Community Building Space.
