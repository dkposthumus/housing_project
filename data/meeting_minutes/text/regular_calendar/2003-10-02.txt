GOLDEN GATE PARK CONCOURSE AUTHORITY PROJECTS- Portion of Lot 001 in Assessor's Block 1700 - Consideration of California Environmental Quality Act Findings and General Plan conformity of the proposed Golden Gate Park Music Concourse Projects, pursuant to Section 4.105 of the San Francisco Charter and Section 2A.53 of the San Francisco Administrative Code.  The Project includes a ground lease to the Music Concourse Community Partnership ("MCCP") of a portion of lot 001 in Assessor's Block 1700 in Golden Gate Park, located in the vicinity of the Music Concourse, primarily between the De Young Museum and the Academy of Sciences, issuance of revenue bonds to facilitate the financing and construction of an underground parking facility at the Golden Gate Park Music Concourse, as contemplated by Proposition J, approved by City voters in June 1998.  Debt service on the Bonds would be paid from revenues generated by the operation of the parking facility and MCCP's philanthropic fundraising programs.  In addition to the ground lease and financing proposal, the Golden Gate Park Concourse Authority, the Project Sponsor, is seeking the approvals necessary for the construction of a new underground parking facility and associated surface improvements in the Golden Gate Park Music Concourse and certain Transportation Implementation Plan ("TIP") Elements in Golden Gate Park.  The underground parking facility would contain approximately 800 spaces at the Music Concourse.  The Project proposes to incorporate surface transportation improvements in the Concourse area, and throughout Golden Gate Park, including removal of approximately 200 parking spaces from the Music Concourse area and a total of 800 surface parking spaces from Golden Gate Park, after construction is completed.  The underground parking facility would be generally located under the existing Tea Garden Drive and Music Concourse Drive in Golden Gate Park, directly adjacent to the New de Young Museum to the north and directly adjacent to the Academy of Science to the south, in a P (Public) District and an OS (Open Space) Height and Bulk District.
