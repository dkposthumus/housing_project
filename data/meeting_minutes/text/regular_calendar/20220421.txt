SHARED SPACES PROGRAM – Informational Presentation – On March 22, 2022, the Board 
unanimously passed an ordinance revising provisions for both the Pandemic version and 
permanent codified version of the Shared Spaces Program. Key changes include a nine-
month extension to the sunset of the Pandemic Shared Spaces Program; from June 30, 2022 
to March 30, 2023. The effective date for most design and operating regulations, along with 
associated fees and fines, are likewise delayed until March 2023.  However, the Board did 
specify that enforcement for several issues, especially access for persons with disabilities and 
for emergency responders, commence immediately; and that Departments may fine for 
those.  The Program is making equity grant opportunities to available to offset impact of 
capital changes to Shared Spaces through the remainder of the pandemic. The extension 
gives both operators and City departments more time to fine-tune curb management and 
circulation concerns across the City’s commercial corridors. 
Preliminary Recommendation: None – Informational
