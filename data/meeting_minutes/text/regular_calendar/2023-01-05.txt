ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE FRAMEWORK AND GENERAL PLAN INTRODUCTION – Staff will 
provide an Informational Presentation to the Commission on two related updates to the 
General Plan, including adoption of a new Environmental Justice Framework (“EJ 
Framework”) and an update to the General Plan Introduction (“Introduction”). The new EJ 
Framework would fulfill the City’s obligations under California Senate Bill 1000 and is 
proposed to be incorporated by reference into the Introduction. This effort represents the 
first citywide policy focused on advancing environmental justice across all City agencies. 
Community engagement on the EJ Framework has been ongoing since Fall 2020 and was 
last presented to the Commission in Fall 2021. The Department also proposes to update 
the language of the Introduction, last updated in 1996, to reflect current values and 
themes from public engagement from many recent General Plan and policy efforts, 
including the EJ Framework, Housing Element, Safety & Resilience Element, ConnectSF and 
the Department’s and Commission’s commitments and work regarding racial and social 
equity. An initiation hearing for these General Plan amendments is scheduled for
