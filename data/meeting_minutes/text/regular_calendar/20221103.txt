HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE 2022 – Informational Presentation – The Housing Element 
2022 Update of the General Plan is San Francisco's first housing plan centered on racial and 
social equity. This plan will express the city’s collective vision and values for the future of 
housing in San Francisco. It will also identify priorities for decision makers, guide resource 
allocation for housing programs and services, and define how and where the City should 
create new homes for San Franciscans, or those who want to call this city home. This 
update is due in early 2023 and it will need to accommodate the creation of 82,000 
housing units by 2031, a target set by State and Regional Agencies that has been tripled 
compared to the city’s current targets. This hearing will allow SF Planning to provide an 
overview of the Housing Element draft materials submitted for state review and posted for 
public review in October. Materials to be presented include draft policies and actions and 
supporting technical analysis. The draft materials can be found at the following link for 
review and public comment: https://www.sfhousingelement.org/october-2022-release.
