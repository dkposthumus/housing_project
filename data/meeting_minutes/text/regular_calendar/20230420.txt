Jessie Street to the south, 6th Street to the west, and 5th Street to the east on lot 045 of
Assessor’s block 3704 (District 6). The proposed project would demolish the existing
parking lot and construct a new 27-story mixed-use building approximately 274 feet tall
with three below-grade parking levels providing approximately 178 parking spaces and
freight/service loading spaces. The approximately 535,000-gross-square-foot building
would consist of approximately 495 dwelling units, 4,000 square feet of commercial retail
use on the ground floor, and 30,000 square feet of private and common open space. The
proposed project would also provide approximately 200 Class 1 bicycle spaces, 27 Class 2
bicycle parking spaces, and passenger loading zones on Stevenson Street and Jessie Street.
The proposed project would use the Individually Requested State Density Bonus Program
and provide affordable housing units onsite. The Governor's Office of Planning and
Research certified the project as an environmental leadership development project under
the Jobs and Economic Improvement through Environmental Leadership Act of 2021. The
Project Site is located within a C-3-G (Downtown General Commercial) Zoning District,
