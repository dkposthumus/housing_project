690 MARKET STREET-  north side at northeast corner of Kearny and Geary Streets, Lot 6, in Assessor's Block 311-Request for adoption of CEQA findings and a mitigated negative declaration pursuant to 1) a finding that a net new shadow impact on Union Square Park is not adverse; 2) a Determination of Compliance under Section 309 of the Planning Code to permit an eight-story vertical addition, historic façade restoration, and conversion of an existing office building to a mixed-use project for up to 64 residential dwelling units, up to 73 hotel time-share units, approximately 6,500 square feet of ground level retail space, and a sub grade parking garage (capable of accommodating up to 29 independently-accessible parking spaces and two loading spaces with the capability of accommodating up to 100 vehicles through the use of valet services and vehicle stacking), with exceptions to the Planning Code for the separation of towers requirement, residential open space requirements, publicly-accessible open space requirements, dwelling unit exposure requirements, ground-level wind currents,  independently-accessible parking, sunlight access to sidewalks, and an upper tower extension; 3) a Conditional Use application to allow a hotel in the C-3-O (Downtown, Office) Zoning District;  4) a recommendation to the Board of Supervisors for a General Plan amendment to change the height and bulk district of the existing site; 5) a recommendation to the Board of Supervisors for approval of the creation of the Downtown Housing Demonstration Special Use District encompassing and comprised of the subject property and allowing, among other items, exceptions under Section 309 for residential open space requirements, publicly-accessible open space requirements, and dwelling unit exposure; 6) recommendation to the Board of Supervisors for conditional designation as San Francisco Landmark No. 243(to be heard at a subsequent Planning Commission hearing date); and 7) recommendation to the Board of Supervisors for conditional approval of a Mills Act Contract(also to be heard at a subsequent Planning Commission hearing date); all for the subject property, which is in the C-3-O Zoning District and a 250-S Height and Bulk District.  The proposal is to:
1)  Seismically upgrade the subject 16-story office building (The Old Chronicle Building), which would include infilling a large light well at the rear of the building that is not visible from any public right-of-way;
2)  Restore the historic building façade by removing a non-historic metal, glass and marble cladding system installed in 1962 and rehabilitating/restoring/reconstructing intact, damaged and missing historic façade features;
3)  Construct an eight-story vertical addition that will result in a building height of approximately 312 feet, and a Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of approximately 19.68 if the residential floor space were to be counted toward the FAR calculation as currently required by the Planning Code (see item No. 5 below);
4)  Convert the existing office building use to a mixed-use project that would have at least 40, but up to 64 residential dwelling units, at least 49, but up to 73 hotel time-share units (for a combined total of 113 hotel and residential units), approximately 6,500 square feet of ground level retail space, replacing an existing retail bank, and creating a sub grade parking structure, that given the irregular floor plate shape and placement of support columns would yield a maximum of 29 independently-accessible parking spaces and two loading spaces on the project site with the capability of providing up to 100 valet and vehicle-stacking spaces in place of the independently-accessible spaces.  The new parking facility would be accessed through an existing sub grade garage facility at the adjacent 88 Kearny Street property, thereby not requiring a garage entrance at the ground level of the subject 690 Market Street property;
5)  In order to construct the addition; infill the light well; implement the proposed change of use; grant exceptions for residential open space, publicly-accessible open space, and dwelling unit exposure under the procedures of Section 309, a new Special Use District is proposed to change the existing height district to a 285-S Height and Bulk District (the Planning Code allows for a 10% increase in height over the height limit under certain criteria, in this case up to 313.5 feet), eliminate residential uses from Floor Area Ratio calculations, and allow said exceptions under Section 309 instead of requiring variances.  The Special Use District would also require a minimum of 15% on-site or 17% off-site Below Market Rate (BMR) units.  The Downtown Element of the General Plan must also be amended as it specifies the height and bulk districts as currently designated within the C-3 zoning districts;
6)  The Project Sponsor is proposing to meet the Below Market Rate (BMR) housing requirement by constructing the required BMR units off-site at 938 Market Street, a project that is seeking authorization concurrently with the subject application (2003.0587HXVLU);
7)  The project sponsors are seeking to avail themselves of the Mills Act, which allows local governments to grant property tax relief benefits in exchange for the guaranteed preservation of a historic property.  In order to qualify under the San Francisco Administrative Code, the property must either be designated as a San Francisco Landmark or listed separately on the National Register.  As neither condition is the case with the subject property, the project sponsor is seeking conditional San Francisco landmark status.  The proposed Landmark Designation would become final upon the completion of the proposed project consistent with the Rehabilitation Program set forth by the proposed Mills Act contract.
Preliminary Recommendation:  Adopt CEQA findings and mitigated negative declaration.

SPEAKER(S):
(+) Charles (Chuck) Bloszies - Lead Architect
- This is a real architectural treasure.  They have considered it the equivalent of raising the Titanic!
- If the original building is compared with the building with it's first addition, it is actually out of balance.
- They have tried to rectify this out-of-balance condition.
- The height of the building was kind of limited to protect shadows on Union Square and to not over shadow it's adjacent historic building.
- There will be 106 residential units and 49 fractional interest units or hotel units.
- There were a number of endorsement letters submitted as part of the packet for this project.
(+) Jay Turnbull - Page and Turnbull
- This project is of great historic significance because it contributed to the rise of newspaper journalism in the City.  It is associates with at least four prominent people:  Michael D. Young, Daniel Burnham, John Route and Willis Polk.
- It was the first skyscraper in the West.
- San Francisco's oldest trade union which was organized in the early 50s.
- It survived the 1906 earthquake, although it has been substantially upgraded since then.
-The key characteristic of this building is height.
(+) Mary G. Murphy - Farella, Braun and Martel
- Regarding 942 Market Street, which is the companion piece to the current project:
- This will be the site of the below market housing.
- 942 Market will have 11 below market rate units.
- This project will be treated and is consistent with the Code's constraints regarding Category 1 buildings.
- This building will be converted from office to residential.
(+/-) Francisco Da Costa - Environmental Justice Advocacy
- What the Commission should pay attention to is the quality of life issues.
- He commends the architects for the wonderful work and is pleased to hear the history of these wonderful buildings.
- There should be at least 25 percent of affordable housing on site and not off site.
- Stop building more units and not pay attention to the infrastructure.  The sewer system cannot pay the added burden.
- This type of project was not presented to the communities in the southeast sector.
(+) Kate White - Housing Action Coalition
- They took a look at this project and are very excited about it.
It brings many public benefits:  historic rehabilitation work, 19 percent or more will be right in the same neighborhood, the project serves as a model for high density office to residential conversions.  With so many office buildings that could be converted, there should be more of these.
- It would be good to have more residential units in downtown San Francisco so that it is not so dead on the weekends.
- Both the Bicycle Coalition and Transportation for a Livable City endorse this project.
(+) Jim Salinas - Carpenter's Union
- They are very supportive of this project because it has a great deal of historical value.
- There is much needed housing and construction jobs with this project.
