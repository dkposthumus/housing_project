SPEAKER(S):
(-) Joyce Hong - Discretionary Review Requestor
- The problem she has with this project is the design because it is quite large.
- If this project is approved, it will cause a "domino affect" in the neighborhood.
- This four-story building will destroy the character of the neighborhood.
- There are 44 homes on the block and 138 cars.  This makes a shortage of 11 spaces already on the block.  This would increase traffic and parking problems.
- The project should remain two or three stories.
(-) Suny San Pedro
- He lives on 44thAvenue.
- He is concerned about the height of the building.
- He likes to see the sun and the trees.  This project would be detrimental because it will diminish the light and cause mold on his house.

- The fourth floor is not consistent with the Residential Design Guidelines.
(-) Joanna Jaskey
- The lots are about eight to ten feet lower because of the ground.
- Any building with three living levels above a garage level would actually be five stories high.
(-) Ron Miguel
- He hopes that the Commission will accept the staff recommendation and remove the top floor.
(+) C.J. Higley - Representing Project Sponsor
- The project will add a horizontal and vertical addition.
- He respectfully disagrees with the recommendation of staff.

ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and approved the project with the following modification:  Remove 4thFloor.

REVIEW AND COMMENT ON INTERIM POLICIES AND CONTROLS FOR THE EASTERN NEIGHBORHOODS: (including eastern SOMA, Showplace Square, and the Mission).Review and commenton adopted policies and initiated draft interim controls, which were established by the Planning Commission on February 12, 2004 to set forth areas for Housing and Mixed Uses, Core PDR (Production, Distribution, and Repair), and Housing/PDR in specified Eastern Neighborhoods Community Plan Areas. This hearing will summarize prior Commission actions and provide an opportunity for the Commission to comment on Staff recommendations for potential policy amendments and modifications to initiated interim controls.
NOTE: On February 12, 2004, the Commission adopted Resolution 16726 initiating draft controls and Resolution 16727 adopting policies for portions of the Eastern Neighborhoods. On May 6, 2004, the Commission adopted Resolution 16783, which amended the boundaries of the SOMA as addressed under Resolution 16727. On March 25, 2004, Commission President Bradford Bell re-opened the consideration of initiation of interim controls for the Mission, as addressed under Resolution 16726. On June 3, 2004, without a hearing, the Commission continued the matter to July 1, 2004. On July 1, 2004, the Commission held a public hearing and continued the matter to September 2, 2004.
SPEAKER(S):
Charlie Sciamas - MAC
- It has been about four years that this issue has been discussed.
- The community planning process began because the Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition fought to initiate this.
- Until the community planning process is completed, there is a need to establish controls in the Mission District.
- The documents, which were issued recently, do not contain the issues that the community has raised.
Fernando Marti
- They support the interim controls in their prior version without the amendments.
- He displayed a map of a previous industrial report in 1999.  What is outlined is the NEMIZ.
My Do - MAC
- She supports the interim controls, which were submitted in July.
- These new controls lack community input.
- The new controls are flawed in many respects.
- Building heights are allowed that can block light and create wind tunnels.
- Without real interim controls in place, PDR would be lost on a case-by-case basis.
- She urges the Commission to adopt the interim controls that were discussed in July.
Miriam Zamora
- She works in the community fighting for the rights of the community.
- Historically there have been controls protecting the Mission District.
- How is it possible that a team of four people can completely make changes without the input of the community as well as the staff which has been working on this for the past six years.
- Every job has a process and it cannot be done like pulling something from you sleeve.
Richard Marquez

- There is staff that is not here today that have been sidelined.
Maria Lavoy
- She has been a resident of the Mission since she was three months old.
- She is concerned that a beautiful community is being dilapidated because of policies.

- She knows what it is to struggle.
- She is asking the City to take responsibility for these interim controls.
Carmen Ramirez
- She is representing all the women and the residents of the Mission.
- She asks the Commission to be human and try to understand the people that live in the community.

- It is important to have these changes.
- There are many changes going on in the community but none of these are positive.
Francisco DeCosta
- He is going to speak for the people of the area.
- The Commission can see the concrete jungle.
- If the Planning Department does not have a dialogue with the community, then something is wrong.
- Quality of life issues are not being dealt with.
- The Commission should pay attention of the voices of the community.
Robert Pender
- He has lived in his home since 1969.
- He is sure that the citizens here have lived in their home just as long or maybe even longer.

- In an area that has been shown industrial, there are 900 rental units.
- Controls are defective.
Milton Gaines
- He displayed a parcel map showing that 30 percent is now public benefit space in a 42 block area.
- Is this too low?  Is this too high?  What should the set limit be for the NEMIZ?
- The definition of PDR is faulty.
James Collins - Six Street Agenda
- Without interim controls there are no set limits on what a developer can do in their neighborhoods.
- The blue prints that Commissioners have before them is not the same as the one that they presented in July.
- Reconsider the correct blueprint.
Susan Marsh
- She lives at 17thand Mission Street.

Fred Snyder
- He pleads with the Commission to bring the community together.
- The process has been flawed since the beginning because there has not been community input.
- Part of the problem has been the contentiousness between the groups.
- It is important to bring this back and have some meaningful discussions.
Michael Burke
- He owns property at 16thand Bryant.
- In February 2004, the Commission determined that policies rather than controls would be best for the NEMIZ.
- They have sited state law which supports their contention that you cannot subject the NEMIZ to interim controls because there has not been any change in circumstances that supported previous interim controls.
- The Commission should not "tie their hands" with interim controls in the NEMIZ.  With policies the Commission will have full discretion under Discretionary Review.
Kepa Askenazy
- She requested that the Potrero Hill area be removed from this discussion because they were not properly noticed.
- She suggested that the Commission make a motion to speak specifically on the area of the Potrero/Showplace Square area.

- It is important for staff to come to the community and chat.
Toby Levine
- She has been a resident of the Mission District since 1967.
- In 1994, there was a rezoning plan that was developed for the NEMIZ.  It had community and commission support.  The problem with this plan is that there was no money for the EIR.  So the whole plan was stopped or forgotten about.
- That plan was very different than the one being proposed.  It promoted job development and job preservation.
- She believes that this plan is moving in the wrong direction.
- The maps are not right either and they need to be fixed.
Jim Meko
- Alleys are where residential population is found.
- In the existing zoning there is little protection for the alleys.
- There is now panic in the Mission with developers trying to take advantage of this interim.
- All the alleys are very important to SOMA.
Toby Levy - Architect
- She has been an architect for 20 years.
- She believes in the diversity of South of Market, it's development patter and it's uses.
- The 40 foot height limit exclusion on the alleys should not be eliminated.
- As an architect, it is really hard to face your client down when there is a real ambiguity.
- She requested that we keep the 40 foot height limit on the 40 foot wide streets.
Debra Stein - GCS Strategies
- This is an opportunity to consider the more generalized concern about how long range planning products are used.
- There is a site that the Eastern Neighborhoods has been excluding.
- The Eastern Neighborhoods is not the only long range planning that has taken too long.
Lou Blazej
- Right now there is environmental review limbo because the loss of PDR needs to be analyzed while people are still trying to define it.  This is not fair.
- Everyone has been waiting for an initial study to be published for over 14 months.  This is hurting projects and it's hurting the community.
- He welcomes Gerald Green back and offers his full support.
Theodore Brown
- He represents a development on Rincon Hill that has been in the process for over three years.
- The EIR has been held up because of long range planning.
- He thought housing was important to this City.
- Long range planning should not kill development and housing in the City.
Fiona O'Connor
- She would rather have plans than planning.
- She has had a small business for about 30 years and has been frozen in time because of interim controls.
- Small businesses need to grow instead of coming to these meetings all the time.
Lois Scott
- She is here for the Planner Chapter of Professional and Technical Engineers.
- It is an ethical tenant that Professional planners should respect the professional views of colleagues.
- There was a prior agreement with the union and the Planning Department that when there are major reassignments of work it should be done with advanced consultation and discussion with the planners involved.
- This process would have been improved if there had been open and clear communication about the intent of the Director.
- The Citywide team's professional views should have been respected.
- There is a divided department because of the handling of this situation.
Tomas Lee - Tom Amiano's Office
- It has been enlightening to listen to 2 ¬Ω hours of testimonies.
- They are concerned also that they did not get advanced notice of this situation.
- Neighborhoods need economic development and to create jobs.
- Businesses should come in with the community's interest at heart.
Sue Hestor
- The staff report gives very truncated information of the situation.
- Many developers do not want controls.
Joe Boss
- He is glad that Mr. Green is back from his fellowship and is taking care of organizing everything in his office.
- It is very important to figure out how to fix the machine to see what it can produce.
Alice Barkley
- The planning for all of the areas started in NEMIZ around 1984.
- It took until last Friday to get the motion out.  That is why staff was not able to get anything.
- Many PDR businesses are moving out.
- She suggests that you throw away everything and do some real planning.
ACTION: Hearing held.  Public comment closed.  Item continued to October 28, 2004 for policies or controls.  If policies, define boundaries and define the NEMIZ.  If controls, initiate the process.
