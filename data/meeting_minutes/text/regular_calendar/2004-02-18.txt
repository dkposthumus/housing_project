PLANNING DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSED WORK PROGRAM AND BUDGET FOR FY 2004-2005- Presentation of the San Francisco Planning Department Work Program and Budget, and consideration of approval of a draft resolution adopting the Planning Department's proposed work program and budget for fiscal year 2004-2005.
Preliminary Recommendation: Approval
SPEAKER(S):
Alexis Harte - Coordinator of the Urban Forest Council
- Council members represent full range of organizations.
- Staff member Ann Marie Rogers is vital in urban forest planning.
- 2004 will be an extremely difficult fiscal year.
- He is asking the support from the Planning Commission to request funds for this issue.
- The Urban Forest Council and the Department of the Environment are eager to work together with the Planning Department and Planning Commission.
Patricia Voughey
- She feels that the important thing is efficiency.
- There are certain planners who the public can really know when to get a hold of.
- There are a lot of ways to be efficient.
- The computer systems at the Planning Department should have the Building Department application lookup systems on their computers.  This would allow the planners to look up all the information on a certain block/lot.
- This would eliminate the public to have to call back and call back.
Lois Scott - Local 21 - Professional and Technical Engineers
- This is a very clear and understandable work program.
- The area of weakness would be on how the department is doing.
- There is not much information on how much "backlog" there is.
- To be a better performance document, the targets need a baseline.
- It would be helpful to put "percentage complete" and "percentage proposed".
- Cost recovery would be very minimal.
- She proposes to work together on the targets and develop more specific targets.
Kate White - San Francisco Housing Coalition
- She congratulated staff on putting this budget information together.
- She seconded all the comments from the Commission on obtaining funds from the general fund.
- She expressed her support and that of the coalition for this.
- There is one big hole she is very concerned about:  EIR money for the Better Neighborhoods Plans.
- These plans have a tremendous amount of community consensus.
- With all the support from the public, it is a shame if there is no money for these plans.
Terry Milmne - Bernal Heights
- He seconded what the first speaker said.
- Ms. Ann Marie Rodgers is a very important member in the Urban Forest Council.
- Planning is something that drives the whole City and all the money Planning needs should be provided as soon as possible.
- He suggested to anyone who is listening to transmit this information to the Mayor.
ACTION: Intent to Approve.  Final Language:
