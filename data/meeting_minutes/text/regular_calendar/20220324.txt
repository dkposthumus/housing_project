WATERFRONT PLAN – Review and Comment on the Draft Environmental Impact Report. The 
Port of San Francisco’s proposed 2019 Waterfront Plan Project (2019 Plan or proposed 
project) would update and amend the 1997 Waterfront Land Use Plan, which sets long-term 
goals and policies to guide the use, management, and improvement of 7.5 miles of 
properties under the Port’s jurisdiction, from Fisherman’s Wharf to India Basin. The nine 
goals and polices proposed by the Plan include but are not limited to preservation and 
enhancement of the waterfront’s function as a maritime port, hosting a diversity of activities 
and people, enhancing public access and open space along the waterfront, the design of 
quality new development and preservation of the waterfront’s historic character, 
strengthening the Port’s resilience to climate change impacts, and cultivating an 
environmentally sustainable port to limit the impacts of climate change. The EIR would 
analyze the physical environmental impacts of the proposed goals, policies, and objectives 
based on land use growth assumptions determined by the San Francisco Planning 
Department, and the resulting physical development that could occur under the 2019 Plan. 
Land use objectives proposed by the Plan are particular to each of the five waterfront 
subareas: Fisherman’s Wharf, Northeast Waterfront, South Beach, Mission Bay and the 
Southern Waterfront. Overall, the land use objectives increase intensity of use, diversify 
uses, and enhance public access and transportation infrastructure throughout the 
waterfront. The 2019 Plan requires amendments to the general plan, planning code, and 
zoning map (for waterfront special use districts), including updates the waterfront design 
review procedures and creation of the Waterfront Special Use District 4.  
NOTE: Written comments on the Draft Environmental Impact Report will be accepted at 
CPC.WaterfrontEIR@sfgov.org or at the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m. on April 25, 
2022.

1298 HOWARD STREET – northeast corner of 9th Street; Lots 198, 199, 200, 201 in Assessor’s 
Block 3728 (District 6) – Request to amend the Large Project Authorization (LPA), granted 
by Motion No. 19867, to allow additional exceptions pursuant to Planning Code Section 329 
for off street parking (Planning Code Section 151.1) and mid-block alley controls (Planning 
Code Section 270.2). The previously approved LPA allowed for the demolition of the existing 
structures, the merger of five lots and the new construction of two 45- and 55-foot tall, four- 
and five-story mixed-use buildings totaling approximately 142,500 square feet that includes 
13,850 square feet of ground floor office and or commercial retail space, and 128,650 square 
feet of residential use for 129 dwelling units. The requested exception to off-street parking 
would allow the conversion of 11 parking spaces from non-residential to residential use in 
excess of what is principally permitted by Planning Code Table 151.1. The Project would 
maintain the approved 71 off-street parking spaces. The other requested exception would 
permit the mid-block alley to be secured by gates closed at night. The project is located 
within the RCD (Regional Commercial), WMUG (WSOMA – Mixed Use–General), RED-MX 
(Residential Enclave–Mixed) Zoning Districts and 45-X and 55-X Height and Bulk Districts.
