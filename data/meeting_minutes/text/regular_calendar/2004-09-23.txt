SPEAKER(S):
(-) Lock Holmes - Representing Discretionary Review Requestor

- Parking is also an issue with this project.
- It is important to analyze the regulations.

- Through the course of the year, her representative has met with the neighbors to discuss thoroughly the project.
(+) Jeremy Nelsen - Transportation for a Livable City
- There will be two units with two independently parking spaces.

Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Madeline E. Otsea - Discretionary Review Requestor
- She and her husband purchased their property in 1959.
- The extension is out of scale, will be a visual barrier, changes the character of the neighborhood and is a clear violation of the Residential Design Guidelines.
- She recommends that the Commission direct staff to continue to work with the Project Sponsor and neighbors to come up with a design that is in compliance with the Residential Design Guidelines.
(-) Peter Winklestein - PAR
- The Richmond has wonderful mid-block open spaces.  These projects intrude in a way that changes the character.
(-) Claire Alexander
- One of the things that drew them to live in the Richmond was the wonderful open space.
- The addition has the potential to impact future buildings.
- The open space should be preserved.
- A compromise plan should reduce the floors from two to one.
(-) Jim Alexander
- He just saw the plans that were dated June of this year.
- It appears that the owner is willing to change design and he would like to continue working with him to come up with a better plan.
- He opposes the plan as currently submitted.
(+) Richard Ngo - Project Sponsor
- They applied for this project in 2002.
- None of the neighbors came to him to discuss the project.
- He has complied completely with all the requests from the Planning Department.
- He asked that the Commission not take Discretionary Review.
ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and Disapprove Project for the following reasons:
The Commission found that the existing pattern of mid-block open space on this block was unique within the Richmond District and merited preservation under the Residential Design guidelines.  The Commission further found that the proposed addition would cause a significant negative impact to the mid-block open space.The Commission found that the proposed addition was inefficient in its layout by creating a large (550 square foot) unprogrammed and unoccupied `storage' space on the ground floor and only a 240 square foot `family room' on the second floor.

Preliminary Recommendation:  Do Not Take Discretionary Review and approve the Project
SPEAKER(S):
(-) James Finnegan - Discretionary Review Requestor
- He lives adjacent to the subject property.
- If the vertical addition is allowed he will loose sunlight in various rooms of his house.
- It will cast morning shadows on his gardens and shadows to the east side yard.
- The deck will affect his privacy.
- He would like a setback of six feet.
- Forest Hill is a historic area.  A lot more can be done to bring the proposal more in conforming with neighborhood character.
(-) Joseph Barbaccia
- He has lived behind the subject property for about 35 years.
- He loves living in the Forest Hill area.
- There are still issues that need to be dealt with.
- Because 266 Magellan was built low, decreasing the available light on the east side, the house would loose intrinsic value and cast shadows.
- The Commission should take this into consideration when they come to a decision.
(-) Jacqueline Apple
- She lives on Magellan, almost directly in front of subject property.
- The Pacheco steps are known to be one of the most beautiful architectural steps in San Francisco.
- There are two homes on the block that are from the 1950s.
- The subject property is a two-story home and once it goes to three floors it will become an exceptional presence.
- It is sad that they have to come here and not be able to work things out on our own.
- Her biggest concern is that the proposed project will not be in character with the neighborhood.
(-) Timothy Murphy
- He and his wife have been living in the neighborhood for about 29 years.
- The architectural issue is the main issue for him as well.
- The project is out of conformity and out of character.
- A two-car garage is not an acceptable style for this neighborhood.
(-) Harold Wright - Chairman of the Architectural Review of Forrest Hill
- He recalls that the first set of plans were designed by an engineer and they were awful.
- He suggested that the project sponsor hire an architect.
- He had to make some suggestions even though he is not an architect but an engineer.
- One of his suggestions was to take the suggestions from the neighborhood.
- The new plans show some improvements but he knows that there could be more.
(+) Linda Wong - Project Sponsor
- Her home is a single story.   She wants to build another story because her family is getting larger.
- She was told that she could not build another story because the adjacent homes would loose value.
- After the extra floor is built, it will still be lower than the neighbors.
- She has various signatures of neighbors who are in support of her project.
(+) Andy Forrest - Project Designer
- He was brought into the project in mid May.
- He has lived in Forrest Hill for about 10 years and is aware of all the different styles of homes in the neighborhood.
- He is an engineer but has an architect in his office.
- He has been designing homes for about 25 years.
- There are 16 people who have looked at the plans and do not oppose it.
(+) Grace Shanahan
- The square footage of the house is not that big compared to the rest of the homes in the neighborhood.
- She does not understand how the Discretionary Review requestor has a problem with the sunlight since it will not impact him.
- She encouraged the Commission to approve the project and create a home for the project sponsor.
ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and approved the project with the following modifications:
1. Reduce full bath at the ground floor to a half bath.
2. Windows must be wood with a minimum three-inch reveal.
3. Incorporate a three-foot side setback from the west side property line for the addition where feasible (not to include the interior stairs or rear bedroom).
4. Reduce the size of the second floor rear deck to the minimum required for a landing.
5. Set the addition back five feet from the front building wall creating a roof deck with a loggia or trellis overhand.

The project adds two partial floors, increasing the overall building height from 20 feet to 40 feet and converts the building from two to three units within an RH-3 (Residential, House, Three-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take D R and approve the project.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Eleanor Achuck - Discretionary Review Requestor
- She and her husband purchased the property in 1978.
- They are not developers; just regular people who wanted to have something for their retirement.
- They have five units and the rent has decreased.
- It takes them five months to re-rent units that become vacant.
- They agree that the project sponsor can build the third floor.  But is the mezzanine above the third floor necessary?  This would be a luxury addition and could be deleted.
- She just asks the Commission to consider their hardship.
(-) Edward Achuck
- He is the son of the Discretionary Review requestor.
- There are several buildings that are tall.   But everything is two stories above a garage.
- The small mezzanine is totally out of character. He is fearful that if approved, it will set a precedent.
(-) Timothy Chuck
- He and his wife purchased a building in the neighborhood about 23 years ago.
- Value decreases because of the decrease in sunlight and view blockages.
- This project will decrease the value of properties in the area.
- This will affect their retirement plan and their livelihood.
- He is mostly opposed to the top mezzanine.
(+) Greg Kirkland - Project Sponsor
- He and his wife purchased this property a few years ago.  They felt they were the luckiest people in San Francisco.  They love their home and love their neighborhood.
- Their family is growing now so they want to expand their property.
- Before he did anything, he spoke to his neighbors so they could discuss issues on the project.
- He then went to the neighborhood design organization to discuss issues as well.
- He believes that the non-conformity issue is without merit.
(+) Kenneth Rua
- He is not opposed to the project.
- There is no merit to the Discretionary Review.
- If there were any issues to take Discretionary Review over it should come from the neighbor to the north because it would create shadows that would impact them.
- The project sponsor is an owner occupied tenant.
(+) Kay Chang
- She is Mr. Kirkland's neighbor to the left and to the right.
- She asks the Commission to approve the plans.  The project sponsor has gone beyond the call of duty to discuss the project with all the neighbors and is concerned with the entire neighborhood.
- This project will enhance the neighborhood.
