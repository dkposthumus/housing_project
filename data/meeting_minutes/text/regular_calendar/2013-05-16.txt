REGIONAL GROUNDWATER STORAGE AND RECOVERY PROJECT-Public Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Report.The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) is proposing a project to increase water supply reliability during dry years and in emergencies, by increasing water storage in the South Westside Groundwater Basin during wet and normal years for subsequent recapture during dry years. The proposed project consists of the construction and operation of 16 new groundwater production wells and water treatment facilities to recover the stored groundwater. Each well facility would include the construction of a groundwater production well and associated fenced enclosure or treatment building, distribution pipelines to connect the well to the existing regional water system or to the local distribution system, and overhead or underground utility connections. Most well facilities would provide disinfection and additional treatment (i.e., pH adjustment, fluoridation, and/or iron/manganese removal). In addition, the proposed project includes upgrades to the Westlake Pump Station to serve three new well facilities (Sites 2, 3, and 4), including new fluoride, chlorine, and ammonia chemical storage tanks, replaced or upgraded chemical metering pumps, a resized transformer, and up to three new booster pumps to deliver the additional water into the Daly City distribution system, all of which would be located within the existing pump station building. The SFPUC is proposing this project in coordination with its partner agencies, which include the cities of Daly City and San Bruno, and the California Water Service Company (Cal Water) in its South San Francisco service area (collectively referred to as Partner Agencies). The project includes operation of groundwater well facilities at 16 different locations in Daly City, Colma, South San Francisco, San Bruno, Millbrae, and in unincorporated San Mateo County.

CONSIDERATION OF ADOPTING AMENDMENTS TO THE GENERAL PLAN RELATED TO THE SAN FRANCISCO BICYCLE PLAN- Pursuant to San Francisco Charter Section 4.105, Planning Code § 340(d) and § 306.3,adopt amendments to the General Plan, related to the San Francisco Bicycle Plan.  The Planning Commission will consider adoption of amendments to the General Plan, including revisions to the Transportation Element and the Downtown Area Plan, any corresponding revisions to the Land Use Index of the General Plan, making environmental findings and findings of consistency with the General Plan and priority policies of Planning Code Section 101.1. These General Plan Amendments were originally recommended by the Planning Commission to the Board of Supervisors for the Board’s approval on June 25, 2009 in Resolution 17914.  On June 25, 2009 (in Resolution 17912), the Planning Commission certified an environmental impact report (EIR) prepared for the 2009 Bicycle Plan, and (in Resolution 17913), adopted findings pursuant to CEQA, including a mitigation monitoring and reporting program. On January 14, 2013, the California Court of Appeal found that the 2009 Bicycle Plan EIR complied with CEQA but that the findings adopted pursuant to the CEQA in connection with the General Plan Amendments did not adequately set forth adequately discuss several significant environmental impacts that cannot be mitigated. the reasons for rejecting as infeasible the alternatives identified in the EIR, and did not This action therefore re-adopts the previously adopted General Plan Amendments as described above, with modified environmental findings.
