450 RHODE ISLAND STREET - RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT WITH RETAIL AND 17TH AND RHODE ISLAND STREETS LEGISLATION FOR A GROCERY STORE SPECIAL USE SUBDISTRICT.Public Hearing on Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Report:  Assessor's Block 3978, Lot 1 which is approximately the whole of the block between Rhode island, Mariposa, 17th and Kansas Streets.  The proposed project consists of  two elements: the first is two ordinances introduced by the Board of Supervisors amending the San Francisco Planning Code (including Zoning Maps 8 and 8SU) to change the zoning on the block bounded by Rhode Island, 17th, Kansas and Mariposa Streets from M-1 (Light Industrial) to NC-3 (Moderate-Scale Neighborhood Commercial).  The proposed legislation would also add Section 781.10, which would create a 17th and Rhode Island Street Grocery Store Special Use Subdistrict applicable to the block described above to permit a neighborhood grocery store with beer and wine sales on that block.  The second element is a proposed development that would involve the construction of a five-story building ranging in height from 16 ½ feet to 52 ½ feet and containing about 204,800 square feet of mixed-use residential/retail space.  The project would include approximately 168 residential units, approximately 4,000 square feet of retail space, and approximately 34,500 square feet of grocery store space.  In addition, a parking garage would partially occupy three levels, providing a total of approximately 323 self-park off-street parking spaces.  The new proposed building would step-up the north slope of the Potrero Hill project site (Assessor's Block 3978, Lot 1), which is bounded by 17thStreet on the north, Rhode Island Street on the east, Mariposa Street on the south, and Kansas Street on the west.  The project site is within the M-1 (Light Industrial) zoning district and within a 40-X height/bulk district.
