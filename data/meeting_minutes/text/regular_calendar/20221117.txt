HOUSING ELEMENT 2022 UPDATE – Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report 
(EIR). The proposed project is the Housing Element 2022 Update for the San Francisco 
General Plan. The Housing Element Update consists of goals, policies, and actions to 
address existing and future housing needs, including the regional housing targets 
allocated to San Francisco for the 2023–2031 cycle. The Housing Element Update would 
also include policies designed to improve housing affordability and advance racial and 
social equity. The proposed policies and actions would guide development patterns and 
the allocation of resources to San Francisco neighborhoods. In general, the proposed 
Housing Element Update would shift an increased share of the city’s future housing

growth to transit corridors and low-density residential districts, including but not limited 
to within well-resourced areas. Well-resourced areas are the high- and highest-resource 
areas (neighborhoods) identified by the State of California as providing strong economic, 
health, and educational outcomes for its residents. The Housing Element Update does not 
include specific changes to existing land use controls (e.g., zoning) or any physical 
development (e.g., construction of housing or infrastructure). Future implementation of 
the proposed housing element update, if adopted, would lead to such actions as necessary 
to implement the proposed goals, policies, and actions and may also include the 
designation of housing sustainability districts to streamline review and approval of 
residential and mixed-use residential development. Note: The public hearing on the Draft 
EIR is closed. The public comment period for the Draft EIR ended on July 12, 2022. Public 
comment will be received when the item is called during the hearing. However, comments 
submitted may not be included in the Final EIR.
