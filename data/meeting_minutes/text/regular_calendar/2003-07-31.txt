301 MISSION STREET-  south side of Mission Street, Lots 1 and 17 in Assessor's Block 3719 - Request under Planning Code Section 309 (Review of Downtown Buildings) for Determinations of Compliance and Exceptions, including:  an exception to upper-tower bulk limits (Section 272); an exception to height limits for upper-tower extensions (Section 263.9); an exception to rear yard requirements (Section 134(d)); an exception to ground level wind current requirements (Section 148); and an exception to sunlight on public sidewalks (Section 146);  The project lies within a C-3-O (Downtown Office) District and within a 550-S/400-S Height and Bulk District. The proposed project will be constructed on a site containing three existing two-to-six story commercial structures containing approximately 100,000 square feet of office space with some ground level retail uses.  The site also contains a vacant parcel that is the former site of a 126,732 square-foot office building that was red-tagged and demolished after the Loma-Prieta earthquake.  A letter of determination dated July 8, 2002 from the Zoning Administrator determined that the development site had an office space credit of 126,732 square feet because the demolition of the red-tagged office building was involuntary on the part of the property owner.  The proposal is to demolish the existing three structures and construct an approximately 900,000 gross square-foot structure consisting of a 58-story, 605-foot tall tower on the western portion of the site, containing approximately 320 residential units, approximately 120-units of extended stay hotel rooms, and ground floor retail uses; a 43-foot tall glass-enclosed central atrium; a 9-story, 125-foot tall office structure with approximately 130,000 gross square feet of office space, with ground level retail uses on the eastern portion of the site; and an underground four-level parking garage containing approximately 351 parking spaces.
