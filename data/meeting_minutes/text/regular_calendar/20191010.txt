BETTER MARKET STREET PROJECT – A 2.2-mile-long corridor encompassing Market Street 
between Steuart Street and Octavia Boulevard and portions of the streets that intersect this 
segment of Market Street, including the entirety of Charles J. Brenham Place and Valencia 
Street between Market Street and McCoppin Street – Certification of the Final 
Environmental Impact Report (EIR). The EIR evaluated the proposed project and one project 
variant (the Western Variant). The proposed project would introduce changes to the 
roadway configuration as well as private vehicle access, traffic signals, surface transit 
(including San Francisco Municipal Railway– (Muni-) only lanes, stop spacing and service, 
stop locations, stop characteristics, a new F-Loop, and infrastructure), bicycle facilities, 
pedestrian facilities, streetscapes, commercial and passenger loading, vehicular parking, 
and utilities. The proposed project would also change traffic configurations on adjacent 
streets that intersect Market Street to both the north and the south. The Western Variant 
would be located within a portion of the same corridor as the proposed project but would 
vary in terms of proposed improvements/regulations for discrete portions of the project 
corridor. The project corridor is located within various zoning and bulk and height districts.  
Note: The public hearing on the Draft EIR is closed. The public comment period for the Draft 
EIR ended on April 15, 2019. Public comment will be received when the item is called during 
the hearing. However, comments submitted may not be included in the Final EIR.
