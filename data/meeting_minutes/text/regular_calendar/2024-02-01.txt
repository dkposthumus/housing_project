EXPANDING HOUSING CHOICE (HOUSING ELEMENT ZONING PROGRAM) – Informational Presentation on 
upcoming zoning amendments to implement the Housing Element, in accordance with state requirements. The 
zoning proposal will increase allowable heights and density to enable additional housing production in state-
designated “Housing Opportunity Areas.” The presentation will share themes from past community 
engagement, a Final Zoning Proposal map, overview of proposed Zoning Amendments and the Local Zoning 
Program, and next steps of the final proposal. 
Preliminary Recommendation: None – Informational  
SPEAKERS: 
= Lisa Chen – Staff report 
- Georgia Schuttish – Only four sites do not have existing housing along Church Street 
from 30th to 21st Street, plus two non-commercial sites: St. Paul’s Church and Theresa 
Maher Pre-K School, two are amenities make Noe Valley a Well-Resourced 
neighborhood. Church Street is lined with sound existing housing, primarily two or 
more units. Proposed codifying Flat Policy preserving Church Street Flats is 
good/necessary. “J” is the only one-car line in the City even though the route was 
extended past 30th Street to Balboa Park over 30 years ago. Over 20,000 units are 
required for low-income households. The Rezoning is not required to be completed 
until 2026. The City should take this time to protect and preserve the City’s existing 
sound viable housing stock, not only in the Priority Equity Geographies but throughout 
the City. Public also needs time to read the Financial Feasibility Study for the Rezoning.
