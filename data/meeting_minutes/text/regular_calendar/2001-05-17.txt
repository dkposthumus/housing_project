North Beach Hope IV 
    Housing Redevelopment Project (aka 500 Francisco Street)-Environmental Impact Report Certification.   Assessor's Block 
    42, Lot 1 and Assessor's Block 43, Lot 1.  The project is the demolition of 
    13 three-story buildings containing 229 units of rental public housing units 
    and child care facilities for 38 children, and construction of 14 three- to 
    four-story buildings with 360 units of affordable housing, neighborhood serving 
    ground floor retail and commercial office space, child care facilities for 
    38 children, and one level of below-grade parking in the Fisherman's Wharf 
    area.  The 360 units would include 229 units of rental public housing, and 
    131 units of rental affordable housing of which 48 would be designated for 
    senior housing.  The project would provide 404 independently accessible parking 
    spaces.  The site is approximately 200,000 square feet, bordered by Bay Street, 
    Francisco Street, Mason Street and Columbus Avenue.  The project would require 
    a Conditional Use Authorization from the Planning Commission to permit planned 
    unit development under Sections 303 and 304 of the Planning Code.

    West Portal Neighborhood Commercial District and 26-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary 
    Recommendation: Approval with conditions
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Robert McCarthy – McCarthy & Swartz - representing Charles 
    Swabb
- In 1997 Charles Schwab opened an office in the West Portal area.
- They have received over 1,200 signatures in support of this project.
- They are in complete conformity of the zoning requirements for this 
    proposal.
- The need to expand is because there are more and more customers who 
    are requesting the services of the brokers and provide confidential services 
    to these clients.  Currently brokers are meeting with clients in open cubicles.
- There is also an overwhelming support of merchants in the neighborhood.
- There are about 30 or more people here in support of this project.
(+) Art Belingson
- A few months a go they opposed the expansion of Charles Schwab.  
    For a few years, they have been good neighbors.
- They provided money to their street cleaning.
- In the last 5 years, West Portal has increased its commercial retail 
    spaces.  This gives vibrancy to the neighborhood.
- West Portal is very unique.  The neighbors are not closed-minded.
(+) Fred J. Martin Jr.
- He knows how hard the Commission works.
- He lives on the same block where Charles Schwab wants to expand.
- He believes that Schwab needs the extra space.
- Financial institutions are regular hour servicing organizations.
- He thinks that Schwab adds to their neighborhood.  He tries to do 
    everything on West Portal so that he doesn't have to get into his car.
(+) Marie Lee
- She is a residence of Ingleside Terrace.
- She supports the expansion of Charles Schwab.
- She remembers when her husband was very happy when Charles Schwab 
    would be moving into the neighborhood.
- Having Charles Schwab present in this community has helped many people 
    with their financial needs.
- Charles Schwab is very conveniently located and has convenient hours 
    as well.
- She has been a client of Charles Schwab for many years.  Their staff 
    has always been very courteous and helpful.
(+) Terry Durkan
- He displayed a diagram of how the cubicles are very open and not 
    very confidential for clients.
- The expansion would provide office space so clients would be able 
    to have privacy.
(+) (name unclear)
- Since opening their office in this area, they have improved their 
    services to the community.
- The needs of their customers have changed.  Their financial needs 
    have become complex and detailed.
- The size of their current space prohibits them from providing the 
    best confidential financial service.
- When they first leased the space, they did not have the need to increase 
    their staff.
- He asks that the Commission approve their request for expansion.
- Their customers patronize other businesses in the West Portal area.
(+) Suki Lee – Branch Manager of Charles Schwab
- She supports the expansion of their office.
- Their expansion plan is very well received by the neighborhood.
- They have received over 1,200 signatures of customers and businesses 
    who support their expansion.
- They have serviced over 36,000 customers.  They did a random survey 
    and 96% indicated that they frequent other merchants while visiting Charles 
    Schwab.
- She hopes that the Commission will support this proposal.
(+) Victoria Minas
- She has been working in West Portal for about 13 years as a hairdresser.
- She has her own financial problems so she is a Charles Schwab customer.  
    When she goes to this office she feels self-conscious about speaking about 
    her financial problems and having other people listen.
- There are a lot of elderly people living in the West Portal area 
    who can visit this office and not have to travel all the way downtown.
(+) Jeffrey Eng
- Their neighborhood association borders the West Portal neighborhood.
- Their members frequent the West Portal Avenue shops.
- He is here to speak as an individual and to speak as a West Portal 
    employee.
- His organization is frequently analyzing projects in his neighborhood 
    and they always look to approving projects that will benefit the neighborhood.  
    The expansion of Charles Schwab is definitely a benefit to the neighborhood.
- He has worked at Charles Schwab for 3 years and has been very happy 
    working there.
(-) Mathew Rogers – Papenhausen Hardware
- He owns two businesses in this neighborhood.
- His opposition is not about Charles Schwab.  It is about the process 
    and how this came about.
- Ms. Lee contacted the West Portal Business Association about the 
    expansion.  There wasn't any community meetings or input about this expansion.
- A community room can be built in the space where Charles Schwab wants 
    to use but they were never given a chance to suggest it.
- Charles Schwab needs to expand but a more creative way needs to be 
    developed.
- Expanding behind the current location would not loose any space that 
    could be used for something else.
(-) Kathryn Claitor
- She owns Shaws Candy Store
- She is concerned about the loss of retail space.  She feels that 
    there should be some compromise.
- She has a lot of people who are interested in the vacant retail space.
- Weekend hours are her busiest days.
(-) Ray Doyle
- She is opposed to the project.  She agrees with what the previous 
    speakers have said.
- She attended a West Portal Association meeting on December 2, 1999.  
    Brian Buckner did come and mentioned he was interested in locating on West 
    Portal Avenue.  He was told by one of the members of the association that 
    Schwab had the locale and it was not available for anyone else.
- Although she is not against Schwab, she would rather see a retail 
    storefront there.
- She doesn't agree with a store that is closed on Sunday and half 
    day on Saturday.
- The first floor of this locale should be vibrant; they should just 
    move the offices on the second floor if they want privacy.
(-) 
    Bud Wilson – Greater West Portal Association
- He would like to regress here for a second.
- Reference has been made here to the number of vacancies on West Portal.
- He remembers coming to the Commission within the last eight years, 
    there was 13 vacancies on West Portal.
- The neighborhood district controls have worked well to preserve and 
    protect the street and the retail small business community.  Now they are 
    here trying to defend another small business location.

    STREET-south side between 11th and 12th Avenues, Lot 043 in Assessor’s 
    Block 1371.  Request for Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application 
    No. 2000/09/07/9909 proposing to extend the rear of the building and to construct 
    two additional floors to the existing building (one-story over garage).  A 
    second story deck is also proposed within the required rear yard as permitted 
    by the Planning Code.  The proposed alteration occurs within the permitted 
    building envelope in an RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District and 
    a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation:  Take Discretionary Review and disapprove 
    the project.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Tracy Thompson – DR Requestor
-She lives next door 
    to the proposed expansion.
- She received a letter and voice mail message from the project sponsor 
    who wanted to request a continuance and meet with her to come to a compromise.
- She would support a continuance and welcome a dialog but hoped that 
    there was enough time to review the revised plans.
- A letter was sent to the Commission requesting a continuance.
- She would like to request that this hearing be continued in order 
    to review the revised plans and perhaps come to an agreement and/or resolution.
-The 4thfloor is definitely 
    an issue.  Although there are other issues:  1) the effect that the 4thstory structure would have on the trio of post 1906 cottages, 2) the affect 
    on rear yards of the neighbors; and 3) the affect of her light and air blockage.
- Apart from San Francisco Heritage she has support from the Richmond 
    District Association and Richmond Community Association.  Every neighbor who 
    is in the immediate vicinity is opposing the project.  The appropriate way 
    to proceed would be to see the plans and if there are no further issues to 
    come to an agreement.
(-) Barbara Gault
- She lives on 12thAvenue and her house shares a back yard 
    with the proposed construction.
- She is blessed with a beautiful view and a wonderful garden.
- These gardens create a wonderful oasis which many neighbors treasure.
- She will be commenting about the 2ndset of plans that 
    were developed.
- Her lot is smaller than most lots and the proposed deck will come 
    out close to her yard and create a privacy problem.
- The construction will significantly create a problem to her light 
    and air.
(-) Bill Sugaya - Architect
- He was hired by the DR requestor to review the plans of the proposal.
- He served as president of the Landmarks Board many years ago.
- The changes made to the current plans do not deal with the historical 
    significance of the building and the height of the building.
- The issue of compatibility should be taken into account.
- The proposed project is supposed to be reduced in size.
(-) Susie Eng
- She lives on Lake Street.
- She has lived at this house for more than 25 years.  She has seen 
    many remodels to their homes.  None of the projects have been out of scale 
    to the guidelines of the neighborhood.
- The interesting design of these cottages gives the neighborhood a 
    distinctive look.
- The proposed construction would take away a lot of the charm of the 
    neighborhood.
- She would like the plans to be reduced by one floor.
(-) Racher Meyer
- It is really important for her and her family to be able to see the 
    green of the yards in her neighborhood.
- Privacy and mid-open space are issues to her.
(-) Chuck Lantz
- When he first saw the plans for this house, he determined that this 
    is a monster home.
- He wouldn't even consider constructing something like this.
- He feels that someone is going to move in and then move out.
- He hopes that the Commission gives the neighbors time to talk to 
    the developer.
(-) Vince Meyer
- He lives on Lake Street; he has lived there since 1975.
- He feels that he has been lead negatively about this project.
- A large portion of the house will be demolished so he doesn't understand 
    why it's not considered a demolition.
- There will be loss of lighting and character of the neighborhood, 
    and loss of time for coming to this hearing.
- The decks will definitely be a problem to their privacy.
(-) Laura Patterson
- She hates speaking in front of this many people but this is how strongly 
    she feels about this.
- She feels that there is a general misconception that there is one 
    large house after another all the way from Arguello Boulevard to Sea Cliff.
- One would find a pleasant mixed residential street with amenities 
    not often found on larger streets.
- The larger buildings closer to Park Presidio Boulevard are typically 
    six to eight unit apartment buildings with some smaller single-family houses.
- The block where her family lives, between 11thand 12thAvenues, is anchored with such apartment buildings.
- She believes that this project is inappropriate for the site and 
    will be detrimental to the block.
- She is concerned that the project will block her sunlight and will 
    have to deal with the construction, the porta potty and construction vehicles 
    taking over parking spaces.
(-) Deborah Jenkins
- She has been a resident of San Francisco for 10 years.  She 
    lives on Sacramento Street but walks often on Lake Street.
- One of the unique things of Lake Street are the cottages on that 
    block.
- Allowing a monster home to replace a little cottage will begin to 
    destroy the uniqueness of the homes in San Francisco.
(-) Eugenia Perez
- She lives on 12thAvenue.  The back yard of the proposed 
    site comes to the side of her property.
- She wrote a letter, which she submitted, to the Commission expressing 
    her opposition to the project.
- She has a very small yard.
- She has a lot of privacy in her yard but with the proposed construction 
    she will lose that.
- A 4-story building or a 3-story building will give her the impression 
    that she is standing next to an elevator shaft.
- Her oasis will be in full view of a 4thor 3rdfloor view.
- She requests that the Commission not approve projects that demand 
    so much space.
(-) Michael Paulson
- He lives on Lake Street and has lived there for 25 years.
- This neighborhood is open and light.  One can walk down streets in 
    San Francisco and see lot after lot.
- This project will become the biggest house on the block.  It will 
    be bigger than the flats.  It will be bigger than the small apartment building 
    at the other end.
(-) Hiroshi Fukuda
- He is a pharmacist and is a long term resident of the Richmond 
    District.
- He purchased his house in the early 1970s.
- There was a meeting held in the neighborhood where all the neighbors 
    who attended were very cordial and pleasant.  He was very surprised because 
    when he saw the plans, they shocked him because it was so large.  He assumed 
    that the project sponsor had a very large family or a very large extended 
    family, but he did not.
(-) Helen Lantz
- She wishes the Commissioners can come to Lake Street and get an idea 
    of what the neighborhood is really like.
- There are 3 people who live on a 2ndstory flat.
- The proposed construction will create an impact on the light and 
    air of her neighbors.
- It is not in the context of the neighborhood.
(-) Blake Hallanan
- She lives on 12thAvenue
- If the Commission approves this project, it will send a message to 
    developers to build bigger.
- She urges the Commission not to approve the project.
(+) Ana Dirkising
- She submitted new plans to the Commission, which eliminate the 4thStory.
- She and her husband have two children and live a few blocks away 
    from the proposed construction, which they will be living in.
- They are willing to talk to the department and eliminate the 4thfloor.
- They have looked at other places for a home.  They love the neighborhood 
    so much and would like to continue living there.
- From her property line, her house already has a setback.
- She displayed a diagram of the block and lots.  There are many houses 
    that have large lot sizes.
- She is willing to eliminate the 4thfloor if that is what 
    the Commission requires.
ACTION:           Take DR and approve project with the following amendments:  
    1) remove 4thfloor; 2) new design should be reviewed and approved

    029 in Assessor's Block 5625 -- Request for Discretionary Review of Building 
    Permit Application No. 2001/01/24/0487, proposing to remodel the interior 
    space and extend the rear of the building to the minimum rear yard setback 
    in a RH-1 (Residential, House, One-Family) District and a 40-X Height and 
    Bulk District.
Preliminary 
    Recommendation:  Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project 
    as proposed.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Brian Dare – DR Requestor
- He owns 
    the property adjacent to the proposed project.
- He apologizes if his DR review application is not as professional 
    and comprehensive as the Commission is accustomed to.
- The architect sent the final plans for this project to him on the 
    very last day of the notification expiration date.  He was given only one 
    business day to review the plans and file a DR.
- He has had to stand in long lines at the Planning Department and 
    at City Hall on the last day trying to express his concerns about this proposal.
- This proposal is a live/work loft that in his view is trendy and 
    ultramodern.
- The entire first floor will be all glass with a triangular protrusion.  
    There is glass from floor to ceiling.
- No one on the block or in the neighborhood has this design.  The 
    design simply is not in keeping with neighborhood character.
- It will stand out and look significantly different than anything 
    else in the neighborhood.
- Anyone driving north on Bernal Heights Boulevard or just walking 
    to the park at the top of the hill will stare at this building.
- At night, it will be fully lit.  He believes that it will be a distraction 
    to drivers on Bernal Heights Boulevard.
- For this reason alone, he feels that the construction should be modified.  
    As for his concerns, he feels that the adjacent homes will feel a loss of 
    privacy.
- He believes that a flat back wall with less glass would be more appropriate.
- The size of the windows should be reduced as well.
(+) Mark Lindsell – Project Architect
- He would 
    like to address the comment made by the previous speaker about the drawings.
- It is true that there were revised drawings issued very late in the 
    process.  The only change that was made was that the neighbor's house was 
    longer than what was shown on the previous drawings.  So the amount of extension 
    of the proposed building was actually less.  The drawing actually showed a 
    smaller impact to the neighbor than was originally shown.
- This neighborhood has a mix of home styles.
- The neighbor has expressed concerns that the new construction will 
    allow people to look into his backyard.  People can look into his backyard 
    right now.
- The neighbor has also expressed concerns about the deck extending 
    too far out.  The deck will not extend that much.

- He took a long time to try to get his neighbors to support 
    his project.  He contacted his neighbors to his side and to the front of his 
    house.
- Mr. Dare does not live in the property next to his house.  He rents 
    it out.
- He contacted the people who live there, showed them the plans several 
    times, and had full support from them.
- He also contacted the people living across the street, whose view 
    will be impacted very slightly when they raise the roof about a foot.
- He also showed the plans to the people living to the north since 
    they would be impacted as well so he revised the plans to consider their issues.
- He received 9 letters in support of his project.
- This project will not be a live/work project.  It will be a single-family 
    house.
- Also, this is not a Victorian neighborhood.  It's a mixed-use neighborhood.
- The project will only stick out 6 inches from his neighbor's house.  
    Since the project will be located to the north so he doesn't believe that 
    his neighbor's house will be impacted in any way.
ACTION:           Do not take DR and approve project as proposed.

769-791 CASTRO STREET- east side between Liberty and 21st Streets, 
    Lot 025 in Assessor's Block 3603.  Staff-initiated Discretionary Review of 
    Building Permit Application No. 2001/02/20/2498, proposing to merge two dwelling 
    units into one dwelling unit in a RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District 
    and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and disapprove 
    the building permit application
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Alice Barkley – Representing Project Sponsor
-These units will be converted back into a family home.  What 
    the Commission is looking at is just eliminating one small unit but providing 
    for a family's needs.
- In the last 5 years, more families have moved into the City.  The 
    problem is that it's difficult for families to move back into the City.
- There will be a family of 5 living in the combined units.
- The housing production in the past has focused on smaller units.  
    There are simply not enough units that are suitable for families.
- In terms of density, when you look at a family of five living in 
    what is going to be basically a three-bedroom unit versus two-single family 
    units, the same number of people, probably more, are going to be living in 
    this building.
(+) Denise Ledbetter
- They have lived in San Francisco for many years.
- They used to live in Noe Valley for many years.
- In 1999 they started the architectural drawings to expand their Noe 
    Valley home.  Because of the housing boom they realized that the expansion 
    would be too expensive.
- They realized that they would have to rent for a few months in order 
    to get their expansion completed.
- They decided to move and purchase the property on Castro Street.  
    This house had originally been a single family home and would be easy to convert 
    back to the way it was.
(+) Joe O'Donaghue – Residential Builders
- These people bought their home before this Commission approved the 
    merger policy.
- This case is about retaining families in this City.
- These people were put into a fix because of our laws and they should 
    not be punished because of these laws.
- For 60 years, this building was a single-family residence.
- Please don't drive families out of this City.
(+/-) Sue Hestor
- A lot of houses in San Francisco don't have central heating.  Space 
    heaters rule in San Francisco because of the climate.
- She has never lived in an apartment that had central heating.
- It's a slippery slope if you start saying that it's impossible to 
    provide code compliant heat without going to something more elaborate.
