ORDINANCE AMENDING THE SAN FRANCISCO PLANNING CODE BY AMENDING ARTICLE 3.5 TO INCREASE FEES RELATED TO PERMIT AND OTHER REVIEWS.
Consideration of approval of proposed amendments to increase fees intended and designed to allow the Planning Department to generate the revenue necessary to cover the cost of carrying out the Planning Department's mission.
Preliminary Recommendation:  Approve the draft resolution recommending to the Board of Supervisors that the proposed ordinance be adopted as presented.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Patricia Vaughey
- There are no enforcement fees.
- The biggest problem in the Planning Department is that there is a lack of enforcement.
- Senior Citizens own a lot of property in San Francisco but they cannot afford to pay Discretionary Review fees.
- Many of the neighborhood activists seem to be taking on the task of enforcement instead of the Planning Department.
(-) Tom McDonough
- He owns a solar energy company.
- There is need to use technology more.
- It is very expensive to do business in San Francisco.
- This should be more efficient and streamlined.
(-) Kirk Scott
- He is concerned with Discretionary Review fees and building permit fees.
- There are legal problems with establishing nexus fees and Discretionary Review fees.
- If the DR fees are increased, there will be less and less frivolous cases.
- What kinds of benefits accrue?  Community benefits or individual benefits?
(+) Joe O'Donaghue
- Developers are not being impacted directly; it is the consumer.
- One of the things that the Commission should be taking into consideration is the incredible cost that the Board of Supervisors has imposed on the Commission without any cost benefit to the Commission or any cost reimbursement.
- The Board of Supervisors have become a defacto Planning Commission.
(-) Maria Souza
- She is concerned with the increase of Discretionary Review fees because many of the residents of the Richmond District have fixed incomes.
- She suggested that if a DR project prevails, they should be the ones to carry out the fees.
- If fees will be increased, this will create an incentive to approve those project and those issues.
(-) Marilyn Amini
- She is concerned about Discretionary Reviews.
- It is unfair for people who cannot afford to pay the increase in fees.
ACTION: Approved as Amended: The Ordinance Discretionary Review language was amended to state that the Department will charge $200 for the first two hours of staff time.
