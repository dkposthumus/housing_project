Garfield Street; Lots 035 and 036 in Assessor’s Block 6995 (District 11) – Request for 
Conditional Use Authorization, pursuant to Planning Code Sections 303 and 317 to authorize 
the tantamount demolition a single-family home that straddles two lots within a RH-1 
(Residential-House, One-Family) Zoning District, Oceanview Large Residence Special Use

two lots. The existing home operates a State licensed in-home childcare facility for less than

includes the legalization of the play structure at the rear of the property which serves as a 
rain shelter for the in-home childcare outdoor play area. This action constitutes the Approval 
Action for the project for the purposes of CEQA, pursuant to San Francisco Administrative 
Code Section 31.04(h).
