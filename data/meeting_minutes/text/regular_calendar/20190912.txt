BALBOA RESERVOIR PROJECT – (Assessor’s Block 3180, Lot 190) – Public Hearing on the 
Draft Environmental Impact Report. The 17.6-acre project site is the western portion (the 
“lower basin”) of the Balboa Reservoir located west of City College and north of Ocean 
Avenue in the Balboa Park Station Plan Area. The publicly owned project site currently 
functions as a surface vehicle parking lot. Two different options for the site’s residential 
density are under consideration: (1) the Developer’s Proposed Option (1,100 dwelling 
units), proposed by Reservoir Community Partners LLC; and (2) the Additional Housing 
Option (1,550 dwelling units), proposed by the City. Overall, the proposed project would 
construct up to approximately 1.8 million gross square feet of uses, including between 
approximately 1.3 and 1.5 million gross square feet of residential space, approximately 
10,000 gross square feet of community space, approximately 7,500 gross square feet of 
retail, up to 550 residential parking spaces and 750 public parking spaces in the 
Developer’s Proposed Option, and up to 650 residential parking spaces in the Additional 
Housing Option. The buildings would range in height from 25 to 78 feet in the Developer’s 
Proposed Option and from 25 to 88 feet in the Additional Housing Option. Approximately 
4 acres would be devoted to publicly accessible open space. The project site is located in a 
Public (P) Zoning District and 40-X and 65-A Height and Bulk Districts.  
NOTE: Written comments will be accepted at the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m. on
