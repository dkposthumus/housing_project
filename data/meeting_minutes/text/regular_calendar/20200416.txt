Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC). The proposed project would “recapture” 
water that the SFPUC is required to release or bypass upstream in Alameda Creek as part of 
operation of the SFPUC’s new Calaveras Dam. Water would be pumped from an existing 
quarry pit in the Sunol Valley, which collects Alameda Creek water through subsurface 
seepage, to the SFPUC’s regional water supply system. No construction would occur in 
Alameda Creek.
