- Georgia Schuttish – A couple of points: Not enough attention has been given to 
impact from the project on 251 Texas Street, a multi-unit, rent controlled building. The 
fourth floor was not on original project approved by the Commission and denied by 
the Board and maybe it should be removed? At the May 23rd hearing, the architect

said there was no exposure in some of the existing bedrooms in the UDU. But the 
second unit in the new building only has one bedroom and no exposure in the 
designated sleeping area. He also said “the ceilings height throughout the entire unit 
ranged from somewhere between 7’2” and 7’6” for many portions of it”. 7’6” is legal. 
Aren’t both legal in California? For this and all UDUs/occupied units it would be good 
if project sponsors informed Staff at start. And if sound, existing units could be better 
preserved, not Demo’ed.
