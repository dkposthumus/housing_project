SPEAKER(S):
(-) Lock Holmes - Representing Discretionary Review Requestor

- Parking is also an issue with this project.
- It is important to analyze the regulations.
(-) Welton Rotz
- The developer has been speaking for about a year.
- They found out that it is not permissible to build a "bump out."

- He displayed diagrams to show the extent of the pop out.

- Through the course of the year, her representative has met with the neighbors to discuss thoroughly the project.
