the Citywide Planning Division, would redesign and provide a program of transportation 
and streetscape improvements within the project corridor, including changes to the 
roadway configuration and private vehicle access, traffic signals, surface transit (including 
Muni-only lanes, stop spacing and service, stop locations, stop characteristics, and 
infrastructure), bicycle facilities, pedestrian facilities, streetscapes, commercial and 
passenger loading, vehicular parking, and utilities. A new bi-directional F Market & 
Wharves historic streetcar (F-Line) track loop (F-loop) would be implemented on Charles J. 
Brenham Place and McAllister Street and traffic configurations would change on adjacent 
streets intersecting Market Street to both the north and south. The proposed project 
would also partially restore, reconstruct, and realign the Path of Gold (City Landmark No. 
200) light standards to accommodate a new overhead contact system to increase transit 
service along Market Street; remove or alter several streetscape features, including the red 
brick sidewalk and plazas, granite curbs, street trees, traffic signals and signage. In addition 
to the proposed project, the sponsor is considering a variant (the Western Variant) that 
would implement further improvements over the proposed project to pedestrian and 
bicyclist safety, comfort, and mobility through additional reductions to conflicts between 
different modes of transportation between Octavia Boulevard and about 300 feet east of 
the Hayes and Market Street intersection. Written comments will be accepted at the 
Planning Department until 5:00 p.m. on April 15, 2019.
