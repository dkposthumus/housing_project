HOUSING ELEMENT 2022 UPDATE – Informational Presentation – The Housing Element 2022 
Update of the General Plan is San Francisco's first housing plan centered in racial and social 
equity. This plan will express the city’s collective vision and values for the future of housing 
in San Francisco. It will also identify priorities for decision makers, guide resource allocation 
for housing programs and services, and define how and where the city should create new 
homes for San Franciscans, or those who want to call this city home. This update is due late 
2022 and it will need to accommodate the creation of 82,000 units by 2031, a target set by 
State and Regional Agencies that has been tripled compared to the city’s current targets. 
Community outreach and engagement for the 2022 Update began in June 2020, and the 
second phase of outreach was launched in April 2021 with the release of the first draft goals, 
policies, and actions. The purpose of this hearing is to inform the public about the strategies 
used for outreach and engagement during Phase 2, the communities engaged, a brief 
overview of some of the input shared, and the upcoming steps to analyze public input to 
shape the second draft. Draft 2 is scheduled to be released early next year.
