– Request for Discretionary Review of Building Permit No. 2017.1026.2309 to raise and relocate the existing 
one-story single-family residence and construct a two-story rear horizontal addition within a RH-2 (Residential 
House – Two Family) Zoning District and 40-X Height and Bulk District. The Planning Department found that 
the project is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The Commission’s action

Preliminary Recommendation: Do Not Take Discretionary Review and Approve 
SPEAKERS: 
= David Winslow – Staff report  
- Marc Norton – DR presentation 
+ Fabian Lanoye – Project sponsor presentation 
- Georgia Schuttish – Support the Request for Discretionary Review. There should 
be a preservation plan as proposed by the Requestor and his consultant. The EQ 
Cottage is an important historical resource for the City and County of San Francisco. 
The EQ Cottage should not be subject to such a major relocation and lifting on the 
lot. This is the most important issue and the crux of the Request for Discretionary 
Review. There are issues to be resolved regarding the Demo Calcs and Clarification 
#1 in the Section 317 Code Implementation Document (CID) and with the 1938 
Aerial photos specifically for this project and generally as well in how Clarification 
#1 is applied during review of projects and how the 1938 Aerial photos are applied 
during review of projects.

- Megan Smith, Victorian Alliance – 1906 cottages are rare, should be preserved
