1-6 MEACHAM PLACE- Meacham 
    Place is a narrow, dead-end alley between Hyde and Larkin in Assessor’s Block 
    302, access is from Post Street.  The project is a consideration of a proposal 
    to install an iron swing gate at the entrance of Meacham Place.  The project 
    would also involve the installation of planter boxes along the sidewalks and 
    back wall of the alley.
Preliminary 
    Recommendation: Find that proposal is not in conformity with the General Plan.
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Denise Rosser
- This proposal has been around 
    for many years.
- The purpose of the gate is not 
    for private use; it is for safety.  The street is a dead-end street and there 
    has been a lot of illegal activity going on.
- They just want a gate to ensure 
    their safety.
- Every building on the street has 
    installed exterior lighting; the neighbors clean the street themselves, and 
    have put gates on windows.  They have tried every measure to have the street 
    be safer.
- There is no reason for a service 
    vehicle to get into the street.  The parked cars that are there block their 
    home access.
- She would like to have the Commission 
    really look at the proposal and approve the project.
(+) Captain Kevin Dillon – Commanding 
    Office – Police Department
- Despite their best efforts they 
    have been unable to control the illegal activity on the street.  Unfortunately, 
    their proximity to the Tenderloin makes it difficult to control.
- Although there are other issues 
    regarding the Fire Department, which he can't provide comment on, he feels 
    that their only answer for safety it gating off the street.
(+) David Overdorf
- When they asked for maintenance 
    of the street or paving, the City mentioned that the service vehicles would 
    not be able to get in or out of the street.
- Now that they want a gate installed, 
    the City decides that it cannot approve this because it's a street for public 
    use.
- The neighbors have tried everything 
    to make this street safe.
- The City said that the neighbors 
    are responsible for paving it.  Everyone is happy to do so but why are they 
    responsible for this but can't put a gate up because they are tired of the 
    illegal activity?
- This problem is quite severe.  
    He displayed pictures of how some cars park on the sidewalk and block their 
    gates and doors.  They have called police to have these cars towed yet during 
    the late hours the police have limited staff.
(+) Eric Rosser
- He lives on this street with his 
    family.  He was born and raised in San Francisco.
- There has been a deterioration 
    of the standard of living for many people.
- The area has an incredible amount 
    of illegal activity going on which has become intolerable.
- They would like the Commission 
    to make a decision that would improve the City.
- It is a very dangerous place for 
    him and his family to live.
(+) Richard Mayer
- He supports the installation of 
    the gate.
- One of his employees was assaulted 
    and robbed on this alley.  They have established a policy that their employees 
    not walk the alley by themselves.
- His concern is that a car could 
    hurt an individual, who cannot be seen.
- There is a very large, high-pressure 
    gas line for his company and there have been a lot of individuals starting 
    bonfires on the street.
ACTION:Found that the proposal is not in conformity with the General 
    Plan. The proposal to gate the alley was disapproved.
AYES:Baltimore, 
    Chinchilla, Fay, Joe, Salinas, Theoharis

678 PORTOLA DRIVE- between 
    Sidney Way and Woodside Avenue; Lot 004 in Assessor’s Block 2892.  Request 
    for Conditional-Use Authorization pursuant to Section 209.6(b) of the Planning 
    Code to install a total of nine antennas and a base transceiver station on 
    an existing church building as part of Nextel's wireless telecommunications 
    network in an RH-1 (D)(Residential, House, Single-Family, Detached) District 
    and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation: Approval 
    with conditions
SPEAKER(s)
(+) Molly Gills – Nextel Communications
- This site is needed to fill in the coverage gap when Nextel 
    removes antenna from Sutro Tower.
- The equipment will not be visible.
- The equipment will not cause interruption to televisions, 
    cordless phones, etc.
- There were community meetings at the church and 7 people 
    attended.
- A public notice was sent to neighbors regarding this meeting.
(+) Alicia Duke
- The Nextel project happens to be in use and hopefully will 
    be used soon.
- The manager of the San Francisco branch has tried every type 
    of possible phone there is and Nextel has proven to have a  no dead  zone.
- She hopes that this project will be approved.
- This would benefit the elderly and disabled.
(-) Elizabeth Mettling – Miraloma Park Improvement Club
- The church has a nursery school in the basement.
- This type of equipment is not allowed on schools so why is 
    it allowed on this building?
- Tower Market has equipment so she doesn't understand why 
    this is considered a  dead zone.
- The equipment should not be allowed near children.
(-) Olie Kauffman
- His house is across the street from the church.
- It's a single-family residence; if Nextel would come to his 
    house, would the Commission allow that to happen (install their antenna on 
    it)?
- There is still scientific research that this type of equipment 
    is hazardous to health.
- He never received any calls or any documents regarding 
    this meeting.  He found out about it through neighbors.
ACTION No. 1:There was a motion for the project to 
    be continued.  It failed to move forward because it did not receive a second.
ACTION No. 2:Approved as proposed
