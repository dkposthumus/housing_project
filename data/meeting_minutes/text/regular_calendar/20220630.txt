TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES (TNCs) AND LAND USE PLANNING STUDY – 
Informational Presentation – Ridehailing services offered by transportation network 
companies (TNCs, like Lyft or Uber) have been operating in San Francisco since 2010. TNC 
usage grew substantially in the years before the pandemic and are on the rise today. City 
agencies, including the Planning Department, SFMTA, and Transportation Authority have 
been collaborating on studies looking at how TNCs affect congestion, access and mobility 
for people with disabilities, and other factors. Staff will present a Planning Department-led 
study on the effects of TNCs on land use planning, including interactions with the San 
Francisco General Plan, Planning Code, and environmental review. Policy options for the 
Planning Department are provided to address these impacts. Additionally, TNCs may 
preview what may come from the use of autonomous vehicles (“self-driving” cars) for 
passenger services. The policy options to address TNC impacts can also prepare San 
Francisco for this technology. 
Preliminary Recommendation: None – Informational

1500-1540 MARKET STREET (ONE OAK) – north side between Oak Street and Van Ness 
Avenue; Lots 001, 002, 003, 004 and 005 in Assessor’s Block 0836 (District 5) – Adoption of 
Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations under the California Environmental 
Quality Act (CEQA). The proposed project (“Project”) would demolish two, non-residential 
buildings and surface parking lot and construct a new 40-story building reaching a roof 
height up to 400 feet tall (approximately 416 feet tall inclusive of mechanical equipment, or 
437 feet tall inclusive of elevator overrun and rooftop screening). The Project includes 
approximately 455,000 gross square feet of residential uses, and approximately 2,500 gross 
square feet of ground floor retail, with a total of 460 dwelling units comprised of 100 studio 
units, 159 one-bedroom units, and 201 two-bedroom units. The Project includes 112 off-
street accessory parking spaces, three car share spaces, one off-street freight loading space, 
two off-street service loading vehicle spaces, and 190 Class 1 and 25 Class 2 bicycle parking 
spaces. To further activate the ground floor experience, the Project would construct a public 
plaza and shared public right-of-way within a portion of the Oak Street (Oak Plaza). At a later 
date, the Project Sponsor will seek approval of an In-Kind Fee Waiver Agreement in order to 
provide additional public realm improvements within Oak Plaza. These additional public 
realm improvements will be subject to the Planning Commission’s separate and future 
approval of the Project Sponsor’s In-Kind Fee Waiver Agreement. The subject property is 
located within a C-3-G (Downtown General) Zoning District, Van Ness & Market Downtown 
Residential SUD (Special Use District), and 120/400-R-2 and 120-R-2 Height and Bulk 
Districts.
