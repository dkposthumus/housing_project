+ Kate Stoia – Project sponsor presentation 
- Georgia Schuttish – Demo Calcs presented on plans illustrating the
amount of removal are very sketchy. Created problems for the Staff
because they are vague and hard to review. One iteration in error.
Ultimately so close to TTD that a “warning letter” is required. Project 
illustrates why the Calcs should be adjusted. Upper unit at 50 28th Street 
not an efficient use of space at over 2500 square feet on two levels. First 
level of unit is 1400 square feet which is average size of a unit in San
Francisco. This level could accommodate a family sized three-bedroom
unit, creating an affordable by design dwelling unit. 4199 Mission Street
project approved has four three-bedroom units that are each 1240 square
