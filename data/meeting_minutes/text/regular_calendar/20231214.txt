TENANT PROTECTIONS– Informational Presentation on the regulations, programs, and policies that protect San 
Francisco’s renters. Planning Department staff will be joined by staff from the Rent Board and from the Mayor’s 
Office of Housing and Community Development. 
Preliminary Recommendation: None – Informational 
SPEAKERS: 
= Dan Sider – Staff presentation 
= Joey Koomas – SF Rent Board presentation 
= Hugo Ramirez – MOHCD presentation 
= Georgia Schuttish – The Residential Flat Policy needs to be codified. This is a tool that 
the Commission can use to protect tenants…now and in the future. Many Flats have 
been lost over the past decade throughout the City. Tenants are evicted or bought-out. 
Flats have been turned into mega mansion single family homes, speculative 
developments that have increased the prices by millions of dollars. Residential Flats 
are everywhere, throughout the City. They are a vital part of the City’s housing stock. 
Flats are usually equal in size and may have unoccupied space on the ground level that 
can be converted into a third Flat or ADU. The Flat policy should be codified to preserve 
Flats in their original configuration and location within a structure. The spine of a Flat 
is the hallway that links the rooms from front to rear. The hallway is an objective design 
feature. Flats provide family housing.

505 BRANNAN STREET – south side between 4th and 5th Streets; Lot 322 in Assessor’s Block 3786 (District 6) – 
Request for Large Project Authorization pursuant to Planning Code Section 329 to allow the construction of a 
vertical addition of more than 85 feet in height and greater than 50,000 gross square feet and an exception from 
the wind compliance guidelines of the Central SoMa SUD (Section 249.78(d)(7) for a Project that would construct 
an 11-story, approximately 125,000-square-foot vertical addition on top of the existing six-story, approximately 
122,000-square-foot building containing Office and Retail Uses. The Project is the second phase of a mixed-use 
office development at the Project Site, with phase one being the existing building constructed in 2018 (approved 
through Motion Nos. 19293–19295 under Planning Department Case No. 2012.1187BCX). The existing building 
was designed to accommodate the Project from the outset, both structurally and programmatically. The Project 
would add approximately 115,000 square feet of Office Use to the Project Site and convert approximately 10,000 
square feet of Office Use at the existing ground floor and basement level one to Arts Activities (a Production, 
Distribution, and Repair use). No changes are proposed to the existing basement level two, streetscape, or 
number of vehicular and bicycle parking spaces. While the Project will add approximately 125,000 square feet of 
office space to the Project Site, only 95,000 square feet of net new office space is being requested for allocation. 
This is because the approval for the existing six-story building allocated 137,446 square feet of office space to the 
Project Site but the existing building only used 116,814 square feet of office space once constructed, resulting in 
a surplus allocation of 20,632 square feet. In addition, the Project proposes to convert 10,236 square feet of office 
space in the existing building to an Arts Activities use. The surplus allocation from the existing building combined 
with the additional office square footage available once existing office space is converted to a different use 
results in 30,868 square feet of office space that has already been approved for the Project Site being available 
to use toward the Project’s office addition, so that only 95,000 square feet of net new office allocation must be 
sought. The project site is located within the CMUO (Central SoMa-Mixed Use Office) Zoning District, Central 
SoMa SUD (Special Use District), and 250-CS Height and Bulk District. The Planning Department issued a 
community plan evaluation pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The Commission’s 
action constitutes the Approval Action for the project for the purposes of CEQA, pursuant to San Francisco 
Administrative Code Section 31.04 (h).
