SFMTA: 2500 MARIPOSA STREET – north side of Mariposa Street, the entire block bounded 
by 17th, Mariposa, Bryant, and Hampshire streets; Lot 001 in Assessor’s Block 3971 – Public 
Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Report. The proposed project would demolish 
the existing Potrero Trolley Coach Division Facility (Potrero Yard), a California Register of 
Historic Resources–eligible historic resource and replace it with a new transit facility to 
accommodate the expansion of the SFMTA’s transit vehicle fleet. The project would include 
bus parking and circulation (up to 213 buses); SFMTA maintenance, operation, and 
administrative uses; and joint development (residential and commercial) uses as part of a 
joint development program between SFMTA and a private project co-sponsor. The new, 
approximately 1,300,000 gross-square-foot structure would rise to heights ranging from 75 
to 150 feet across the site. It would contain a three-level, approximately 75-foot-tall 
replacement transit facility (723,000 gross square feet) plus a joint development with a mix 
of commercial (33,000 gross square feet) and residential uses (up to 544,000 gross square 
feet and 575 units). The majority of residential development would be atop the replacement 
transit facility on floors seven through 13. The proposed project includes four variants that 
consider modifications to limited features or aspects of the project: the Emergency Exit 
Relocation Variant; the Joint Development Lobby Relocation Variant; the Active 17th Street 
Variant; and the Employee and Family Support Variant, which would include a child care use. 
The project site is within a Public (P) Use District and 65-X Height and Bulk District.  
Written comments will be accepted at CPC.PotreroYardEIR@sfgov.org or at the Planning 
Department until 5:00 p.m. on August 31, 2021.
