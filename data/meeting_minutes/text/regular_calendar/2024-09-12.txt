CANDLESTICK POINT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT – GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY FINDINGS ASSOCIATED WITH 
REDEVELOPMENT PLAN AMENDMENTS – The Candlestick Point development project consists of roughly 281 
acres at Candlestick Point and generally encompasses the former Candlestick Park Stadium and parking lot, the 
Candlestick Point State Recreational Area, the Alice Griffith Housing development site, and Assessor’s Blocks 
4917, 4918, 4934, and 4935 – Request for Adoption of Findings of Consistency with the General Plan and the 
eight priority policies of Planning Code Section 101.1 for amendments to both the Bayview Hunters Point 
Redevelopment Plan and the Hunters Point Shipyard Redevelopment Plan. These amendments would: (1) allow 
the transfer of 2,050,000 square feet of office / research and development (R&D) entitlement from Hunters Point 
Shipyard (HPS) to Candlestick Point (CP); (2) allow visitor and entertainment uses throughout most of CP; (3) 
confirm certain commercial uses, such as “maker space”, permitted at HPS, are also permitted at CP; (4) adjust 
Redevelopment Plan time limits;  and (5) adjust certain Redevelopment Plan financing provisions and time 
limits. The amendments would enable the continued implementation of the Candlestick Point Development 
Project, including a re-envisioned Candlestick Center (one of four planned neighborhoods at Candlestick Point) 
as an “Innovation District” that would include approximately 2,800,000 square feet of office, R&D, and other 
similar and supporting uses. Candlestick Point is within the Candlestick Point Activity Node Special Use District, 
the CP Height and Bulk District, and within Zone 1 of Area B of the Bayview Hunters Point Redevelopment 
Project Area.  
Preliminary Recommendation: Adopt Findings of Consistency
