WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES FACILITIES SITING GUIDELINES- Consideration of approval of a Resolution to supplement the 1996 Wireless Telecommunications Services Facilities Siting Guidelines and adopt Department policies not in the Guidelines. These policies are intended to supplement the objectives established in Resolution 14182 adopted in August 1996.
SPEAKER(S):
(+/-) Misako Hill. Cingular Wireless
-The Wireless industry is contributing to the San Francisco industry.
-The San Francisco General Plan states that the City's first goal is to maintain and expand a vibrant economy that will provide jobs and revenue.
-Metropolitan Electric Construction is an example of how a local small business is working in San Francisco. This company is located in the Bayview District and has over 90 employees, including union electricians that are dedicated to the wireless projects in the City. Metropolitan Electric Construction estimated that the wireless industry accounted for more than $10,000,000 in annual revenue in the City in 2002.
-This company gave back to the community and paid their taxes.
(+/-) Jennifer Estes, Sprint PCS
-Spoke about item 1 of the proposed resolution, community outreach and public notification.
(+/-) Doug Chuck
- Concerned about the system that is being used to notify the public.
(+/-) Peter Mausharar, Verizon Wireless
-The Guidelines that exist today in San Francisco are some of the most comprehensive in the entire state...--the western United States for that matter.
-We have worked very diligently with Planning staff in the past to come up with some reasonable changes to these guidelines.
-We do actively update our information on the Five Year Plan for the City every six months. Sometimes, when the necessity of site comes up, we can only predict out our build plan based on budget constraints, changes in the economy, customer's complaints, service problems, etc. Our updates to the Five Year Plan are generated from this information-the areas that we need to improve by adding additional sites etc.
(+/-) Paul Albrittan, ATT Wireless
-Outlined some of their concerns about the excessive necessary requirements like noticing requirements and the retroactive application of what they consider to be an amendment to the guidelines.
(-) Doug Loranger, Snafu
-Urged the Commission to take three actions: 1) Reject the Planning Department's recommendations with respect to necessity, site compliance and coverage maps; 2) Follow the lead of President Bradford Bell at the 12/10/02 Wireless hearing and Supervisor Ammiano at the Board meeting on 2/20/03 and instruct the Planning Department to make revisions of the guidelines a priority in its 2003 Work Program Budget and propose industry fees to fund this process; and 3) Insure that the process that began over two years ago when Snafu invited members of the industry to attend their meeting with Mayor Brown on this issue, continue in a fair, reasonable, timely and comprehensive manner.
(-) Libby Kelly, Council on Wireless Technology Impacts
-Asked the Commission to consider and revise the guidelines. Also to consider the environment where this equipment would be operating.
-Electrical pollution: We now have well over 2400 licensed and permitted cellular antennas in the City.
-Cellular antennas are relatively new and scientific evidence is still emerging.
(-) Madeline Camisa
-Requested that any new modifications to the siting guidelines should re-categorize schools, hospitals, health centers, places of worship, libraries, community centers, public use structures, and mixed-use or wholly residential buildings from preference 1 sites to preference 7 sites.
(-) Stella Cheng
-Urged the Commission to listen to the citizens of San Francisco and make the right decision.
(-) Jolie Holland
-There was inadequate notification of this to the neighborhoods.
(-) Megan Sullivan
-Addressed the problem concerning the Planning Department's lack of expertise with regard to wireless space station technology issues.
(-) Ruby Chung
-Respectfully asked the Commission to revise the guidelines the right way so they would not be detrimental to residential neighborhoods. To also not approve anymore installation of antennas because we have more than enough throughout San Francisco.
(-) Frieda Humboldt
-It is very important that the City start implementing/enforcing its own code permit violations and non-compliance cases.
-The City would enforce permit violations when small business owners make them, but when wireless breaks the rules, little or nothing is done about it.
-The Planning Department resolution in front of you today does not address this issue at all. And I think it is time for change.
(-) Gordon Winiemko
-Asked the Commission to reject the resolution/permit .
(-) Bran Benson, Supervisor Ammiano's Office
-Supervisor Ammiano suggested that the Planning Commission consider having a joint hearing with the Land Use Committee of the Board of Supervisors to discuss whether or not the Planning Commission wants to take any action, and what action the Board of Supervisors would recommend.
(-) Grace Jeung
-We need to have these guidelines brought up to date and be more restrictive.
(-) Fay Adelstein
-Concerned about the health problems to humans.
-How to insure that the people of San Francisco are protected from the adverse effects of the cellular antennas?
(-) Tracey Hughes
-Asked the Commission to not approve this new resolution.
(-) David Thornheim
-Urged the Commission to hold off on adopting this resolution. Instead, work more closely with the Board of Supervisors regarding Supervisor Ammiano's resolution and the Snafu proposed amendments.
(-) Rosemarie Jair
-It will be better if the City does not allow these antennas to go on places of worship in the first place.
(-) Mark Zier
-Opposed to the new resolution.
-Asked the Commission to look into the requirements of necessity that are in this particular resolution.
(-) Arletta Sen
-Opposed to the resolution. She is for a moratorium, or the very least, broad-based regulations based on what the communities, the people of San Francisco, really do want.
(-) Todd Curtis
-Current guidelines before you have a lot of loopholes as they are presently written. They play into the sales industry efforts to install more antennas.
(-) Scott Dykes
-Opposed to the new resolution.
(+/-) Ron Miguel
-One thing that should be clarified when the guidelines are revised is the question of necessity.
(-) Lynne Elmar
-Opposes the new resolution.
(-) Mark Longwood
-Opposed to the new resolution.
(-) Stephen Eastman
-Did not get the appropriate notification about this meeting.
(-) Gloria Tulanowski
-Opposed to the new resolution.
(-) Michael Stendurg
-Opposed to the new resolution.
(-) George Robertson
-Surprised that the proposed guidelines don't have anything regarding installations on senior citizen buildings.
-What are we going to give to our children if you put these antennas on top of the schools?
-Need to look at these guidelines more carefully.
(-) Doris Linnebach
- Opposed the new resolution.
ACTION: Approved as amended:
1) Community Outreach meetings shall be required for all sites that require a conditional use authorization; a 500 foot radius will be required for mailings; the notice will include language identifying it as an announcement for a "Community Outreach Meeting on a Wireless Communication Facility proposed in your neighborhood;" and the subject building shall be posted with a notice identifying the meeting subject matter, time and place.
2) The Planning Commission shall pursue the revision of the WTS Guidelines in cooperation with the Board of Supervisor's Land Use Committee, the Telecommunications Commission, and the Commission on the Environment, when the appropriate funding and staffing has been allocated to the Planning Department.

BACKGROUND NOTE: On June 27, 2002, following public testimony, the Commission closed the public hearing. The Commission entertained two motions: 1) Approve with modifications and require staff to approve design. The motion failed to carry for lack of a second; 2) Approve with modifications and require staff to approve design, bedroom mix and open space. The motion failed to carry by vote of +3 -3. Commissioners Baltimore, Joe and Salinas voted no. Commissioner Fay was absent. At the call of the Chair, the matter was continued to July 18, 2002.Following the June 27, 2002, hearing, the Mission Interim Controls were amended such that a new Conditional Use Authorization is now required. Accordingly, the Commission will conduct a new hearing during which public comment will be re-opened.
NOTE: On January 23, 2003, this matter was noticed for re-hearing. On that date the Commission continued the item to March 13, 2003 to allow for a briefing on the Eastern Neighborhoods, which includes the Mission District. The Public Hearing is Open.
SPEAKERS ON THE CONTINUANCE ONLY:
(-) Geri Almanza
-Opposed the continuance because a lot of people took time off from their jobs to attend this meeting and we would like their time to be respected.
(-) Erick Quezada
-What are the reasons that the developers are requesting a continuance?
-We tried to work with these developers, they haven't come back with any other changes to the project in the many weeks since this has been proposed. We haven't heard from them on that so we see no reason for the continuance.
(+) Joel Yodowitz
-We did send a letter to Mr. Quezada expressing the reasons why we need to continue this matter. This project is one of the first large residential projects in the Mission District following the Planning Commission's briefing on the Eastern Neighborhoods. We believe a continuance is necessary to adequately present the project to a full Commission.
(+) Aida (Ada) Chan
-Opposed continuance.
(+) Chris Selig
-We would like to proceed with the meeting today. Have both sides say whatever they have to say and that will be end of it.
ACTION: Continued to March 20, 2003

RESULT:Without a majority vote the motion failed, and without a successful alternate motion the matter will be heard today.
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Joel Yodowitz, Representing Project Sponsor
-As all of you know, this project has a very long and public history.
-The project sponsor has conducted extensive neighborhood outreach, including meeting with individuals and groups, focusing within 300 feet of the project.
-There has been multiple neighborhood meetings with invitations forward in English and Spanish, interpreters were present at each of these meetings.
-The Project Sponsor's efforts should be a model for community outreach and planning.
(+) Andrew Keller, Architect
-Gave an overall description of the project.
(-) Richard Marquez, Mission Agenda
-Mission Agenda is adamantly opposed to this project.
-Despite the Dot.com boom and bust, hundreds of working Latinos were displaced and/or evicted.
-Despite the lost of PDR jobs, despite the desperation of family housing, this struggle continues.
(-) Nick Pagoulatos
- Concerned about housing affordability in the Mission.
-This is a critical site.
-The importance here is that this is transitional land. And even though there has been a lot of work done (struggles, etc.) to finally get the 12% affordability ordinance for housing in general, the City can not stop there. We need to continue and try to find out how we can increase the number of affordable units, both through non-profit development and of course through private market development.
-Asked the Commission to look at this project very carefully and set a precedent that is fair to the community and the developers.
(-) Geri Almanza
-Asked the Commission to make the following modifications to the proposed project: 1) we need larger overall units (2 to 3 bedrooms); 2) need deeper affordability, 60% of median income does not met the needs of our community. We need more like 40% of median income; 3) we want to see that affordable units will remain affordable for the life span of the building.
(-) Aurora Amazola
-Respectfully asked the Commission to approve affordable housing for low-income, hard working people in the Mission District.
(-) Sarai Y.R., Yoco-Hop
-Opposed the proposed project unless they include more affordable housing.

(-) Margarita Mendoza

(-) Jackie Marenco
-Oppose the project because the Mission District does not need more over priced one-room apartments. The Mission is very family oriented and needs more affordable 2 to 3 bedroom apartments.
(-) Bill Murphy
-This project does not fit in the neighborhood. It won't benefit anybody that lives there.
(-) Marcella Azucar
-Opposed the project because it is a human right to have housing.

-Asked the Commission to look very seriously at what affordability means?
