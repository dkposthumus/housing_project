O'SHAUGHNESSY DAM DISCHARGE MODIFICATION PROJECT- O'Shaughnessy Dam is located at Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, in Yosemite National Park (Tuolumne County).  The area is accessed by Camp Mather Road off Highway 120.Appeal of a Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration. The project consists of modifying the piping at O'Shaughnessy Dam that controls discharge to the existing 108-inch Canyon Power Tunnel pipeline (or penstock) at the base of the dam, and the downstream water transmission system. The piping modification involves construction of a new 60-inch pipeline to allow withdrawal of water from a higher level in the reservoir, to be used when turbidity in the reservoir is above the allowable level.  The project also involves demolition of the lower valve house.  The purpose of the project is to improve the water quality and water supply from Hetch Hetchy Reservoir to the City and Country of San Francisco and its water customers by constructing a second higher outlet to the aqueduct from the reservoir.

(+) John Rizzo - Sierra Club
- The Sierra Club supports the appeal.

- This project should be included in the environmental analysis of the whole set of projects from PUC.
(+) Ron Good - Executive Director of Restore Hetch Hetchy
- A full environmental impact report and EIS must be prepared under CEQA because this project could have a negative impact.

(+) John C. Carney

"The project would involve no construction on the reservoir side of the dam."
The following language has been added to the water quality description:

150 GOLDEN GATE AVENUE- north side between Jones and Leavenworth Streets, in Assessor's Block 344, Lot 4.  Request for a Conditional Use authorization to construct a building exceeding 40 feet in height in an R (Residential) District, to determine an appropriate setback at the top portion of the front of the façade of the proposed building, and to allow an Institutional Use in an RC (Residential Commercial Combined) District.  The subject property is zoned RC-4 (Residential-Commercial, Combined, High Density) District, is in the North of Market Special Use District, and is in an 80-120-T Height and Bulk District.   The proposal is to demolish an existing four-story, approximately 88-foot high vacant building originally used as a lodge building for the Knights of Columbus, and most recently as office space.  The existing building would be replaced with a new five-story, approximately 78'-0" high building that would house administrative and some on-site service functions of the St. Anthony Foundation which provides a variety of services to homeless and other disadvantaged individuals.  The proposed facility at 150 Golden Gate would function as part of a larger campus of St. Anthony's and would specifically provide space for administrative offices, counseling, health and job training services, and, temporarily, some dining services, until a new dining and residential structure could be constructed across the street.

- Most of his customers come from tourists.

SPEAKER(S):
Re:  Continuance
Marilyn Amini
- It is very important that the Commission continue this item because there has been inadequate notice.  A lot of people do not know that this item is on the agenda.
- There have been eight neighborhoods that have been included in the Better Neighborhoods Program, but there are a lot of other communities that have not been included.
- This is something that has major impacts and the citizens of San Francisco need to be able to respond to this.
- When there are cumulative negative affects, there should be an EIR issued.

Joyce Calagos - San Francisco Organizing Project
- Housing is imperative in San Francisco.
- There is a great need for senior housing.
- She would like to speed up this process.
Hiroshi Fukuda
- There is more updated information/data on housing that the housing element could be based on.
- If the housing element is based on not updated information, everything will start wrong.
- "Garbage in, garbage out"
- This document needs to be redone and projections need to be redone.
Ramona Albright
- The state mandated targets need to be revisited.
- Even though Prop M is always being violated, it should still be kept in mind.
Chris Durazo - South of Market Community Action Network

Ada Chan - Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition
- She is here to support the approval and the timing of the housing element.
- It is nice to see on paper all the issues they have been presenting to the Planning Commission.

Stephen Johns
- He would like to ask why so many people were not noticed and urged that [staff/commission] try to fix this problem in the future.

- The July 1 deadline is not enough time to notify everyone in the City.
David Lupo - Carpenters Union

- The housing element is silent on how housing will be developed.
- The housing element avoids differentiating between renting and ownership.

- Parking and traffic has become a real issue in the City.
- Public transportation has been denied in San Francisco.
Joe Butler, AIA
- He is concerned with affordable housing and retaining sound housing.
- Part of the reason people are being driven away from San Francisco is the demolition of sound affordable housing.
- Putting new housing in neighborhood commercial districts is a good idea.
Joe O'Donaghue
- Why have we not gotten affordable housing or housing in general?  That is the question that needs to be addressed.
- The reason why we have not met all the residents' needs, is because as we downzone the city, as we put restrictions on demolitions, and create moratoriums and put builders out of work, the affordability decreases.
- The problem is also that we are looking at the wrong model and this is bringing the City into bankruptcy.
Donna Crowder
- More homeownership opportunities need to be added in the housing element.

did not state name
- He does not know how San Francisco will be able to do reasonable housing.
- The prior policy up until now is not working.  That is why the City is in this situation.
- Realistic planning needs to be developed to come up with the results this report states.
Sean Gorman, AIA
- San Francisco is currently running a deficit of about 1,000 units per year.
- Cities evolve, so housing needs to be produced.  There are a lot of ways to do it.
- There is a flaw in the document because it states that there is no more need for market rate housing.
- The deficit has been going on for many years.
- Going forward, there is a need for a lot of housing.  It is important to educate people that the quality of life in San Francisco depends on affordable housing.
(name unclear)

- The supply of housing needs to be increased.

Ron Lietky
- The housing element does not deal with the diversity of the neighborhoods in San Francisco.
- There are days and nights when he cannot park his car.
Lou Robanno
- His issue is the length of time it takes a permit to be issued in San Francisco.
- Nothing seems to be done about this.
- Buildings do wear out.
- Subsidized housing should be allowed on vacant lots.
Marilou Lescarry
- She is glad that the Commission supports public comment for as long as it takes.
- The copies of this document at local libraries are to be read there and cannot be taken home.
- She wanted to get more than two copies of the document but was not allowed.
- She volunteers to come to the Planning Department and take as many copies as she is allowed and distribute them to local organizations.
- This documentation needs to be in front of people.
Archie Kipenty
- He is a developer and has been developing in San Francisco for many years.
- It is just absolutely impossible to build affordable housing in San Francisco.

- This needs to be taken back to get more information.

Steven Hiello
- The Commission has a very difficult job.
- The process of getting a permit in San Francisco is ridiculously difficult--like Discretionary Reviews.

H. PUBLIC COMMENT
At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public comment, the commission is limited to:
(1)  responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or
(2)  requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or
(3)  directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.  (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))
