RACIAL AND SOCIAL EQUITY ACTION PLAN – Staff will present the updated Department’s 
Racial & Social Equity Action Plan, Phase I Adoption. The Plan contains goals, objectives 
and specific actions the Department will undertake to advance racial and social equity in 
our internal functions as well as a draft Implementation matrix. Phase II will focus on the 
external functions of the Department and will be recommended for adoption in late 2020. 
Both Phase I and Phase II will contain the Department’s commitments to advance racial 
and social equity: (1) internally as a workplace and (2) externally through our plans, 
policies and processes; and (3) ongoing implementation and monitoring mechanisms for 
accountability. All city departments are participating in the Government Alliance on Race 
and Equity under leadership from San Francisco’s Human Rights Commission and are 
undertaking similar Action Plans in accordance with the requirements of the newly formed 
Office of Racial Equity by Board Ordinance 188-19. Per the ordinance, Action Plans must be 
updated every three years from adoption.

CALLE 24 SPECIAL AREA DESIGN GUIDELINES – parcels within NC and NCT Zoning Districts, 
generally bounded by 22nd Street to the north, San Bruno Avenue to the east, Cesar Chavez 
Street to the south, and Bartlett Street to the west. Adoption of proposed Calle 24 Special 
Area Design Guidelines (SADGs), which are intended to supplement the City’s Urban 
Design Guidelines and help ensure that new development and remodeled building facades 
complement existing neighborhood character and patterns of development. The proposed 
boundary for the SADGs roughly corresponds to the Calle 24 Special Use District (SUD), 
which was adopted by the City in 2017. The SUD created a unique set of commercial 
zoning regulations intended to preserve and enhance the unique character of the Calle 24 
Latino Cultural District (established by the City in 2014) and recognize Latino cultural 
heritage. The Calle 24 SADGs will further the SUD’s intent through guidelines that address 
architectural design, artwork, and other elements of the physical environment. They will 
be used by project sponsors, the community, Planning design review staff, and the 
Planning Commission to help evaluate proposed project designs to ensure preservation of 
defining neighborhood characteristics while accommodating new development.
