SPEAKER(S):
Mary Burns - President of the Greater West Portal Neighborhood Association

- A six-fold increase in the application fee is highly inappropriate and will affect various neighborhoods negatively.
Steve Vettel
- The fee increases proposed is about 316 percent over existing fees.
- The fees that are being proposed for moderate size projects is enormous.
- He does not know where the money is going, the problem is not fees.  The problem is that there are not enough employees to fill positions.
- What is being proposed is not even close to reality.
- He requests that these numbers be looked again before next week.
Joe O'Donoghue
- He echoes the previous speakers comments.
- If the document presented came from a CPA it would make no sense.
- Are the planners really functioning at their best level?
- A General Motors type of accounting system should be taken into consideration.
- Staff needs to assure the public that the fees they are paying are well managed.
