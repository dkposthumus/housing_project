Financial Analysis of the financial viability of SB-9 development scenarios 
and it would be done in late October. Isn’t this necessary information before 
proceeding with these Code Amendments? The Citywide Cultural 
Resources Survey is underway and ongoing and will not be completed until 
2026? Isn’t this necessary information, particularly since it is looking 
through the lens of equity issues and what structures can be Demolished? 
The Residential Design Guidelines as currently written are not subjective. 
They have been formally in place since 2003 and were developed in the 
years prior to that. They are extensive. They are in the Planning Code under 
Section 311. If you read the introduction to them it seems clear that they 
are objective standards to be applied to projects in the RH Districts.
