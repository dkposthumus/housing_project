Preliminary Recommendation:  Approve the draft resolution recommending to the Board of Supervisors that the proposed ordinance be adopted as presented.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Patricia Vaughey
- There are no enforcement fees.
- The biggest problem in the Planning Department is that there is a lack of enforcement.
- Senior Citizens own a lot of property in San Francisco but they cannot afford to pay Discretionary Review fees.
- Many of the neighborhood activists seem to be taking on the task of enforcement instead of the Planning Department.
(-) Tom McDonough
- He owns a solar energy company.
- There is need to use technology more.
- It is very expensive to do business in San Francisco.
- This should be more efficient and streamlined.
(-) Kirk Scott
- He is concerned with Discretionary Review fees and building permit fees.

- What kinds of benefits accrue?  Community benefits or individual benefits?
(+) Joe O'Donaghue
- Developers are not being impacted directly; it is the consumer.
- One of the things that the Commission should be taking into consideration is the incredible cost that the Board of Supervisors has imposed on the Commission without any cost benefit to the Commission or any cost reimbursement.
- The Board of Supervisors have become a defacto Planning Commission.
(-) Maria Souza
- She is concerned with the increase of Discretionary Review fees because many of the residents of the Richmond District have fixed incomes.
- She suggested that if a DR project prevails, they should be the ones to carry out the fees.
- If fees will be increased, this will create an incentive to approve those project and those issues.
(-) Marilyn Amini
- She is concerned about Discretionary Reviews.
- It is unfair for people who cannot afford to pay the increase in fees.
ACTION: Approved as Amended: The Ordinance Discretionary Review language was amended to state that the Department will charge $200 for the first two hours of staff time.

Preliminary Recommendation:  Approve resolution recommending the Board of Supervisors adopt the draft ordinance and the associated Planning Code text amendments.

Re:  Continuance

- She believes that this case should be continued because this item was advertised to be hard in the Board of Supervisor's Chambers.
- There are a lot of graduations today and people might not be able to come to the hearing.
Re:  Merits of Case
George Williams - SPUR
- SPUR has been working with the Planning Department to approve policies that meet the needs of the City of San Francisco.
- SPUR supports the final draft of the Housing Element.
- SPUR requests that the Planning Commission approve the housing element and the rezoning efforts.
Susan Vaughn
- She is representing Transportation for a Livable City.
- She is in support of the Housing Element because there is a lot in this document that provide solutions to problems and issues facing the City.
Patricia Vaughey
- Before the Planning Commission passes this Housing Element it should be changed back to what it was.
- The affordable housing issue should be straightened out.
- It is important to look at what the City is doing and what the City is doing wrong and then start correcting and implementing.
Penelope Clark
- She lives on Russian Hill.
- Sites with heavy density and no parking already exist throughout the City.
- People have lives outside of what public transportation can provide.
- Providing parking more efficiently is a very important issue.
- If this is not looked at it will seriously damage the quality of life in San Francisco.
Pat Devlieg
- She lives in the Excelsior District.  She uses public transportation a lot.
- The density in this district is increasing without having more developments.
- She feels that people are stuck in a "parking hell."
- For neighborhoods to restrict the amount of parking and construct developments without parking will be damaging to the City.
- There should be some accommodation for affordable housing but the proposal is too dense.
Ernestine Weiss
- She has been preaching about affordable housing for a long time.
- She suggests building housing along the transit corridors.
- She feels that this can be done.
- This City will be a ghost town if all this planning is not implemented soon.
Joe O'Donaghue
- If this Housing Element is implemented it will be a disaster.
- Where are the subsidies going to come out of?
- It is important to calculate formulas and not set projections on hopes and ideas.
Grace Kiely
- She feels that there are flaws in the Housing Element.
- No research has been done on where people that have left the City have moved.

- This document needs to be looked at more closely.
Richie Hart

- It is important to go back to density and not provide so much parking.
Redmond Lyons
- This policy and objective has failed for about 30 years.

Dave O'Keefe
- He is a small builder in San Francisco.
- It is pretty clear that the policies in the past that were implemented did not work, otherwise this item would not be before the Commission.

- If this document is passed the way it is, the Commission will have hearings until midnight.
Aurora Grajeda - Mission Agenda
