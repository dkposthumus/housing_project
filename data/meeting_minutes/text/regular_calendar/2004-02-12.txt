PLANNING DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSED WORK PROGRAM AND BUDGET FOR FY 2004-2005- Presentation of the San Francisco Planning Department Work Program and Budget, and consideration of approval of a draft resolution adopting the Planning Department's proposed work program and budget for fiscal year 2004-2005.
Preliminary Recommendation: Approval
SPEAKER(S):
Alexis Harte - Coordinator of the Urban Forest Council
- Council members represent full range of organizations.
- Staff member Ann Marie Rogers is vital in urban forest planning.
- 2004 will be an extremely difficult fiscal year.
- He is asking the support from the Planning Commission to request funds for this issue.
- The Urban Forest Council and the Department of the Environment are eager to work together with the Planning Department and Planning Commission.
Patricia Voughey
- She feels that the important thing is efficiency.
- There are certain planners who the public can really know when to get a hold of.
- There are a lot of ways to be efficient.
- The computer systems at the Planning Department should have the Building Department application lookup systems on their computers.  This would allow the planners to look up all the information on a certain block/lot.
- This would eliminate the public to have to call back and call back.
Lois Scott - Local 21 - Professional and Technical Engineers
- This is a very clear and understandable work program.
- The area of weakness would be on how the department is doing.
- There is not much information on how much "backlog" there is.
- To be a better performance document, the targets need a baseline.
- It would be helpful to put "percentage complete" and "percentage proposed".
- Cost recovery would be very minimal.
- She proposes to work together on the targets and develop more specific targets.
Kate White - San Francisco Housing Coalition
- She congratulated staff on putting this budget information together.
- She seconded all the comments from the Commission on obtaining funds from the general fund.
- She expressed her support and that of the coalition for this.
- There is one big hole she is very concerned about:  EIR money for the Better Neighborhoods Plans.
- These plans have a tremendous amount of community consensus.
- With all the support from the public, it is a shame if there is no money for these plans.
Terry Milmne - Bernal Heights
- He seconded what the first speaker said.
- Ms. Ann Marie Rodgers is a very important member in the Urban Forest Council.
- Planning is something that drives the whole City and all the money Planning needs should be provided as soon as possible.
- He suggested to anyone who is listening to transmit this information to the Mayor.

Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.

- The neighborhood needs controls.
Cris Selig - MAC
- She appreciates that the Commission is listening to testimony again.
- The Mission District needs controls.
- There is a split around the issue of controls and policies.
- The NEMIZ is very important to have controls as well.  They will set up a way to plan and look at the whole neighborhood together.
- Guidelines are too loose and leave it to developers who could afford to fight expensive battles.
- A plan should be instituted that will benefit the entire community and not just one lot.

- He is a third generation San Franciscan.
- He recently was disabled by a stroke.
- He has been living in a very small SRO hotel.

Mary Murphy - Farella, Braun and Martell
- She represents Bay West Corporation who is the owner and developer of most of the designer showrooms for the Showplace Square District.

- The City does not have the authority under State law to pass controls.
- The findings on the resolutions are inadequate under State law which was recently amended to become far more stringent.
Jeffrey Lievobitz
- He is representing the South Beach/Rincon Point CAC and the SOMA Leadership Council.

These spaces mean opportunities to fill the City with the things that are important to them:  decent and affordable family-sized housing, good living-wage jobs, neighborhood-serving businesses, public open spaces and community services.
- The Planning Department allows permits to developers that could be used to protect uses that are vital to the City such as production, distribution and repair services.

- Interim controls are important because they guide development.
- Interim controls reduce the need to avoid development projects on a case by case basis.
- She requests revisions to the map of Showplace Square/Potrero. Some of the areas on the map should be changed from housing/mixed use to housing/PDR.

- There is no affordable housing component in the document.
- They have been fighting for so long and so hard for permanent zoning in order to protect them.
Joe Boz
- There are various areas that have various requirements.  Each one should be looked at separately.
- It is best to pass interim controls in Showplace Square and move into environmental rather quickly.
- It is important to split them into three and do the right thing.
Shawn Gorman
- The Showplace square was brought up before the Land Use Committee in November of last year.
- The area along 17thStreet calls for NC.  All the community maps called for NC along there.

Alice Barkley

- He supports interim policies because it will free up opportunity for small businesses.
- This area has changed dramatically with residential and there is a desperate need for small businesses.
Sean Kiegran

- All three plans put forward by the neighborhood groups call for neighborhood commercial.
- Who wants PDR across from a park?
18.   (M. CHION: (415) 558-6314)
CONSIDERATION OF ADOPTION OF INTERIM POLICIES OR A RESOLUTION OF INTENT TO ADOPT INTERIM CONTROLS FOR SECTIONS OF THE EASTERN NEIGHBORHOODS: Mission (generally bounded by Guerrero, Division, Potrero, and Cesar Chavez Streets), SoMa (generally bounded by Mission, 7thStreet, Freeway 80, 4thStreet, the Embarcadero, and Folsom), and Showplace Square (generally bounded by 7th, Bryant, Potrero and 25thStreets). Public hearing on the adoption of interim policies or a resolution of intent to adopt interim zoning controls that would establish areas for Housing and Mixed Use, Core PDR, and Housing/PDR in sections of the Mission, South of Market and Showplace Square. The Housing and Mixed Use zoning overlay will encourage residential development; the Core PDR zoning overlay will primarily support production, distribution and repair activities; and the Housing/PDR zoning overlay will promote a mix of residential and other uses while preserving existing PDR space. The initiation of interim zoning controls would require the adoption of a resolution of intent to initiate that will enable the publication of a formal notice for a future public hearing at which hearing the Planning Commission would consider the adoption of interim controls.
(Continued from Regular Meeting of December 18, 2003)

G. PUBLIC COMMENT
At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.

Eric Quezada
Re:  Public Benefit Zoning
- This concept is about when rezoning happens in development by increasing density and give increased value to the landlords.
- Neighborhoods are entitled to recapture some of that value through public benefits in order to offset the impact of the added density.  This will ensure that the new development will contribute to creating complete vibrant and healthy neighborhoods.
- Public Benefit Incentive Zoning gives developers incentives to build good housing in neighborhoods while recognizing the need to preserve the cultural and economic diversity of San Francisco's neighborhoods.
- It will also be a more predictable real estate environment.
- This is what they will be pursuing.
Luis Granados
- He is very disappointed with Director Larry Badiner.
- Mr. Badiner has robbed the Department and has brought it to another low.
- He hopes that a new director is hired as soon as possible.
- Mr. Badiner has shown a lack of understanding for planning principals for political expediency.
- He is so upset with Commissioners Boyd and Bradford Bell.
