3150 18TH STREET- Lots 002 and 012 of Assessor's Block 3573, northwestern corner of 18th Street and Treat Avenue -Appeal of Preliminary Negative Declarationfor the proposed project would involve the demolition of a set of two-story light industrial office and warehouse buildings with six off-street parking spaces and construction of a five-story building consisting of approximately 260 units of rental workshops for arts activities, light manufacturing, repair and small business services uses and a single caretaker's unit.  The total floor area of the new building would be about 73,224 gsf. The second through fifth floors would be set back between approximately 12 and 16 feet over the 13-1/2 foot tall podium of the ground floor. The proposed building would be approximately 50 feet tall. Pedestrian access would be provided from Treat Avenue while vehicular access would be provided from 18th Street to a ground level garage with 50 off-street parking spaces, a single loading space and six bicycle spaces.  The project site is in an M-1 (Light Industrial) Zoning District, and a 50-X height and bulk district.  It is also within the Eastern Neighborhoods study area.
Preliminary Recommendation: Uphold Preliminary Negative Declaration.
(Continued from Regular Meeting of May 13, 2004)
SPEAKER (S):
Kelly Saranger, Appellant
- Our community is not against this project.
- What we are opposed to is the potential for negative environmental effects because of the massive scale and size of this building.
- There are 130 cubicle spaces, which are intended for various artists to use, pointed directly toward our building, which is a live-work space.  We are there 24/7, and there is the potential for air and water pollution because of these non-ventilated units as the current design suggests.  The only ventilation for these units is the window that is pointed toward us.  So we would assume that there would be fans that could blow fumes into our community.
-    Also concerned about the noise and traffic.
Bruce Cree, Appellant
- There will be negative environmental impacts.
- The area where we are living is changing.  It is his opinion that if there are going to be more buildings, they should be built with the character of the existing building.
-     It is a very massive building.
-     We as a community are not in favor of this kind of building.
Steve Vettel, representing Project Sponsor
- There is not a need for an EIR.
- This project is located in a PDR area.
- Parking is more than adequate to meet the demand credit by this project.
-     Urged the Commission to uphold the Negative Declaration.
Jillian Jerome
- I am speaking to you as the Chief gardener of the Box Factory.
-    Should this project be constructed, it will cause serious damage to the garden.
-     It is my opinion that the proposed project be submitted for an extensive EIR.
Michael Woo
-  I am here to speak about concern for the air quality.
-  Feels that they are going to build too many units.
Christina (last name unclear)
-     Concerned about safety and health
- There is a huge brick wall that separates the Box Factory and the new project
- This wall provides a lot of security and makes her place safe.
-     Fumes would be coming toward our place.
Ron Sland
-  His main concern is the size of the building, noise, pollution, fumes, and shadowing.

There will be no physical expansion of the existing building.
Preliminary Recommendation: Approve with conditions
SPEAKER (S):
Mike Eaglesen,Project Sponsor
- Trying my best to make my business profitable.  That is why I am making a request for Conditional Use.
- Everyone who patronizes our establishment would like us to have some kind of entertainment.
- We are a coffee shop/restaurant.  We serve Russian food and pastries.  We are not a dance club.
- It is very hard to compete with the rest of the restaurants in the North Beach area.
-     If we do not add to our establishment, we will simply be driven out.
Brad Willmore, Telegraph Hill Dwellers.
- Adamantly opposed to this application.
- Their liquor license is a type 41 that is specifically for a restaurant.  What we have is a bar--a techno bar.  They are not open for breakfast.  They are not open for lunch.  They are not always open for dinner.  In fact, they are not open most days of the week.  They are open on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights to skim the high value dollar traffic off of the bridge, tunnel, and BART crowd that come in to the Broadway Business District as well as the Grant Avenue Business District.
- The Project Sponsor severely misrepresented his intentions when he appeared before our committee to get support/approval for a restaurant, and then shoe-horn that into a bar

- The project will maximize communication services while minimizing impacts on municipal services.
- This project will provide the elimination of fading, dropped calls, and poor reception in the Twin-Peaks. /Castro District.
Philip Colgan
- Opposed to the installation of antennas.
- The garage where the equipment is proposed to be has been broken into four times in the last two years.
- Security is very inadequate.
- As homeowners we would see an increase in insurance costs based on this equipment and other matters.
-     I'm also concerned about health issues.

Leo Medeiros
- Addressed the issue of property values.

Preliminary Recommendation:  Do not take Discretionary Review and approve demolition.
(Continued from Regular Meeting of May 27, 2004)
SPEAKER(S):
Larry McCoy, Discretionary Review Requestor
- The City has already stated that this house is a mistake.
-     The project would be much larger than the other houses in the neighborhood.
-     It is not in keeping with the character of the neighborhood.
Does not meet the residential guidelines.
- This project is not supported by the neighborhood.
Father Nazarin
-    Opposed the demolition.
Beth VanEman
- These houses would be out of character with the rest of the neighborhood.
- This project would destroy the open space character.
Mrs. .Anderson

- If the Commission does decide to approve this project, as a condition of approval it could be required that the applicant address the concerns of the neighbors--not just the hours of construction, but also the access to the street.  Valley is a very narrow street.
Alice Barkley
- When you start to remodel an existing building, you find that it will cost more per square foot by time you buy it and renovate it.  It cost more simply because our housing in the City is very old.

SPEAKER(S):
Larry Paul, Architect representing the DR requestor  -
- We agree to the four-story project. It should have a setback of 15 feet in accordance with the Residential Design Guidelines.
- The third story should be setback a little bit.
- The adjacent property is only 2 stories.
- The stucco base should be limited to just the first story, and the upper story should have wood siding rather than what is proposed.  It would help to meld this project into the character of the neighborhood.
- The rear deck--this is a big issue of privacy
- It does not meet the residential guidelines
- There is definitely a need for a construction management plan to be put into place that would restrict construction just to the weekdays, maybe 8 am to 4 pm.
- There should also be a provision for the parking.  This is a very tiny cul-de-sac and there is very little parking on the street.
Christine Hansen
-    Does not object to the building of this house.
- The issue is the project sponsor's non-response.  We have constantly been ignored.
- The property is on a cul-de-sac and we have concerns about the tightness of the area.

-     Gave a description of the project.
Joe O'Donoghue
-      This project will be a great asset to this neighborhood.

2) To be consistent with the neighborhood character, install stucco work only at the base of the building (garage level) and horizontal wood siding at the first, second, and third floors (top three levels);
3) To ensure maximum privacy to the neighboring houses at 590 Oak Park Drive, provide screening and privacy mechanism for the deck above grade (first floor);
4) To ensure quite time for existing residents and safety of children playing in the cul-de-sac, limit the hours of construction from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Fridays only; and
5) To add more visual and architectural interest, provide 3 inch reveals for all windows visible from the public street.

Dennis Budd, Project Sponsor
- Majority of the homes in our neighborhood are two-stories, averaging 22' to 25' in height at the street façade.
- There are 4 large trees in the area of the backyard where Planning had recommended we do a horizontal addition.
- A horizontal addition would require twenty-five lineal feet of 6' high retaining wall on both property lines.
- A horizontal addition would eliminate the light, air and rear-yard views from our current kitchen and family room.
- We have signatures of support from 24 neighbors
- We have reviewed the published Residential Design Guidelines and find that our project conforms in the following ways:
o Providing mixed visual character and architectural style
o Providing setback height
o Minimizing impacts on light and privacy
o Preserving the lot and block pattern
o Maintaining mid-block open space
ACTION: The Commission stated that the top story was unacceptable and directed the sponsor to explore options that would eliminate the top floor and find another location for the displaced floor area.  The matter was continued to September 23, 2004 by a vote +5 -0.
