HOUSING FOR ALL – Informational Presentation on implementation of the recently 
adopted Housing Element. In January 2023, the City & County of San Francisco adopted a 
new Housing Element, grounded in equity. This ambitious policy document contains over 
350 implementation actions. Guided by Mayor London N. Breed's "Housing for All" 
strategy, the Mayor’s Office is leading the Interagency Housing Implementation Group 
with City agencies to deliver these actions. This presentation will review the Planning 
Department’s pending work alongside government agencies, community-based 
organizations, and residents to realize the Housing Element’s vision. The Department’s 
efforts are organized around four topic areas: 1) Activating Community Priorities; 2) 
Expanding Housing Choice; 3) Housing Production and Process Improvements; and 4) 
Affordable Housing Funding and Strategies. 
Preliminary Recommendation: None - Informational

- Georgia Schuttish – Take care before eviscerating Section 317 whether 
for Conditional Use or unit merger which is why I keep submitting info 
about codifying the Residential Flat Policy to preserve Flats in their 
existing and original configuration to prevent high-end market-rate, 
single family homes, but maintain denser, missing middle homes. If the 
Demo Calcs had been adjusted (which is a market-based strategy) to 
better preserve housing rather than creating larger high-end homes 
masking as “Alterations”, the goal of the 2014 Housing Element to 
preserve “starter homes” could have been better realized, instead of now 
being abandoned. Please look at page 14, the three paragraphs on SB 9 on 
the Department’s October 21, 2021 Memo by Ms. Conner and Ms. 
Nickolopoulos that expresses worries about existing owners, “cashing-
