50 OAK STREET, SAN FRANCISCO CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC- Certification of Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) -The proposed project is the seismic upgrade and major alteration of the existing four- to five- story Category II, Significant Building at 50 Oak Street, and demolition of the adjacent three- to four- story building and new construction of a six-story structure at 70 Oak Street, for the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.  The two structures would be combined into one, structurally integrated facility. The two existing buildings total about 91,000 gsf.  The Conservatory of Music would contain about 125,000 gsf, including about 19,200 gsf of performance space; 17,000 gsf of performing support space; 26,500 gsf of educational studios and spaces; 7,500 gsf of administrative office pace; 7,000 gsf of library space; 21,600 gsf of corridor and circulation space; and 26,200 gsf of service and storage space. Of the total area, about 98,500 gsf are applicable to the FAR under the Planning Code. No parking spaces or loading spaces are proposed.  The site occupies the north side of Oak Street, between the 25 Van Ness Avenue building and a parking lot at Hickory and Franklin Street, encompassing most of the half block bounded by Oak, Hickory, and Franklin Streets and Van Ness Avenue.  The site includes Lots 5 and 7, in Assessor's Block 834.  While the project would function as one building, it would appear as two buildings from Oak Street.  The project requires a lot line adjustment to merge the existing lots; a Permit to Alter for 50 Oak Street, a Category II, Significant Building, under Planning Code, Article 11; review of substantial alterations to existing buildings in the C-3 Districts under Section 309, including a request for exceptions to bulk limits (for maximum building length and maximum diagonal dimension), and a revocable encroachment permit from the Department of Public Works, to occupy sub sidewalk vaults.
Preliminary Recommendation:  Certify the EIR.  Please note that the public review period for the Draft EIR ended at 5 pm, January 23, 2003.

(Continued from Regular Meeting of April 3, 2003)
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Erika Tarantino
- She spoke last time and would like to emphasize that this is the sixth continuance.
- She cannot understand why Verizon cannot get their documents together.
- She feels that this is just a tactic.
- All the surrounding neighbors are against this installation.
- The neighbors are against the antennas, the panels, and the 12 equipment cabinets that will be 8 feet tall.  And finally, they are against the fans that will make a lot of noise.
(-) Barbara Janeff
- She feels that there is no need for these antennas since there are five other carriers in the area.
- There is also no desire for these antennas either.  She has many signatures of people who are against the installation.
- Regarding compatibility, the equipment will be over built and over bulky.
(-) Kenneth Thompson - Beach/Buchanan Home Owners Association
- He lives on Beach Street.  He is also president of the Homeowners Association of the building he lives in.
- Everyone in the building is opposed to this installation.
- Regarding coverage and need:  He and his wife have Verizon cell phones and they work perfectly well in the area.
- All of the neighbors are concerned about the noise the fans will make.
(-) Robert Wales
- He lives on Beach Street.
- He displayed a map of where he lives and where the antennas are proposed to be installed.
- The maps that they received from Verizon are not supported by data.
- He has two Verizon phones and he has never had dropped calls so he really questions coverage.
- There is a question of integrity and corporate irresponsibility.
(-) Christine Varon
- She lives on Beach Street.
- Her daughter has been diagnosed with a devastating neurological condition that is very rare.
- She has read through packages of possible health concerns.
- She understand that this is not submittable but her daughter lives within 200 feet of where these towers are supposed to be.  She knows of other children who live near by.
- She knows that children are very susceptible to health concerns because of their developing nervous system.
- She has a Verizon phone and it works perfectly.
(-) Jacqueline K. Clemens
- She and her husband are part of the Beach Street Homeowners Association.
- Everyone in the apartment building they live in is opposed to this installation.
- She hopes that the Commission will hear everyone that is here today and not grant this approval.
- The neighbors are concerned with the protrusion of these antennas and equipment and the noise they will make.
(-) Sandra Schaefer - Pacific Union Real Estate
- She has about 20 real estate agents and they all have cell phones that work just fine.
- All their clients feel that she owns the building.
- She is concerned about the noise because her office is on the fourth floor and right next to the antennas.
(+) Eric Guarisco
- He lives on Northpoint Street.
- He feels that there is an issue of capacity.
- The capacity/coverage could be better.
- He cannot understand how in a City like San Francisco we do not have better cell phone service.
(-) Doug Loranger - SNAFU
- He read a statement from Bill Sanders, Deputy City Attorney which stated that in the Planning Code, necessity and desirability speak to the neighborhood and community's desire, and not Verizon's.
- Verizon needs to answer all of the questions stated here.
- He read Section 707 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, it states that local government should not prohibit or have the affect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services.  No Federal Appeals court has made any determination on the two issues put before the Commission:  capacity and next generation of wireless services.
- There is no data that shows that any of the neighbors of this area want or need these antennas.
- He would like to have this application denied today and not continued.
(-) Mark Longwood
- Two years ago, the Planning Department put together an inventory of antennas in San Francisco.  Even incomplete, these antennas numbered 2,400 then.  That is one antenna for about 333 people in this City.
- It is not uncommon for an antenna to have a coverage area of up to 20 square blocks.  How many people occupy 20 square blocks?
- Each application ranges from about 5 antennas each.
- At each meeting, most of the people against the installation are greater than those who are in support.
(+) Bill Hammet - Hammet and Edison
- He stated that he is speaking now because he will not be able to come back in two weeks.
- He spoke about data in reports submitted to the Health Department.
- He presented data which is in exact agreement with his report and that of the Health Department.
(+) Bill Wilson
- He read a letter from John Williams who is opposed to this application.
