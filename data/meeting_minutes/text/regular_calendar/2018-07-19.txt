FEES FOR CERTAIN PERMIT AND TRANSPORTATION ANALYSIS – This proposed Resolution 
details the fee legislation that was considered as part of the Planning Department’s Fiscal 
Years 2018-19 and 2019-20 budget. The legislation was discussed and recommended for 
approval by the Planning Commission as part of the budget in Resolution 20103. However, 
Resolution No. 20103 did not include Findings of Consistency with the General Plan and 
the Eight Priority Policies of Planning Code Section 101.1 necessary to amend the Planning 
Code. The proposed Planning Code Amendment and the fees set forth in Ordinance No. 
149-16 to clarify the fees applicable to projects with no or very low construction cost and 
to change the fees for transportation analysis; and affirm the Planning Department’s 
determination under the California Environmental Quality Act, make findings of 
consistency with the General Plan, and the eight priority policies of Planning Code, Section 
101.1, and adopt findings of public necessity, convenience, and welfare under Planning 
Code, Section 302.  
Preliminary Recommendation: Approve
