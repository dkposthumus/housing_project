1201 SUTTER STREET – south side between Polk Street and Van Ness Avenue; Lot 001 in 
Assessor’s Block 0691 (District 3) – Request for Commission Review, pursuant to Planning 
Code Section 415.5(g)(2), to change the Project’s means of compliance with the Inclusionary 
Affordable Housing Program (Section 415). The Project involves a newly constructed six-
story, mixed-use building containing 54 dwelling units located above ground-floor retail. 
The Project was approved with 51 studios and three (3) two-bedroom units, with eight (8) 
affordable (or below market rate) units provided on-site. The Project now proposes to 
change the means of compliance with Section 415, from the On-Site Affordable Housing 
Alternative to payment of the Affordable Housing Fee. The Project would also convert eight 
(8) studios to one-bedroom units, resulting in a revised dwelling unit mix of 43 studios, eight 
(8) one-bedroom units, and three (3) two-bedroom units (still totaling 54 dwelling units). 
No other changes are proposed to the Project. The Project was issued a Rear Yard 
Modification Decision on December 11, 2017 (Case No. 2014-001674VAR), and the Planning 
Department subsequently approved the Project in January of 2018. The proposal to modify 
the Project’s means of compliance with the Inclusionary Affordable Housing Program would 
not constitute a substantial modification of the Project under the California Environmental 
Quality Act (“CEQA”), as defined by San Francisco Administrative Code Section 31.08(i). 
Therefore, a reevaluation of the Project in accordance with San Francisco Administrative 
Code Section 31.19, for the purposes of CEQA, is not required. 
Preliminary Recommendation:  Adopt Findings
