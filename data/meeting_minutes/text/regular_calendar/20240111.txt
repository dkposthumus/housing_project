Potrero Yard Modernization Project (2500 Mariposa Street) – Certification of the Final Environmental Impact 
Report (EIR) – The project site is located on the entire block bounded by 17th to the north, Hampshire Street to 
the east, Mariposa Street to the south, and Bryant Street to the west (Assessor’s block/lot 3971/001). The 
proposed project would demolish the existing SFMTA Potrero Trolley Coach Division Facility (Potrero Yard), a 
California Register of Historic Resources–eligible historic resource and replace it with an expanded and 
modernized transit facility. The project would include SFMTA bus parking and circulation (up to 213 buses); 
SFMTA maintenance, operation, and administrative uses; and joint development (residential and commercial)

uses as part of a joint development program between SFMTA and a private project co-sponsor. The 
approximately 1,250,000-gross-square-foot structure would rise to heights ranging from 70 to 150 feet across 
the site. It would contain a four-level (including mezzanine level), approximately 70-foot-tall replacement transit 
facility (700,000 gross square feet) plus a joint development with a mix of commercial (3,000 gross square feet) 
and residential uses (up to 530,000 gross square feet and 513 units). The majority of residential development 
would be atop the replacement transit facility on floors 7 seven through 13. A Paratransit Variant is also proposed, 
which would construct Bryant Street family housing (103 units) but replace the remainder of the podium housing 
with SFMTA’s Paratransit Operations. The project site is located within a P (Public) Zoning District and 65-X 
Height and Bulk District.

ISLAIS CREEK BRIDGE PROJECT – The Islais Creek Bridge is located on Third Street over the Islais Creek channel in 
San Francisco’s Bayview neighborhood. Review and Comment before the Planning Commission on the Draft 
Environmental Impact Report for the proposed project. The City and County of San Francisco is proposing to 
replace the existing Islais Creek Bridge along Third Street in San Francisco. The existing bridge is structurally 
deteriorated and seismically deficient. The proposed replacement bridge would meet current structural and 
seismic standards, accommodate new transit tracks, travel lanes for private vehicles, two pedestrian/bicycle 
paths, and would be resilient to predicted sea-level-rise impacts. Construction is estimated to be approximately 
24 months and would begin no sooner than spring 2025. Public comment for this DEIR is from November 30, 
2023, till 5:00PM on January 22, 2024. The areas adjacent to the project site are in the Production, Distribution, 
and Repairs (PDR-2) and Heavy Industrial (M-2) Zoning Use Districts.
