WATERFRONT RESILIENCE PROGRAM – Informational Presentation – Staff will provide an 
update on the Waterfront Resilience Program (“WRP”) which works to ensure the 
waterfront, and its critical regional and citywide assets, are resilient to hazards and 
increasingly accessible to everyone it serves. Since 2018, the WRP has achieved several key 
milestones towards developing a more resilient waterfront, including: completion of the 
Multi-Hazard Risk Assessment, launch of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers San Francisco 
Waterfront Coastal Flood Study, development of Draft WRP program goals, development 
of seismic and flood measures, and identification of early projects for the Embarcadero 
Seawall. The Department supported and collaborated with the Port of San Francisco (in 
partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other city agencies) to develop 
seven Draft Waterfront Adaptation Strategies (Alternatives) (“Strategies”) based on over 
five years of public engagement. The informational presentation will describe the seven 
Strategies. The Strategies are options to be evaluated that reduce flood and seismic risk 
along the waterfront. Following this presentation, the Strategies will be presented to the 
public for feedback and will be evaluated across a range of technical measures with a goal
