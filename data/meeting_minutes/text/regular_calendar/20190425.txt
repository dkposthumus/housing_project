POTRERO POWER STATION – the area generally bounded by Illinois Street on the west, 23rd 
Street on the south San Francisco Bay on the East, and 22nd Street on the north, Assessor’s 
Block and Lots: 4175/002; 4175/017; 4175/018; 4232/001; 4232/006; and non-assessed 
Port and City/County of San Francisco properties (District 10). This is an Informational 
Presentation on the proposed Potrero Power Station Mixed-Use Development Project, 
located in the Central Waterfront at the site of the former power station decommissioned 
in 2011 by then-owner Mirant Potrero LLC. Associate Capital, the project sponsor, seeks to 
redevelop the ~29-acre site for a multi-phased, mixed-use development, and activate a 
new waterfront open space. The proposed project would rezone the site, establish land use 
controls, develop design standards, and provide for development of residential, 
commercial (including office, research and development/life science, retail, hotel, and 
production, distribution, and repair), parking, community facilities, and open space land 
uses. The proposed project would include amendments to the General Plan and Planning 
Code, creating a new Potrero Power Station Special Use District. The proposed rezoning 
would modify the existing height limits of 40 and 65 feet to various heights ranging from 
65 to 300 feet. Overall, the proposed project would construct up to approximately 5.3 
million gross square feet (gsf) of uses.
