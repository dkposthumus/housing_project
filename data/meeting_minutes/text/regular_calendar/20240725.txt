199 FREMONT STREET / 342 HOWARD STREET – northeast corner of Fremont Street and Howard Street; Lot 018 
in Assessor’s Block 3719 (District 6) – Request to rescind Condition of Approval 2(H) from Office Allocation Motion 
No. 13218 (Planning Department Record No. 89.589B) pursuant to Planning Code Section 414.12 to allow for the 
removal of an existing on-site childcare facility that was provided as part of an Office Allocation for an office 
development located at 300 Howard Street, now known as 199 Fremont Street, within a C-3-0(SD)  (Downtown-
Office (Special Development)) Zoning District and 700-S-2 Height and Bulk District. That office development was 
approved by the Planning Commission on December 5, 1991, and the required on-site childcare facility located 
on the third floor and rooftop of the adjacent building located at 342 Howard Street began operating in October 
2000 and operated for approximately 21 years, or until August 2021, when the operator of the childcare center 
voluntarily closed the location. Pursuant to Planning Code Section 414.12, the Project Sponsor may apply to the 
Planning Department to eliminate the childcare facility or to reduce the floor area of the childcare facility in any 
amount, as long as the childcare facility has been provided for more than five years after the issuance of the first 
certificate of occupancy for the Project. Since the childcare center located at 342 Howard Street operated for 
approximately 21 years, the Project is eligible to request the removal of the existing childcare facility and is not 
subject to any associated in-lieu fees.
