SECTION 295 POLICIES AND METHODOLOGY- Review of Planning Code Section 295 ("The Sunlight Ordinance"), and a discussion of the Department's technical methodology for shadow impact analysis.
Preliminary Recommendation:  Informational presentation, no action required.
SPEAKER(S):
(+/-) Jeffrey Heller
- In his view Proposition K is a good thing.
- The main issue here is to ask what is substantial and what is not?
- On any certain part of the day, shadows can be significant.
- The shadow formula does not take into account trees, etc.
- There should be a proper threshold of analysis so that the evaluation is meaningful.
(-) Adina Rosemarin
- She is director of a small park near Stonestown.
- She has factual experience of the operation of this criteria.
- She has been working on the Stonestown project and under these criteria the shadow would be insignificant. Unfortunately, these criteria are entirely done by arithmetic, not actual.
ACTION: Public hearing closed.  No action required by the Commission
