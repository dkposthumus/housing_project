SPEAKERS:

= Veronica Flores – Staff report 
- Georgia Schuttish – See May 31st Schuttish email/pdf to Commission and
Staff. Issues raised in pdf on Safai four-plex Ordinance apply to this new
Ordinance. For example: Planning Department’s over “cashing out” as
discussed on page 14 of Executive Summary on SB9 dated October 21,
2021 and what this could mean for people of color and low-income
owners. This concern applies to this proposed Ordinance. Other issues: No
Noticing/No Appeal: No recourse to protect neighbors’ foundations during
Demolition. Ownership requirement of one year not enough to protect
from speculative development. Staff Report Recommendation eliminating
this requirement will guarantee speculative by developers. Sound housing
should not be demolished. Housing in the Avenues vulnerable. High-end
neighborhoods not. (i.e Balboa Terrace/St. Francis Wood/Ingleside
Terrace, etc) Review/Hearings on Breed/Melgar proposed Ordinance to
build housing on commercial/transit corridors per SF Chronicle 5/23/2023
should precede SUD Ordinance.

SAN FRANCISCO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT’S SHORELINE PROTECTION PROGRAM –
Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report (EIR) San Francisco International
Airport is proposing the Shoreline Protection Program, which would install a new shoreline
protection system around the Airport that would comply with current Federal Emergency
Management Administration requirements for flood protection against a 100-year flood
and would incorporate protection against future sea-level rise. The proposed project
would remove the existing shoreline protection features and construct a new shoreline
protection system comprised of a combination of reinforced concrete and steel sheet pile
walls. These structures would vary from one reach (a segment of shoreline) to another,
depending on the existing site characteristics, and would range in height from about four 
feet to about 14 feet above the existing or newly graded ground surface, given that the
elevation and slope of the ground varies for each reach.
Note: The public hearing on the draft EIR is closed. The public comment period for the draft
EIR ended on October 17, 2022. Public comment will be received when the item is called
during the hearing. However, comments submitted will not be included in the Final EIR.
