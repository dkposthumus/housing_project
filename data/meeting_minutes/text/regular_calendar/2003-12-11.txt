SPEAKER(S):
(-) Richard Shrieve - Discretionary Review Requestor

- He respects the right for the project sponsors to expand their homes.
- He respects the architect--the architect designed an addition to his house.
- He has two reasons to the Discretionary Review:  1) he would like the Commission and staff to bear in mind the cumulative impacts on mid-block open space of other additions that could occur if this one does.  There are at least three more families that are likely to expand if this one does; 2) It is important to voice the issues of the people who are most impacted, The Louie's and the Wongs.  Both of these parties are here to voice their opinion.
(-) James Louie
- The 927 Lake Street owner should get together with the rest of the neighbors to have more discussions and reach a mutually acceptable conclusion.
(-) Jean Ng
- The proposed construction will limit her air circulation.

- She requested that the Commission direct the project sponsor to reach an agreement with all the neighbors.

- She is here to reinforce the opinion of the Discretionary Review requestors and the supporters of the DR.

- She displayed a map of the open space currently on the properties of the block.
(+) Rob Mackethan - Project Sponsor
- He and his wife purchased their home about 10 years ago.  They now have three children and have actually "outgrown" their home.  That is the reason for the expansion.
- Most of the neighbors have already made large additions to their homes.
- He feels that their addition is not out of character.
- He does not want to cause problems with the neighbors.
- He has had various conversations with his neighbors and because of these discussions his project has been scaled down.
(+) Dan Phipps - Project Architect
- He displayed images of the architectural aspects of the project.

RESIDENTIAL DEMOLITION POLICY- A proposal to modify and refine interim criteria to implement a Temporary Residential Demolition Policy requiring mandatory Discretionary Review of all dwelling unit demolitions not requiring Conditional Use authorization, with certain exceptions; to adopt a specific Soundness Determination process; and to adopt criteria for conformity with applicable General Plan policies and objectives; and a recommendation to apply this policy for an approximate six-month period, after which a long-term policy would be presented for consideration and adoption by the Commission.
Preliminary recommendation: Adopt the Temporary Residential Demolition Policy.
NOTE: On November 6, 2003, following public testimony, the Commission kept the Public Hearing open and continued this item to December 11, 2003.
SPEAKER(S):
William Abend - AIA
- The only one issue that he has is that there has been three different policies for demolitions.
- Something should be done so that the project applicant should not have to pay in order to have things revised.
- He is available for questions.
Jeremy Paul
- It has been a long process to develop a policy on this issue.
- The Board of Appeals is going to be looking for more than numerical criteria.  They are going to be looking at the opinions from the Commission about the project that is being demolished.
- It is important for people to understand what is in front of them and this criteria will help a lot.
- People should be proactive in managing their decisions about what to do with the housing stock.  This is something that should be included in the policy.
- There has to be subjective criteria as well.
Pat Buscovich
- This process needs to be thorough and this document is very thorough.
- There should be some additional check list information that needs to be incorporated:  the assessor's files; the three R reports from the Building Department; all permit histories; all the records from planning including whether the building is AS, and if it is AS, all the records, etc.
- The Planning Commission should understand that the Building Department is loath to tear a building down unless it is an eminent life-safety hazard.
- There are a large class of fire-damaged buildings that need to be torn down.
Hiroshi Fukuda - Richmond Community Association
- This hearing is being held during the holidays and that is why there are not that many people here.
- Any changes in the policy should be provided in a hand out so that the public knows what the changes are.
- The policy does not address the real issue of demolition.
Sue Hestor
- This policy should be adopted and moved along.
- There are lots of demolitions before the Commission and there are a lot of units that are being lost because of these demolitions.
- There is nothing objectionable in what staff is doing.
- It is very weary on people who are trying to stay on top of the documents.
- She would like [the policy] to have added a more thorough analysis of historical research.
ACTION: Approved as Corrected and Amended:
1. On Page 2 of the case report, under SCOPE OF THE POLICY, delete the wordEXACTLYin the description of projects to be exempted from the mandatory DR policy. They are: structures determined to be public hazards or structures damaged beyond feasible repair by fire, earthquake, or other act of God to be demolished and replaced exactly in kind, and recommended for demolition by the Director of the Department of Building Inspection..
2. Please note that Recommendation #2, page 3, regarding fee recovery has been revised to reflect hourly rates provided by Administration staff to reflect current costs to the Department. Note that the proposal allows 20 hours of staff time, including the initial filing fee, to be allocated to a project, without further notification of the applicant, for a total allowed billable cost of $1823.40.
3. In Recommendation #8, page 5, add "Contraction Cost Estimators" to the list of professionals allowed to author soundness reports. Also change the last sentence to read ". If the Commission rejects a Soundness Report, the Commission may require that any subsequent report for the project submitted to the Department be prepared by a new author meeting the requirements described above, not the original author."
4. Alter Recommendation #13, at the top of page 7, to read  " ... submit aCOMPLETEDsupplemental information formPROVIDED(RATHER THAN prepared) by the Department .."
5. Change  Recommendation #16 to read  "After an existing building is demolished, the replacement structure is built on what is briefly an infill lot. The Commission shall assess underlying zoning, neighborhood character, and surrounding unit density to encourage appropriate in-fill housing on sites in established neighborhoods, and to promote the construction of well-designed housing that preserves or enhances existing neighborhood character in conformity with the General Plan and the Residential Design Guidelines, where applicable. Therefore, the Discretionary Review of projects subject to this policy shall be advertised and noticed to include the permit application for the replacement structure, for the purpose of evaluating compliance of the project with Criteria 14 through 16. "
6. On Exhibit 2, the proposed Demolition Application Form. delete the word "exactly" in the description of buildings replaced in kind following a disaster. Also, please change the word "units" in Criterion 9 , to read, How many bedrooms are subject to rent control?" On page two of the form, the next to last paragraph needs to be revised to reflect the current hourly costs  and staff hours for fee recovery, as described earlier.
7. On Exhibit 3, the Criteria Checklist, on Item 1, the last sentence of the first paragraph should read: If so, a hearing is not required , then add the words UNDER THIS POLICY.
8. Split criterion 16 into a & b, to read, does the project increase the number of housing units?, and Does the project increase the number of bedrooms on site?
AYES: Antonini, Bradford Bell, Boyd, Feldstein, Hughes, S. Lee
