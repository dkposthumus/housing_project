375 FREMONT STREET- Public Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Report -Assessor's Block 3747, Lot 6 - The proposed project is a residential development of approximately 378,720 gross square feet consisting of 250 dwelling units and about 250 underground parking spaces.  The project site is located about mid-block on the eastern side of Fremont Street in the block bounded by Folsom, Fremont, Harrison and Beale Streets. The 18,906-square-foot site (approximately 0.43 acres) currently contains a two-story, approximately 46,500-square-foot office building, the Hjul Building, which was constructed in 1929 as an industrial building and subsequently converted to office use.  The existing building is listed in four local surveys of historic resources.  The office building would be demolished, and the site would be excavated for a five-level below-grade parking garage and a 300-foot-high, 33-story residential tower.  Vehicular access and two loading docks would be on Fremont Street.  The site is within the existing Rincon Hill Special Use District/ Residential Sub-District and the proposed Rincon Hill Mixed Use District.  The site is in the RC-4 (Residential/Commercial High-Density) Zoning District, the 250-R Height and Bulk District, and the proposed 350-R District.
Preliminary Recommendation:  No action required.
Note:  Written comments will be received at the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m. onJanuary 6, 2005. January 11, 2005.
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Theodore Brown - Attorney
- In April of 2002, an environmental document was filed.  He was told that the process would take about 12 months.  They are now in the 33rd month.  It has been 33 months and $12,000 a page for the report.
- There have been three different staff members that have reviewed this EIR.
- There were 8 traffic studies done for this site.  The EIR took so long that the Planning Department started a new traffic model and everything had to be changed to be project specific.
- Two totally complete wind studies had to be done.
- The building initially was not listed as a historic resource but the process has lasted so long that the building has become historical.
- This is a supper complete and detailed document that he had not seen before.
- He would like to have a timely hearing before the third year is up.
(+) Lou Blazej
- He is representing the Archdiocese of San Francisco.
- This is a very detailed document and he would like the same for the project the Archdiocese has.
- This project has taken too long to process.
- This project and the one for the archdiocese should have been heard together.
- He recommends that a Negative Declaration should be done.
(+) Steve Wilson - Council for the Archdiocese of San Francisco
- It is important to meet the housing needs.
- There are timing concerns here.
- The Commission should instruct staff to move this project along expeditiously.
- There is no cumulative environmental impact.  This is key to whatever comes next.
- There are a few exceptions: 1) there is an inconsistency in the project height and unit size; 2) the impact of population increase is not taken into account so that there is no guesswork.  This is the same story with the wind study; 3) Two projects should have a normal separation as mentioned in the hearing of November 29, 2004.
(+) Reed Diment - Rincon Hill Neighborhood Association
- The EIR is inadequate because it fails to thoroughly reflect the impact that this project would have on the Rincon Hill area.
- It does not portray the cumulative affect that approval of this project along with the other pipeline projects would have on the area.
- There will be no area left for the Commission to plan when the EIR for Rincon Hill comes before the Commission.
- The present project is inconsistent with the restrictions on the site.
- If the accepted changes for these requirements are approved, the opportunity will be lost that the staff undertook to create a diverse and family oriented community.
- It is not good to just look at individual projects.
(+) Azalia Merrell - Carpenter's Union
- She is speaking on housing and employment.
- Projects like this puts many people to work.
- This project will provide work force housing.
- There is no housing shortage, there is an affordable housing shortage.
(+) Jim Salinas, Sr. - Carpenter's Union
- He is always surprised that there is a deficit of housing.
- There are a number of benefits if the Commission approves this and moves it along.
(+) Andrew McCarthy
- This is an adequate EIR.
- This building has been reviewed on several separate occasions by several entities.
- On each review, the building was not determined to be a historical building.
- Staff now contends that the building is a building of significance.
- The Commission should reject the contention of significance.
ACTION: Hearing Held.  Public Comment is Closed.  No Action Required by the Commission.

SAN FRANCISCO BICYCLE PLAN-  Resolution of Intent to Initiate Amendments to the General Plannecessary to incorporate the Bicycle Plan in whole by reference into the General Plan and amend sections of the General Plan that are relevant to bicycling, including the Transportation Element and Downtown Area Plan, according to the goals of the Bicycle Plan.  The San Francisco Bicycle Plan is the result of a two-year collaborative planning process involving the Department of Parking and Traffic, the San Francisco County Transportation Authority, the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition and many other agencies and organizations.
Preliminary Recommendation: Adopt a Resolution of Intent to Initiate Amendments to the General Plan.
SPEAKER(S):
(+/-) Winchell Hayward
- He only opposes a few items of this proposal.
- He would be surprised if the suggestion that bicyclists and pedestrians should have access on bridges, highways and freeways would be implemented because of financial considerations.
- Adding bicycle lanes on trails that pedestrians use would be quite dangerous because many trains are single track and only intended for pedestrians.
ACTION: Approved
