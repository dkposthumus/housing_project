SENATE BILL 330: HOUSING CRISIS ACT OF 2019 – Informational Presentation – Bill 
establishing a statewide housing emergency until 2025, during which time certain 
localities would be prohibited from reducing zoned capacity for housing, reducing housing 
density below what is permitted under existing zoning and the General Plan for proposed 
projects, or imposing certain new parking and design standards. In these jurisdictions, the 
demolition of existing affordable housing would be prohibited unless certain conditions 
are met.  In all localities, the bill would generally limit the number of public hearings for 
code-complying housing projects, expedite some review timeframes, guarantee the 
zoning regulations in place at the time of a first application for up to three years, and allow 
for localities to delay enforcement of certain building code violations for “occupied 
substandard buildings” at the request of the property owner.

Sacramento, CA 95814 
 
SUBJECT: SB 330 – Vote “NO” 
 
Dear Chair Aguiar-Curry and Members of the Assembly Committee on 
Local Government: 
Please vote “NO” on SB 330. 
 
Local government and neighborhood control are vital to socially, 
ethnically, economically diverse nature of all towns and cities. 
 
This bill hands over decisions to the state which makes every city a cookie-
cutter homogenous uber-densified living compound with no regard to 
topography, natural resources, nor various infrastructure readiness as well 
as other matters too diverse and numerous to put in this letter. 
 
Building housing to create inequitable distribution and impacts is not 
objective. It might be a form of red-lining economically, socially, etc. 
 
Vote “NO” to nix SB 330 now.
