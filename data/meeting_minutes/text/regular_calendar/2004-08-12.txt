(Continued from Regular Meeting of July 22, 2004)
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Donna Hitchens - Discretionary Review Requestor
- She has lived here for 25 years.  The primary light and air is on the side that faces the project and it will be blocked.
- This is really an issue of the light and air available to their home.
- She realizes that the project sponsor has the right to renovate and make a profit.
- They set up a meeting with the project sponsor after the last continuance.  They made an offer and have not received a counter offer from them.
(-) Bob Baum - Project Architect
- The developer does not comply with Prop M or the Residential Design Guidelines.
- There is more than one neighbor who opposes the project.
- He displayed diagrams of the project showing that the proposed project is not comparable in height and bulk.
- They have prepared a model which displays a project that is in compliance with the Residential Design Guidelines and consists of good neighbor policies.
(-) Mark Madsen
- He lives on 30thStreet.
- He has a business at home and relies on the light coming into his work area.
- He does not oppose to the remodel but he does oppose the size and bulk of it.
- The developers will not be their neighbors since they will just remodel and leave.  The neighbors have a long time interest in the area.
(-) JoAnne Madsen
- They have made improvement to their home keeping within the neighbors wishes.
- They enjoy natural light in four bedrooms.  This light really opens up the house and makes it look larger and warmer.
- Their picturesque windows will look into a wall.
- They will loose much of the charm and appeal of their home.
- Her garden has been a tenure project for many years.
- The project sponsor has continued with their project with disregard to the issues exposed by the neighbors.
- Please preserve the neighborhood and her garden by not approving this proposal.
(-) Claire Piltcher
- She funded Friends of Noe Valley about 30 years ago.
- She has worked closely with [many] developers and she has concerns.  The revised Residential Design Guidelines are not being met (and knows the older version by heart).
- This is clearly a demolition and it is happening all over the city.
- If there isn't some relief given to these neighbors, they will have to appeal the decision.
- The DR requestors have not been given the opportunity for a light well or a set back.
(-) Darlene Crisp
- She has lived in the neighborhood for many years.
- This project conflicts with the City's Master Plan.
- This massive construction will increase the rental rate and selling price for properties.
- The size of the building is completely out of scale with the neighborhood.
- The massive expansion in the rear yard will block sunlight to the neighbors.
- If one lived next door to this project, one would not like to have their lifestyle affected.
(-) Jace Levinson
- The impact will be detrimental.
- This proposal is just too huge and it will impact the adjacent building.
- While the Planning Code allows the size of this project, it is not required.
(-) Tom Mogensen - Upper Noe Neighbors
- They support the Discretionary Review because the project does not respect the character of the neighborhood.
- It seems that the matter here is not having bedrooms but how big these bedrooms should be.
- He suggests that the Commission take Discretionary Review.
(+) John Sanger - Representing the Project Sponsor
- Often when there is a renovation, it will impact the adjacent neighbors in some way.
- The project will extend 13 feet in the rear and will be set back.
- A neighbor did a similar project in 2002 and it did not include a setback.
- The Residential Design Guidelines allows what is being proposed.
- The project will not have an intrusion in the mid block open space.
(+) James Aaron - Project Architect
- The intent of the project was to not impact the neighbors.
- He has not had an opportunity to view the model that was presented by the Discretionary Review requestor's representative so he has not been able to verify the scale.
- The project has a very convectional design.
(+) Joe O'Donaghue
- Staff approved this project not because of developer power.
- His house is right next to a very blank wall.  We live in a city so it is hard to avoid these types of situations.
- If this situation was really about light and air, the way the project is being designed, this has no impact at all.
- Many of the neighbors in Noe Valley are not here and they are not here for a reason.

- There is a housing crisis and this project will increase housing.
- He strongly recommends that the Commission approve this project.
(+) Jim Keith - Residential Builders Association
- If the DR requestor's logic prevails, they would not be able to live in the house that they live in.
- The idea that the Project Sponsor's project impacts light and air is not adequate.
- Many people support this project and he hopes that the Commission will support it as well.
(+) Joe Cassidy
- He has been building in Noe Valley for many years.
- There is always a fight.
- He knows the Project Sponsor and knows that they are building a great project.
(+) Grace Shanahan
- The McGees are long time builders in the Noe Valley area and they are very respectful of what they build.
- She encourages the Commission to support the project.
(+) Dave O'Keiff
- He has built small projects in the area.
- It seems that when someone remodels or builds a larger home it automatically becomes a monster home.
- Many neighbors are more than happy with this project because it will increase their property value.
- He hopes that this is not just a view issue.
(+) Reed Caroll
- The project is comparable to other projects.
- The project is consistent with adjacent properties.
- This project should be applauded and supported instead of being rejected.
(+) Sean Keigran
- This project is one aspect of an overall housing crisis.
- Communities should accept all types of houses.

(Continued from Regular Meeting of June 17, 2004)
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Steve Williams - Representing Discretionary Review Requestor
- He agrees with the determination by staff.
- For six years, staff has been telling the developer to remove the 4thfloor and match the light-wells, yet the developer has not agreed to it.
- This developer has caused the department to spend a lot of money.
- This project even got to the point of being cancelled.
- He would actually want to have the project cancelled in order to stop serial applications.
(-) Jack Norton - Discretionary Review Requestor
- He was born and raised in the neighborhood and his mother (91 years old) lives across the street.
- The proposed project does not meet the Residential Design Guidelines.
- According to the Architectural Heritage Foundation, his house was the first to be built on that block.
- The proposed project would be the largest on the block.  It is too large and will overwhelm and denigrate their home.
- All buildings surrounding the project are only two stories.
- There are various neighborhood organizations who do not support the project.
(-) Loren Lopin
- He lives in the neighborhood.
- Six planners have recommended to revise the project and eliminate the fourth floor and provide good neighbor gestures.
- He asked the members of the audience who oppose this project to stand up (about 20 people stood up).
(-) Dennis Estrada
- He has lived in the Richmond District for 35 years.
- He is representing the 21stAvenue Coalition and they agree to the recommendations provided by staff.
(-) Julian Hultgren
- He lives on 21stAvenue and is against this project.
- He believes that eliminating the 4thfloor would be much more in keeping with the neighborhood.
- There is an apartment building on the block and it is only three stories.
- Limiting the project to three stories would make it more compatible with the neighborhood.
(-) Marjorie Norton
- She is 91 years old.  She has lived across the street from the proposed house since 1912.
- She opposes the four story building because it is big and out of character with the neighborhood.
- She urges the Commission to limit the project to three stories.
(-) Edwina Cherrington
- She has lived across the street from the proposed project since the 1960s.
- The subject project is an exact replica of her home.
- The four story modern building is too large.
- It is another "Richmond Special"
- She asks the "professional" developer to limit the project to three stories and retain the façade.
(-) Hiroshi Fukuda - Richmond Community Association
- He feels that "alterations" are sometimes deceptive.  This has major alterations.
- Families are leaving San Francisco because there are not enough single-family homes.
- Thousands of homes have been taken off the market.
- Recent studies have indicated that San Francisco is behind in providing housing.
- This project is not going to help people who need moderate housing.
(+) Jerod Eigerman - Reuben and Junius
- The project sponsor is not a professional developer.
- The project is code compliant.
- He has no knowledge of any agreement with Jake McGoldrick.
- Discretionary Review is for extraordinary circumstances.  Good neighbor gestures have been made in this case.
- What they are asking for is not outlandish.
- There is nothing in the guidelines that states that if there is one building on one side you cannot build higher.
- There is no peculiar hardship because they are on the south side.
(+) Reza Khoshnevisan - Project Architect
- Regarding the demolition, if a floor were to be added, the entire foundation would have to be replaced.
- There is no way that the fourth floor would be visible.
- He is available if the Commission has any questions.
ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and approve the project with the following conditions:  The modifications included:
· Eliminate the fourth floor;
· Continue the side setback at the rear of the southern side down to the roof of the ground level to match the existing setback and allow for light and air to the DR Requestor's window;
· Provide an interior connection between the "Common Room" on the first floor (garage level) and the second floor; and
· Require an NSR be recorded to restrict the "Common Room" on the first floor from becoming an illegal unit.
