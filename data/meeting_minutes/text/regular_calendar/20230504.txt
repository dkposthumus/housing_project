2861-2899 SAN BRUNO AVENUE (AKA 90-98 WOOLSEY STREET) – east side between 
Woolsey and Wayland Streets; Lots 037 and 022 in Assessor’s Block 5457 (District 9) – 
Request for Conditional Use Authorization under Planning Code Sections 303 and 317 to 
address multiple Notices of Violation from the Planning Department and Department of 
Building Inspection by removing 20 dwelling units constructed without the benefit of a 
permit within five contiguous buildings on Lot 37 that are currently authorized for ground 
floor retail sales and service uses, second floor non-retail professional service uses, and a 
total of 10 dwelling units on the third and fourth floors (five flats per floor, across five 
buildings). The proposal also seeks to legalize the exceedance of construction and the de 
facto demolition and modification of original approval to allow 2nd floor non-retail 
professional services and two residential flats on the third and fourth floors of the building 
at 2861 San Bruno Avenue (Lot 22). This building was originally approved as ground floor 
commercial, and two residential townhouse units at the second, third and fourth floors. 
The proposal will restore the buildings to their original approved features, including 
various façade modifications. As proposed, the Project (inclusive of Lots 037 and 022) 
would result in 12 dwelling units within six contiguous, four-story buildings. The Project 
also includes twelve off-street accessory parking spaces, 12 Class 1, and three Class 2 
bicycle parking spaces. Lastly, the Project also seeks to modify the method of inclusionary 
housing compliance, as described in Condition of Approval No. 10-15 from Motion No. 
18782, changing from providing one on-site affordable housing unit to payment of the in-
lieu fee. The Planning Department found that the project is exempt from the California 
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The Commission’s action constitutes the Approval 
Action for the project for the purposes of CEQA, pursuant to San Francisco Administrative 
Code section 31.04 (h). 
Preliminary Recommendation: Approve with Conditions

- Jerry Dratler – Tenant relocation, rent controlled units
- Georgia Schuttish – On January 17, 2013 the original architects said that 
2nd floor would not become housing due to fact that it could not meet
Code for egress, square footage constraints could not allow adding a
second stairway. Public concerned about housing on 2nd floor at hearing.
Commission discussed possibility/problems of housing on this floor. Sent 
an email to the Commission on April 20, 2023. 2861-2865 San Bruno
Avenue portion of project should have received greater scrutiny when
approved as Alteration in 2014. This was after the use and abuse of the
Demo Calcs at Crown Terrace which fell down the hill in 2013 after also
being approved as an Alteration in 2012. Demo Calcs should have been
adjusted sometime between 2009 and 2012-2014. It is appropriate to ask:
Why did the owners think they could get away with this illegal project
which is located in proposed Priority Equity Geographies SUD?
