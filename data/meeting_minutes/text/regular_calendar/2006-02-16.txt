SPEAKERS:Marilyn Amini- In a January 31st. communication by the Department, the statement is made that the Department initiated a new Better Neighborhoods plan along Geary Street.- Initiation of a new planning area requires Commission action.- I have some material that was taken out of the Better Neighborhood file and it's authored by David Alumbaugh, and it's actually pertaining to the Geary Corridor and talks about initiation and the fact that there has to be Planning Department initiation hearings.- To my knowledge, there has been no Commission initiation hearing where public can comment on it.- If you take action on the budget today, will your action on the budget automatically and/or by default be action to endorse the Geary Better Neighborhoods without the Brown Act required public comment, adequate notice, et cetera?- How can the department initiate without Commission initiation hearings and without the public comment?ACTION:  ApprovedAYES:  S.

WILSON: (415) 558-6163)2600 CHESTNUT STREET - northwest corner of Chestnut Street and Richardson Avenue; Lot 005A in Assessor's Block 0932 - Request for Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application No. 2004.10.26.7675, proposing to build a three-story horizontal addition to the east of the three-story single-family house, and a two-story addition over the existing one-story garage, in an RH-1 (Residential, House, One-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project as revised.(Continued from Regular Meeting of January 12, 2005)
SPEAKERS:Richard Wall, Discretionary Review Requestor- My wife and I live at 2660 Chestnut Street and have lived there for some 37 years.- The plans as submitted refer to the fact that there would be an existing two-unit building.- Now, on the lot, which is larger than normal, it was created when the freeway was established for the Golden Gate Bridge.  A portion of an adjoining lot was cut off and added to this lot.- When the applicants purchased the property some time in the early 1980's, several years later, they put an existing garage on the open space on the corner.  There was no opposition to this by the neighbors.- The problem that the neighbors first had with this was some time later when it was told it was going to be used for something other than residential purposes.- The applicant operated his business, a plumbing business, out of the garage.  Chestnut Street is an RH-1 Residential Area.- The proposed coverage of this RH-1 lot is excessive.- The applicants are taking a four-bedroom, three bath house, which is in excess of 3,500 square feet, and propose to add to it so that there will be seven bedrooms, six and a half baths, and four other rooms that have been identified recently as a family room, a study, a sun room, and an exercise room.- As part of the information I received, the applicants have stated that the property has not been rented.- This is inaccurate.- The building was rented to a number of unrelated individuals.  They were young and gave a lot parties that went on into the late hours.  When neighbors complained, the applicant's response was 'it's not our problem.'- I'd like to quickly tell you that this building as you see it today is an eyesore.- It has not been maintained for the past several years.- It's been vacant.Jean Caramatti- A large concern I have is that none us ever received any notification of this project.  I've been told by your project manager that notification did go out. While we all agree that at times there are problems with mail delivery, absolutely none of us received any information about this.- If residents of this city can't rely on the process that is going to keep us informed about what is happening in our neighborhoods and how it will impact our own property values and our quality of life, then we don't have much of a process going on in this city and it needs to be evaluated.- It was posted on the building so it assumes that all of us would have to be walking every square inch of our neighborhood looking at buildings, looking at sign posts to make sure nothing is going on that might impact us.- That is not acceptable.- I hope you will correct this and look into this.- And under the circumstances, grant us discretionary review because we have had no time to do anything.Jean Hayes- I have been a resident at 2646 Chestnut Street for 36 years and I have enjoyed living there.- I would like to continue to enjoy living there.- I object to what is planned at the corner of our street.Deborah Goodman- We live at 2670 Chestnut Street- We've only been there for one year so I can only rely on information that our neighbors give us about what has transpired at 2600 Chestnut Street over the last 40 years.- However, I can tell you after reading the information that was given in copy to me by Mr. Wall, because I didn't receive any information either, that the information about renters as stated is false.- Even since the time I've been there, which has been a year, there have been renters in the building.- I haven't monitored the building, but I was just reading this and I know that statement is false.- So when I look at the plans and see a four-bedroom building being transformed into a seven-bedroom building with exercise rooms and sun rooms and things, I also question the transparency of what is really going on here with these plans and what will ultimately happen in the future.Denise Wall- I've been a little bit more than annoyed at some of the rumors that are going around the neighborhood.- Mrs. Lee is going around and petitioning all the neighbors to sign in their favor.- My neighbor who lives directly behind me where the Lees used to live said she [the applicant] is only doing a new kitchen.- Somebody else said she's just adding on a room.- I don't know how many people signed the petition, but I do want you to know that they weren't told the truth.- I'm opposed to the project.Patricia Vaughey, Cow Hollow Neighbors and Merchants- I've been watching this case because there are other buildings in the neighborhood that we have had problems with that these people own.- My suggestion is to put some special restrictions on this case because they simply have not been good neighbors in several sections of the area.- In a previous case, they said that they were going to build a garage for residential use and ended up being a plumbing [shop] in both buildings.- They were told to revise their plans and they said they were not going to change anything.- I'm concerned.- Require the Notice of Special Restrictions to keep it RH-1, not RH-3; to make sure the plumbing pipes are removed from the kitchen that is proposed to be torn out; and require that they paint [a problem we have had with them in the past] and maintain the property.- If they don't do these things, the neighbors would have the right to bring this back to the Planning Commission.Mrs. Lee, Project Sponsor- My husband and I would like to ask for your approval of our plans to remodel our home at 2600 Chestnut Street.- We have lived in the Marina District for over 40 years, right around the corner from this property at 3130 Lyon Street.- We understand that Mr. Wall means no ill to us or our family.- He said his complaint is not personal- However, our plans and intent for this property are personal.- My son is newly married and he plans to start a family at this home.- We are a close family but we both want to have our privacy.- Our only purpose is to see our son raise his family in the neighborhood he grew up in.Morgan Lee, Jr.- I grew up in the Marina District.- I was recently married and my wife Katherine and I would like to start a family soon.- Being of Chinese descent, we would like our parents to help raise our children.- Extended family support is important in our culture.- The remodeling with the proposed improvements will give my family and me the opportunity to live together under the same roof with my parents and have enough space.- The additional space will be a central necessity once we begin to expand our family with another generation of San Franciscans.Jenny Lu- I'm a friend of the family.- I'm in favor of the project.- [Presented to the Commission letters from all the key corners and those having direct views of the subject site in support of the project.  She also presented a petition signed by supporters.]Architect for the project- Unfortunately the original architect passed away and I can't answer to the original plan.- At one point plans did show two kitchens.- That might be causing the confusion as to why it was thought it would be two units.- My client is willing to sign whatever to assure that there will always be one unit.

SPEAKERS:Representing Project Sponsor- The top of the hillside is zoned RM-1 so you can have large buildings at the tip.- This building was empty when bought by Spring and Yuen.- The former occupant had lived there for 43 years.  When she died her heirs did not want to live in the facility.- The tenants who had lived there before moved our beforehand.- There was no dialogue or request for any kind of relocation.- This is clearly a multi-family neighborhood.- In regard to parking, the proposed project is building one-to-one parking and the cul-de-sac allows 90 degree parking.  It gets twice as many parking spaces than most neighborhoods.- We are demolishing this current garage.- When we are done the curb cut will be reduced to 10 feet and the garage entry will be reduced to nine feet, which creates another parking space.- Yuen and Spring have really made an effort to reach all the neighbors because they live there now with their infant daughter.- They will live there after the construction.- This is really a family housing.- The four two-bedroom units are 1300 square feet and the two, three or four bedroom units (depending on what the occupant wants to have) will either be three bedrooms and a family room or four bedrooms with no family room.- We have agreed to do construction from 8 to 5, five days a week.- 25 neighbors signed a petition indicating they had no objection to the project.  Those are all people in the cul-de-sac abutting the project.  We also have four other letters directly supporting the project.- The neighbor immediately to the west had concerns about her light well.- Because the program would not permit a matching light well, we agreed to put lot line windows so she wouldn't be looking at a blank wall and we agreed to put three new skylights in her house, which would give her far more light into the kitchen, the bathroom, and the utility room that would be off the skylight.- I'm not worried about the quality of construction. Yuen does great work.- This is where they're going to live.Robert Levenson-  The building will increase the density of what is there already, in one of the most dense areas of Noe Valley.- The proposed structure will have a significant negative impact on quality of life, public safety and access in neighborhood.- The height of the building at four stories above the garage level exceeds every other building on the street.- Although I have great respect for the desire of this group to be good neighbors, and I think they have been and they will be, I do think that there is a great deal of difference between the two-story, two-family unit that exists now and four-story, six-family units proposed.- I would ask the Planning Commission to consider whether something in between really makes a little bit more sense given the character of the neighborhood.David Parkinson- I live at 4130 Cesar Chavez, which is the apartment building directly across the Street.- My window looks directly across at Ewen's building.- I did not receive any notice of this project at all.- I did not receive any invitation to look at the plans from Ewen.- The scope is a little bit large.- There is no historic value to this building.- Maybe four units would be a good compromise.- I realize that there is one parking spot allowed per unit.- And I realize it is the latest thing to try to get people out of their cars and use public transportation.- But people don't do it.  Especially not in Noe Valley.- People park on the street.- I just have these concerns.Mark Thomas, Project Architect- To the best of my knowledge, Ewen and Spring did substantial neighborhood outreach.- I attended four neighborhood meetings with Ewen and Spring.- They obtained approximately 26 signatures and various letters of support.- I think the neighborhood was well informed of the project.- The building was delivered to Ewen and Spring vacant.- We met with Department staff and reviewed our idea of putting a six-unit building rather than a seven or eight-unit building in this RM-1 neighborhood.- Usually at the top of a hill the density is a little greater and the buildings are a little taller.- As the buildings come down the hillside they get a little bit smaller and more refined in scale.- In terms of its size, I think Ewen and Spring have been reasonable in following the Residential Design Guidelines.- The building steps back from the front street elevation twice on the third and fourth levels; in the back once at the fourth level; and along the easterly side at the second, third and fourth levels.- We tried really hard to minimize the impact of the proposed building on the street by keeping the front faÃ§ade generally the same as the existing building's faÃ§ade.  And I think we've managed to do that.- But at the same time we've provided Ewen and Spring with a family house and fulfill the directives and goals of the General Plan.- In terms of greenery and cars being parked in Noe Valley - there is 90 degree parking on this street, which means that this street has double the street parking available to the residents.- We will provide one-to-one parking and we will also be providing a small garden space out front in the form of a couple of planters to help soften the pedestrian way and emphasize the importance of the pedestrian entrance and minimize the vehicular entrance.Ewen Utting, Project Sponsor- When we first moved into the property, we notified the neighbors of our intention to modify and do some work.- That was the 311 notice that went out.- I then hit the street and got to know my neighbors by informing them of our proposed project.- I have a pretty good relationship with most of the neighbors.- We received a very positive feedback from a majority of the neighbors.- We would love to take one the top units to accommodate our family plans, and live in the building with other families, true San Francisco style, the American dream with kids playing in the backyard and all.- It's a cul-de-sac street.  Perfect for kids.  Very little through traffic.- We've had meetings with both our neighbors and I've tried to address many if not all of their concerns.- I'm the contractor.- I think it's a great project.Spring Utting - co-project sponsor- I just want to share with you.  We love Noe Valley.  We've lived in the area for about eight years now and looking for a place where we can raise our family.- We think this will be a great place to share with other families in the backyard.Luke Gilligan- I would like to support the project.- I think it's a very nice project.  It would be affordable housing for young couples buying into that neighborhood.- The parks are there.  The schools are there.- It would also benefit the city.- All the young families with kids are moving away from the city.- Something like this would be a great opportunity to get young families back into the community.- I would like to support the project.Lisa Bruckner- I have met with Ewen and Spring.- I've also reviewed the plans.- I support the project and I certainly hope the Board will support it.- I live in a three-story building on the same block and I'm quite glad to have them as neighbors.Peter Brannigan- I think this is a very appropriate site for a building of this height and density because of all the larger buildings around.- I encourage you to support this project.
Jeffrey Heuer- I live just below the project site at 1409 Noe Street.- I can see the building and the project site from my front door.- I think it is a great use of the space.- I think it is a good project for the neighborhood and it is in the right spot.- I encourage the Board to think the same way and approve the project.Beverly Freyberg- I'm a neighbor to the west of Cesar Chavez.- I received notification of this project in the mail.- I looked it over and I like the building.  It's a nice looking building.- I think this building will enhance the neighborhood and I would suggest that you approve the project.

SPEAKERS:Joe Glenn, Discretionary Review Requestor- I live at 756 Fifth Avenue.- We are not opposed to the demolition of this building.- But we do have concerns about the design and the size of the structure.- This will be on the corner lot and have a greater negative impact on the individual character of the neighborhood.- The proposed structure is lacking in architectural detail or distinction seems to have been designed to minimize costs and maximize profit.- The building occupies a maximum allowable envelope in conflict with the city's own Urban Design Guidelines.- We strongly suggest the new building should blend with the surroundings rather than overwhelm them- Furthermore, the architectural details do not adhere to the residential guidelines set forth by the San Francisco Planning Department.- The appearance of the building would be detrimental to the character of the neighborhood.- It will increase the current difficulties of parking.Karen Gorin- In the packet we gave you there are signatures from 16 property owners and 23 individuals.- They are concerned about the design of the project.- We are asking that the Project Sponsor re-look at the design of the building and look at something that is not visually disruptive to what is already there.- We're asking that you guys re-look at the design and not approve it as planned.- We are also concerned about the floor plan and the elevator to the penthouse.- We are concerned about the commercial zoning.Eva Young- I live on Fourth Avenue.- I would like to register concern about this project.- I see that it is quite a large area and it may have impacts in the neighborhood.- I didn't know about this project until two days ago.- I didn't really have a chance to study it thoroughly yet.Alice Yavorsky- Concerned about the elevator that goes up to the penthouse.  In a four-story building that is largely 75% residential, there are no existing elevators.Janet Underwood- Concerned about the traffic impact in the neighborhood.Roberta Wallace, Architect for the project- We did do some due diligence.- We just had a neighborhood meeting.

14. 2004.0160U                    (J. RUBIN: (415) 558-6310, J. JARAMILLO: (415) 575-6818)CONSIDERATION OF A RESOLUTION TO ADOPT INTERIM CONTROLS FOR AREAS OF THE EASTERN NEIGHBORHOODS AND CENTRAL WATERFRONT (PROPOSED FOR CONTINUANCE) - Public hearing on a resolution adopting interim zoning controls that would establish Mixed-Use Residential, Employment and Business Development, and Urban Mixed-Use areas for sections of the Mission (generally bounded by Guerrero, Division, Potrero, and Cesar Chavez Streets), Showplace Square/Potrero Hill (generally bounded by 7th, Bryant, Potrero and 26th Streets, and I-280), East SoMa (generally bounded by Mission, 7th, Harrison, 4th and Townsend Streets, and the Embarcadero), and the Central Waterfront (generally bounded by Mariposa Street, I-280, Islais Creek, and the Bay).  The Mixed-Use Residential area would support residential development; the Employment and Business Development area would support production, distribution and repair (PDR) activities, including digital-media; and the Urban Mixed-Use area would require limited amounts of PDR space associated with a wide array of other uses, including housing.  The proposed interim controls would also establish overlay areas including, but not limited to: 1) a Design and Showroom district intended to support those activities in the Showplace Square area and 2) an Arts and Technology district intended to encourage activities interrelated with the California College of Arts and nearby development in Mission Bay.  At this hearing, staff will make a presentation that covers the process for adopting interim controls and a summary of the controls themselves, and lead a discussion on the definition of PDR.  At subsequent hearings the following topics are proposed to be discussed:- District controls- Urban design, open space and other topics.Preliminary Recommendation: Hold hearings and continue adoption to a date certain.
SPEAKERS:Curtis Eisenberger- We oppose interim controls.- We think that the grandfathering timeline is kind of arbitrary.  But beyond that, we do not think that the details of these controls are workable.Mark Klaiman- I am concerned about the use of an all-inclusive PDR definition in this document.- PDR businesses are different than other properties that are simply not residential retail personal services and not institutional.- I agree we need flexibility, but we cannot predict the PDR uses in the future.- We also need to further address thee PDR's that decide to stay in the mixed-use neighborhoods.- We should not subject them to being classified as nonconforming uses.- They should be allowed to stay as conforming uses.- We should encourage density of residential units in the neighborhood.- We also need to address relocation assistance for those PDR's that are forced to leave any area that is changes because of these interim controls.Bob Legallet- I work with the Back Street Business Advisory Board- I worked extensively with the Planning Department and the development of these PDR definitions.- It is an example of my family's experience with conversion of industrial space.- I have 4,000 square feet of property that my grandfather developed.- We rent out to tenants who are the true PDR backbone of this city.- I'm here to defend their usefulness and productivity to the city as a whole.- I'm also here to encourage you to do the same in your consideration of the interim controls.- The Back Street Business Board, the District deemed the employment of business development district is intended to provide the most protection for PDR businesses.- Yet there are other business types allowed under the interim controls because economies will not compete or displace or preclude the traditional PDR users.- This is a dangerously broad definition of PDR to allow the biotech, digital media, and other high tech industries in PDR zones.- We recommend that PDR should be more explicitly defined, rather than defined simply by what it isn't since the Interim Controls are going to create true PDR protection.Sarah Schindler, Morrison and Forester representing Southern Hills Properties at Mission and Cesar Chavez- We are replacing a one-story use with 16 units of retail.- This is currently under environmental review but it will be coming before the commission during the interim period.- The current affordability requirement is only 12%.- But language in this draft says that new projects with ten or more units shall provide at least 20% of units with two or more bedrooms.- And that they are strongly encouraged to be affordable.- This recommendation is much higher and all of the affordable units would be the large two-bedroom units.- This design guideline is inconsistent with the commission's recommendation of last week that changes to housing requirements should be deferred until completion of the pending housing and feasibility nexus study.- This seems to be a way to sort of get around that recommendation.- Inclusionary housing requirements require analysis and that is what the study is doing.  It is questionable whether this is appropriately a design guideline.Barbara Florez- I am a member of the public that benefits from the PDR.- I have an arts studio down between third and fourth and Harrison.- This whole area is being revamped for affordable housing development.- It sounds fabulous and wonderful for the city, but we are here to let the commission know there is a whole group of us from the studio and that in all these projects that are happening all over town, there are some really fabulous things that are being obliterated.- Down in that area is an incredible art resource of San Francisco.- It's called space 743 - The Clay Studio.- 32 to 36 artists have studios there.- I want to make sure you look closely at all these projects.- When those developers tell you, and those lawyers and those huge publicity firms with boxes or paperwork that allow them to do what they do, that you look closely at those projects because there are people living down there who are doing wonderful things to support the City and all that is about to be lost.Ken Watson, Graphics Sportswear- 1240 Minnesota Street- Currently supporting 100 employees in San Francisco since 1979.- I applied for permits back in September 2004 and just curious what is going on and hoping we can stay with the mixed PDR residential.- It helps financially to keep my employees employed.- I'm curious to know where the commission stands as far as the grandfathering of projects like this.Alison Poole- We represent the exciting residential mixed-use project on Harrison between Third and Fourth Streets.- It features over 570 residential units including townhouses with two and three bedrooms and ground floor neighborhood serving retail uses.- It is one of the few remaining projects in Eastern SOMA available for high density mixed-use housing.- There should be exceptions to the Interim Controls for properties adjacent to freeway alleys and elimination of mandatory walkways to freeway alleys because they would not be used.Gregg Miller, Pillsbury Law Firm in San Francisco- We represent the concerned owners of several pieces of property in the Eastern neighborhoods.- On behalf of those owners, I ask that you eliminate the PDR replacement and mandatory PDR inclusion aspects of the controls because they are punitive and unnecessarily restrictive.- In all of these districts the controls require certain ratio of PDR space to be part of any new residential development.- With so little existing demand for such space, these PDR replacement requirements will be haunting development in these districts.Robert Herr, Pillsbury Law Firm in San Francisco- Why is it that U.M.U. is grandfathered for projects that were applied for before November 17, but not those other districts?- I want to say that I am not asking for a grandfather provision to be applied generally to those other districts.  We are asking for something much simpler.- We simply do not want projects for which applications are already on file to not be processed by the staff.- As to the point that interim controls are a way for the department to basically stop processing applications is precisely our primary concern.- Just because you have adopted interim controls doesn't mean that you will adopt permanent controls.- You have twice in the last five years imposed interim controls in portions of the Eastern neighborhoods and never adopted permanent controls.- So, you stop processing applications simply because the are inconsistent with interim controls even if there is no expectation and no requirement that this commission actually considers those and approve those projects during the period that the interim controls are in effect.- You are in effect declaring a moratorium on development in the area, which I think is a big mistake.- Our suggestion is that you give clear direction to staff to continue to process applications, not to bring them before you for approval, but just to process them even though they may be inconsistent with the interim controls.- On the alley issue that Ms. Poole mentioned - the requirements in the interim controls with respect to alleys are not guidelines, they are mandatory.- Unless you provide an exception for the three-way tunnel she was describing, this commission would have no flexibility.- You would have to impose the setbacks and other requirements of requests for alleys even though it makes utterly no sense.Theodore Brown, Theodore Brown Architects- I am here in support of the Gardens at Harrison project, which is a project we've been working on since August of '04.- We would like to keep that project moving ahead.Steven Gruel- I along with 'Robert McCarthy of McCarthy and Schwartz represent the Colier Company.- The Colier Company represents a building that is included in the interim controls - The McGuire Furniture Building, which is located at 1201 Bryant Street.- It has been there since 1927 and it is a furniture manufacturing company and has acted so for quite some period of time.- I'm here to oppose this particular site being included in the interim controls.- Asked the Commission to exclude 1201 Bryant Street because geographically by boundaries it is in the Western SOMA, not the Eastern neighborhoods.Elan Drucker, GCA Strategies representing McGuire Furniture Company- Our site happens to be surrounded by retail.- The City's largest retailer, COSTCO, is just across the street.- Down the block is OMID, a rug retailer and a showroom.- Kitty corner across the street is another antique retailer.- It is not just industrial PDR.- One thing we want to assure is that McGuire Center has no interest in moving.  It has no interest in discontinuing any of its furniture making activities.- We agree with staff in 2001 that the property belongs in Western SOMA.Fred Snyder- I want to speak on 550 Florida - an old subject that's come up a few times - the Mission Linen site.- This area is inter-mixed with housing and PDR uses on every block.- 550 Florida is a block that does not have housing, but it is surrounded completely by housing.- I would like to get the urban mixed-use [zoning].- Have a continuous zoning here for the whole area because ten years from now housing will fill even more on that block.Jim Allen- Mission Linen has told us in the last few weeks they are going to be leaving because they are paying more for water than they are for rent.- They have installed every water conservation and recycling equipment that they can and still their water costs are driving then out of San Francisco.- Two things are driving them out, water costs and the employment tax.- We believe that building is going to be vacant in the near future.- The way the map is currently drawn, that leaves us as a PDR or industrial use surrounded by urban mixed-use, which is probably going to become more and more housing.- We would like to be included in urban mixed-use because it makes the property much more feasible for compatible use in the neighborhood.Nina Saltman- I am little confused as to whether for or against the Interim Controls.- Basically we want the Planning Commission to look at the project, which is the Gardens at Harrison Street, and think about what is happening there.- I don't think we even remotely expect we can stop that project, but maybe as commissioners you can make sure that whatever projects do happen can take into consideration the fact that we are being displaced and that a really viable wonderful art space is being destroyed by this project.- Again, I'm not really sure if the interim controls would have a better affect on that or not.Kyle Prenhould- I also am an artist at Clay Studio/- I'm opposed to the interim controls as they stand now because I don't believe they go far enough in protecting PDR uses like ours in east SOMA, which is zoned for all mixed-use housing and has no protections for uses such as ours that I believe would be compatible with housing, which is the focus of that new zoning district.- I also don't think that the controls for inclusionary housing, low-income housing go far enough.- It's a shame that it seems as though the controls, which are set out to kind of provide some kind of stabilizing guideline to the area, aren't doing that for that particular use.- I would ask the commission to really consider that as they look at approving the interim controls if that is what they decide to do.Jane Martin- I'm here as an owner's representative for a company at 2360 Third Street- I don't think that this is the appropriate time during the planning process to implement interim controls.- The property that I'm here about today has been selected as a potential PDR continued use,- And that is not in conversation with the current owner.- It was through planning department staff walking the streets, as I understand it, walking the streets and identifying the buildings that looked like they might be appropriate for PDR use.- I'm saying that there are a number of properties that need to be looked at more closely in order to know that this is the right thing to do.Joyce Fujiwara- I'm here for the Clay Studio and feel that the loss of this organization is going to be a huge loss to the community.- I would just hope that you would take into consideration the arts that are moving out of the city.- Yu guys could consider affordable arts space to try to keep the artists in San Francisco.Paige Patterson- I'm also here to speak on behalf of the Clay Studio.- I take classes with some of the people who have spoken here.- I just want to state my support for the space.  It's a great community space.- In addition to the individual artists, there is a large community space for people like myself who choose to spend five to ten hours a week there.- They offer very affordable classes.- It's got great instruction.Dwight Dolliver- I have a few multi-use properties down and around 18th and Harrison Street.- There should be some of sort of consistent zoning in all this area.- There does not seem to be any kind of consistency in this.- The 5,000 square foot cap on space seems to be ridiculous when you talk about multi-media space.- People with film and video need space.- You have to have some sort of flexibility in this stuff.- A lot of us have a lot of money on the line - a whole life savings.- We literally subsidize our renters and what it costs to maintain these properties.- It seems like we're absolutely being overlooked and the single biggest criminal thing I think is going on with all this zoning is no one is looking at parking.- You have to put parking in.- If at some point in the future we have a magic bullet and everybody takes public transportation, fine, turn the things into living spaces or storage.- But build these buildings with parking.- Otherwise, keep it consistent.Brenda Lopez- I speaking on the 1-25 Division Street property.- I work for a small family owned building and we own the property at 1 through 25 Division.- We also built the brick style building at fourth and Townsend.- We are known for building high-quality mixed-use projects.- We all want to continue working and building here in the city.- We spent a lot of time acquiring this property on this site.- We were shocked at the new proposal prohibiting residential units.- Our relatively small company has spent approximately $10 million on investment in the property.- Before we purchased the Division Street property, we checked with our land use attorneys and found that the site at 1-25 Division Street had been zoned as residential in the first Eastern Neighborhood's map of 2003.- It remained as residential in the interim policies of 2004.- We are excited to develop the project because of the current condition of the property- We feel that we have been singled out due to the way the lines are drawn with the residential zoning on all three sides of our property.- The revisions on October 24th were the first talked about prohibiting residential on this site.- Immediately after learning of certain issues which all came after we bought the property, our company and our attorneys wrote letters to the planning staff and commission and we haven't had much response from that.- We ask you to make this process a bit more fair for us.C. J. Higley, Representative from Ruben and Junius- The drat interim controls designate our client's property as part of the employment and business development area, the PDR area.- We do not believe this designation is appropriate for this item and we respectfully request that you re-designate it for residential mixed-use so that the site can support productive transit oriented development.- The project sits immediately adjacent to what will soon be the Islis Creek stop.- The property is ideally suited for transit oriented development, where residents could step out of their homes and get right on one of the new trains.- In addition, the property has southern frontage on the creek, which has long been planned for recreational use.- There is already a boat landing directly across the creek from the project site; a sizeable public accessibility by the city immediately west of the site and there is money earmarked by the San Francisco Conservation Bay Development Commission to build more public access at the site.- This particular site was once the location of a sardine cannery.- The deteriorated buildings left on the site are now woefully under utilized - 133,000 square feet of industrial space.- Limiting this site directly on the Third Street Light Rail to industrial uses when it is unlikely to materialize in the future would squander the extra ordinary recreational opportunities that exist at this particular site.- It is for this exact reason that Planning Department staff has designated most of the lot headed north along Third Street with essential waterfront for mixed-use and not employment business development.- At the property owner's direction, the architects have prepared preliminary drawings for a project at the site with 30 dwelling units, 24,000 square feet of ground-level retail and over 66,000 square feet of usable open space as well as public access from Third Street to the Islis Creek.- In addition, the owners are working closely with Friends of the Creek who are also excited about the opportunity to provide access from Third Street to the Creek.- For all these reasons we respectfully request you take a hard look at this site and re-designate it to a use, a residential use that makes so much more sense at this site.Chris Durazo- I am opposed to the current interim controls.- This is about protections in civilization.- And this is not protecting who we want to protect - the fabric of the neighborhood - these smaller businesses.- Some are larger, but they have really made up the bulk of blue-collar businesses in the city.- There is a lot of stuff [small businesses] you don't see unless you know the neighborhood.- I think in particular these interim controls don't really protect those types of businesses.- The ones that are not successful to market trends.- They actually survive and have kept afloat the city during 9/11.- These were the businesses that kept families going.- The affordable housing concerns me, having everything grandfathered in.- The renters that are invested in this.- Those are the things we want real stronger protections on.Michael Burke-  We represent several property owner who would be affected by the Interim Controls- I want to address a number of discrete issues: 1) the grandfathering provision.  I'm not certain whether it's intended to apply to entitlement applications or to application for environmental evaluation. I would hope that it would include the latter as well as the former.  Otherwise you'd be turning CEQA on its head.  2) I would appreciate it if somebody would tell me what downtown office is so I could tell some of my clients what they can't do in their buildings.- I don't know what that means.- The limitation of 5,000 sq. ft. on office space does not really make a lot of sense to me.- I hope you will have at least one session where we can talk about whether certain land use designations are appropriate.- I would encourage you not to tie your hands with controls.- If you adopted interim controls that imposed alley restrictions on their development, it wouldn't make any sense.- If they were interim controls and not policies, you couldn't do anything about it.Robert McCarthy, on behalf of the Gardens at Harrison, on behalf of McGuire Furniture and on behalf of Fred Snyder- [He put a picture on the overhead]- That is Fred's site to the east, to the north, to the south.- It is completely surrounded by UMU.- In fact, the block to the west has been designated EVD except for the corner, which has been designated UMU.- I must tell you that this kind of zoning where you zone by the current use, and you do not zone by neighborhoods is not something that I have been familiar with in any planning process anywhere in t his State.- In fact, if you want to look at the two most glaring examples where block by block uses have differed dramatically, I recommend you take a trip to Houston or Bangkok, where you'll see high-rise shadowing, existing housing and all kind of other things.  They are the two worst urban planned cities in the World, and that is what is being proposed here.- What I'd ask you is that Fred be treated like the surrounding neighborhood and get included in the UMU because unfortunately Mission Linen is going to leave because they can't afford to pay their water bill.- Normally when planning is done, they first look to the natural boundaries - mountains, rivers, and creeks.- If you don't have those, you look for things that generally divide like freeways, boulevards, or some other construction for a freak from the park.- McGuire Furniture Factory is distinctly separate from the Eastern Neighborhoods.  It is clearly in Western SOMA.- It has always been treated as part of Western SOMA until suddenly this iteration of Interim Controls.- Finally, a little bit about the Gardens at Harrison.- This is under the topic of no good deed goes unpunished.- The market value of the Clay Studio, which by the way is a commercial lease, is $14,000 a month.- In order to help them with their transition, he did not raise their rent when the lease went up July 1st.- They are currently paying $5,000.- Similarly, the auto body people put $10,00- into their space and it is not going to get wasted because the brothers agreed to diminish their rent by an equal amount of money.- So in essence, the owners of the building pay for those tenant improvements and not the individual business.Jeffrey Leibovitz, Eastern SOMA- I thought the discussion was going to be a definition of PDR but it seems to be expanded quite a bit.- I thought there were going to be a series of workshops.- I got the impression that handouts were given to elicit comments and further discussion about permanent controls.- I would like a little explanation of that from staff please.- I want to encourage that there be a discussion on meaningful retail, meaningful ground floor retail and not just this cookie cutter 5,000 sq. ft. retail that seems to go unused as one of you noted.- We really need to make it start at 30,000 sq.ft.  I am referring to the East SOMA neighborhood.- 30,000 square feet, sub dividable so that we get some meaningful community serving retail to move in.- I can take you around our neighborhood today and show you vacant spaces that go under or unused because 5,000 square feet just doesn't cut it in these neighborhoods.- We don't have critical mass.Tom Gilberti- I live at 2 Townsend, the Marina Apartments.- I have rented there for 17 years.- Part of my issue is the noise.- The buildings create noise when they are finished.- Parking garages underground, ventilation systems, the remodeled warehouses, 625 2nd Street has ventilation systems on the roof.  They hum, they buzz continually.  Also, the emergency generators.- Just this morning 88 Townsend lost their electricity for about an hour.- It's about 100 plus decibels continuous noise.- When you look at these projects being built, make sure that the ventilation systems for the garage and common areas are quiet.- There is no sense in adding a bit of noise to the neighborhood where there once wasn't.- Each project may need to define whether it is going o allow dogs in residential areas now.- Unless a project of 400 or 500 units has its own private zone for its residents to walk their dogs, you're making the sidewalks and any parks in the neighborhood a dog park and a dog walk.- This is the moment you have to consider noise and dogs.- I wish you could take care of these problems.Tony Kelly- Commissioners, please do not be fooled.  This is not community based planning that we're doing here on interim controls.  These are City Hall based planning.- The longer you consider interim controls - the City Hall based planning, you are hurting the real planning that is supposed to be happening in the neighborhoods that has been stalled for years and we are still waiting for interim impact reports.- These Interim Controls don't stabilize the neighborhoods.- They don't offer an existing Planning Code.- They encourage speculation rather than protect existing businesses and existing jobs.- The change in definition of PDR, specifically defining what it isn't rather than what it is, Planning staff admits that that is different.- They are doing it because it is more flexible.- They admit they want to encourage uses they haven't thought of yet or may be higher density uses than what is there.- How is that operating within the existing Planning Code?- How is that being more restrictive rather than less?- You really have to think commissioners.- It is because Planning Department staff is either choosing or has been instructed to specifically introduce higher density business usage into the definition of PDR.- This would encourage more speculation in the neighborhood.- If you want to continue to have hearings about the permanent controls and about the proper use of the Eastern Neighborhoods, go right ahead.- But please for the sake of planning, you don't have to consider these interim controls to have the hearings.- Ditch these interim controls and instruct staff to come up with a more honest process that really respects the community based planning process.Sue Hestor- I support Interim controls.- But these are way far away from what they should be.- I want to talk about less restrictive.- From the map of residential mixed-use, a lot of this area is zoned SLI.- Guess what SLI doesn't allow?- Housing.- Why do we have interim controls that say residential in the SLI?- What we've had in the SLI over the last couple of years was 2,000 to 3,000 micro-based housing units that call themselves artist [units].- What we built in the SLI and Mission and Potrero Hill is about 4,000-artist live/work.- Now the developers are saying these artists workspaces are really housing.- And now you are being told that their sites are surrounded by housing.- Do you indulge a lie?- Are we going to say that existing artists live/work that is an industrial use that is required to be only sold and occupied by artists has changed, and we now recognize the lie legally?- That's is one of the issues the Department has not confronted.- I will give you what I believe downtown offices are.- Downtown offices per the Downtown Plan is, first you do a planning process and you invest about a billion dollars in infrastructure in transit, then you change the density and say, we have the super structure available to move people in and out of an area on transit.- People don't have to and shouldn't be able to drive to downtown offices.- When you switch that level of density to 2300 Townsend Street, for example, you are creating something that flies in the face of about ten years of planning that this Planning Commission wasn't involved in, but that the city was involved in.- We do not encourage density in areas that don't have transit first.- That means transit before the density comes in, as well as other parts of transit first.John Barrett, representing the property at 1025 Harrison- My family has owned this property for the past 60 years and I've managed it personally the last 25.- We have always kind of adapted to the needs of the city through running different businesses and then trying to accommodate the best tenants for the area.- We plan on building 572 housing units, 30% or which will be two and three-bedroom units.- This will generate $12 or $18 million in estimated BMR housing.- It will also increase property tax revenues to the City and County.- The restrictions under the interim controls are counter to the city goals of encouraging housing.- We ask the Commission to look at each development on a case-by-case basis and allow lot mergers where appropriate.- We want to make this, which is one of the major gateways to the city, something that we can be proud of and also future generations can enjoy.Alice Barkley- Your PDR designation has gotten to the point that it means absolutely nothing, except for what is not defined as a PDR.- 'But it is defined for everything else.- But I don't know what that everything else is.- This other control is not ready for prime time.- It needs a lot of work and it needs a lot of clarification and clarity.Hans Koch- I'm a developer and a member of the Dogpatch Neighborhood Association.- We are a neighborhood-first developer in that before a project we propose goes before you or even before staff, we present the property and the concepts to the neighborhood.- That is really a gauge for establishing receptivity in terms of the general climate about a particular development.- So we have this sort of mix with the neighborhood primed for a particular project, particular design that matches up with those things that have been identified in the Central Waterfront Plan and match up with the interim controls.- But we don't have a basis for which to proceed.- So we'd like to work together on solidifying that plan whether it is through the interim controls or through a quickly accelerated Central Waterfront Plan.- We want to move that process forward.- In establishing the Interim Controls in the short term, we also need to deal with things like density and height which are missed if we are moving towards the adoption of some of these permanent controls meaning that really address those issues.- So working through the specific property issues about zoning and what properties fall under what categories is important.- But working towards a greater goal, finishing up the plan, working with the neighborhoods and following the staff's plan of meeting and having these workshops to address some of the neighborhood issues is important, not only to the community, but also the city, owners and neighborhood, which are all pieces of the puzzle.ACTION:

SPEAKERS:Fred Snyder- This has been a 16 year process in our neighborhood- I would like to have the Planning Commission direct staff to work more closely with the neighborhood on these items.- We just got this document last night.- It rubs me the wrong way when I hear them say they held four community workshops.- The neighborhood was not invited at the beginning of them- When we got there we were told that the community had already decided what the plan was and was leading us in this plan B type situation housing.- We were brought into this after the fact.- That has been a problem from day one.- This has been a very bad process.- The community wants to work with the planning staff.- We want to resolve this.[Speaker did not state name]- I want to back up what Fred said.  This has been a long arduous process.- It doesn't seem like we are getting anywhere.  We're spinning our wheels.- I like your definitions of PDR.- How about definitions on a lot of other stuff?- I've always followed all the controls, to only have this thing sold down the road and to me diluted.- This is where it hurts.- Define something and stick with it.- I have a real issue with a lot of these grandfathering things.- And don't forget parking.- We're going to have an urban warfare out there.- Have you ever tried to ride BART late at night at 16th and Mission?- Bring your pistol.  You might get killed.- People need cars.- We have to have someplace to put them.- For Christ's sake, figure out something to do with it.- We need legitimacy.  It needs to be fair for everybody.- It's not.  It's out of control.
