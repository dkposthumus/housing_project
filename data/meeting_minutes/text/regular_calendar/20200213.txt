The FY 20-21 Budget Contract to study Housing Affordability – 
Alternate Models for $50k.

buildings that can been flagged to the Small Sites Program or could 
add an ADU to garage areas in single family homes. 
3. Demolitions that have CUA hearings make findings of what is 
Necessary and Desirable with Affordable by Design, increase in 
density by efficient use of interior space. Developers report on 
occupancy and tenure (both sale and rental) within 6 months of CFC. 
Applicable for ADUs. 
4. Demo Calcs for major Alterations by adjusting the Calcs to effectuate 
policy efficacy. Commission has the ability to adjust Section 317 (b) (2) 
(B) and Section 317 (b) (2) (C) per Section 317 (b) (2) (D).
