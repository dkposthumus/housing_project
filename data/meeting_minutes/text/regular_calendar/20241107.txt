30 VAN NESS AVENUE – northeast corner of Market Street; Lot 004 in Assessor’s Block 0835 (District 6) – Request 
for an Amendment to the Conditions of Approval of the Downtown Project Authorization for the project (the 
“Initial Project”) at 30 Van Ness Avenue previously approved by the Planning Commission on May 21, 2020, 
through Motion No. 20717 to allow the Project to no longer provide on-site inclusionary affordable units 
pursuant to a proposed Special Use District, which would remove the on-site affordable housing obligation in 
consideration of the Project Sponsor’s excess payment of development impact fees as compared to what would 
have been owed if the Sponsor had elected to delay issuance of building permits and qualified for the 33% 
impact fee reduction program adopted by the City in 2023 (Ordinance No. 201-23, Board file 230855). The

250-252 CUMBERLAND STREET – north side between Sanchez and Church Streets; Lot 046 in Assessor's Block 
3600 (District 8) – Request for Conditional Use Authorization pursuant to Planning Code Sections 249.92, 303,

area tantamount to a merger, the expansion of unit 252 to include the second through fourth floors, a 51%

SPEAKERS: 
= Maggie Laush – Staff report 
+ John Kevlin – Project sponsor presentation  
+ Stephanie Lim - Owner 
+ Rick Carrell – Approve with minimal conditions 
+ Georgia Schuttish – It is subjective to say the illegal Alteration sanitized facade of 
Cumberland by removing original shingles and distinctive clinker bricks. But it is 
objective to say this CUA shows why Flat Policy should be Codified. Findings on Flat 
Policy in Draft Motion p. 6 should be amended. This is an "Exceptional Circumstance”. 
As written in 11/5 email, families may use “living rooms” and “dining rooms” as 
sleeping spaces out of convenience and necessity. “An overly large one bedroom” is 
subjective description of original 250 Flat. Now is highly unlikely 250 Cumberland will 
ever be on the market for a separate family. For all intents and purposes the Flats are 
permanently a SFH with multiple bedrooms. Before the illegal work Flats sold for: $1.7 
million. After the illegal work SFH sold for: $6 million. This fact also shows reason why 
Flat Policy should be codified. See “Whereas” clauses Resolution 20024.
