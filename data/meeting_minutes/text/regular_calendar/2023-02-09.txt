3251 20TH AVENUE – Public Comment on the adequacy of the Environmental Impact
Report for the Stonestown Development project. The proposed project would redevelop
the approximately 27 acres of surface parking surrounding the existing Stonestown
Galleria shopping mall into a master-planned, multiphase, mixed-use residential and retail
community. Under the proposed project, the existing 775,000-square-foot mall would
remain, with changes to the façade, entrances, and exits. However, the parcels that
contain the shopping mall (Block/Lot 7295/038, 7295/004, 7296/005, and 7296/006)
would be rezoned as part of a proposed special use district (SUD). The existing parking
garage in the southwest corner of the project site, the vacant theater at the northwest
corner of the site, and the commercial building at the northeast corner of the site would be
demolished and redeveloped as part of the proposed project. The proposed project would
include up to approximately 2,930 residential units; up to 160,000 square feet of new retail
sales and service use space; up to 200,000 square feet of non-retail sales and service use;
up to approximately 100,000 square feet of hotel use; approximately 53,000 square feet of
institutional uses; approximately 4,250 parking spaces; and six acres of open space. The
proposed project would also include transportation, circulation, and utility infrastructure
improvements. The site at 3251 20th Avenue contains one historic resource, United Artists
Stonestown Twin Theater, for purposes of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
The project would result in significant and unavoidable impacts on Air Quality, Cultural
Resources, Noise, Transportation and Wind resources.
NOTE: The public comment period for this DEIR is from December 14, 2022 till 5:00 PM on
February 13, 2023.
