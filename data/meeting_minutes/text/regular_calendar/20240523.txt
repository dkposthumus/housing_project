- Georgia Schuttish – Project was a Demolition of sound housing from the beginning 
due to scope of work, not dry rot. Demo Calcs manipulated. See all the Matrices in 
submission sent May 17th. In order to legalize Demolition: Should there be two 
front doors for each Flat with direct egress to Elizabeth Street? Will the kitchens 
both be complete or will one be a large wet bar with a minimal stove? Is the interior 
space efficiently used? Should there be an ADU? Is there any possibility of the 
project being “affordable by design”? Should the original breezeway or 
Tradesman’s Entrance be preserved? Does the project need a parking garage since 
that requirement has been removed from the Code? Does this project as proposed 
comply with the housing goals for this High Resource Area? Or the housing goals of 
the Family and Senior Housing SUD? Does this project comply with the Residential 
Flat Policy?
