2025 DRAFT HAZARDS AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE PLAN – Informational Presentation – Staff will provide an 
informational presentation on the 2025 update to the Hazards and Climate Resilience Plan (HCR). The HCR is an 
action plan for building a safer and more resilient future in San Francisco by reducing the impacts of hazards such 
as earthquakes, landslides, and pandemics. The HCR also addresses the ways in which hazards like flooding, 
extreme heat, and wildfire smoke are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change. As the City’s 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-approved Local Hazard Mitigation Plan, it is required to be 
updated every five years for the City to be eligible for critical FEMA funding sources. Reference and adoption of 
the HCR in the Safety and Resilience Element allows San Francisco to be compliant with SB 379 and considered 
for additional state cost-share on eligible FEMA Public Assistance projects per AB 2140.
