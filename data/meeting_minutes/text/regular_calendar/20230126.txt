SAN FRANCISCO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE FRAMEWORK AND GENERAL PLAN 
INTRODUCTION  – Consideration of a Resolution to Initiate amendments to the San Francisco 
General Plan – Pursuant to San Francisco Charter Section 4.105, Planning Code Section 
340(c) and Section 306.3, the Planning Commission may consider adopting a Resolution to 
Initiate amendments to the General Plan, including adoption of the San Francisco 
Environmental Justice Framework and amendments to the Introduction to the General Plan, 
and schedule a public hearing to consider adopting the proposed General Plan 
amendments. This initiation hearing is to consider when the adoption hearing will be held. 
If the Planning Commission passes the initiation resolution, the Commission will consider 
the content at the adoption hearing date of their choosing. The Department staff propose 
the adoption hearing to be scheduled on or after March 2, 2023.

+ Angelique Tompkins –Within the EJ Framework draft it states:
Government should foster environmental justice through processes that
address, mitigate, and amend past injustices…With reference to 'past
injustices', it is essential that reparations context is included in the EJ
Framework. The draft references interagency partners responsible for
implementation of the policies and priorities. SF Human Rights Commission
is not explicitly noted as a resource although it is an essential body to
ensure environmental justice accountability. SF African American
Reparations Committee convened by SFHRC released their Reparations
Plan to which the Bayview Alliance contributed recommendations that

align with EJ Framework priorities.  The Bayview Alliance proposed 
objectives and actions were adopted verbatim into the Reparations Plan – 
Health – Objective 4 / Actions 4.2 & 4.3. We propose these 
recommendations are integrated into the EJ Framework with 
implementation responsibility to include SFHRC as a key resource as 
environmental justice is a human right matter.
