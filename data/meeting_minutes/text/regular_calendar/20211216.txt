CLIMATE ACTION PLAN AND COMMUNITY SAFETY ELEMENT – Informational Presentation – 
Staff will update the Commission on two critical and connected climate resilience efforts: 1) 
the release of the 2021 Climate Action Plan and 2) the process of the General Plan’s 
Community Safety Element update. The 2021 Climate Action Plan is data-driven, 
community-informed, and people-focused, with implementable strategies to achieve net-
zero emissions by 2040 while building a more just and equitable future. The Department 
supported and collaborated with the Department of the Environment, who developed the 
Plan, alongside many key partners, stakeholders, and over 19 public agencies. The 
Community Safety Element update will provide a comprehensive set of goals, objectives, 
and policies for minimizing San Francisco’s contribution to the climate crises and ensuring 
local resilience to multiple hazards. The proposed changes would add three goals to address 
1) equitable community safety, 2) multi-benefit climate resilience, and 3) governance and 
accountability. The update will comply with SB 379 and SB 1000, coordinate with the 2020 
Hazards and Climate Resilience Plan and the 2021 Climate Action Plan, and incorporate 
racial and social equity.

850 BUSH STREET– north side between Mason Street and Taylor Street; Lot 008 in Assessor’s 
Block 0274 (District 3) – Request for Conditional Use Authorization pursuant to Planning 
Code Section 303 for relief from the strict requirements of the Planning Code related to 
required dwelling unit mix (Section 207.7); height exceeding 50 feet in an RC District 
(Section 253); and bulk exceedance (Section 271). The proposed project (“Project”) involves 
a vertical and horizontal addition to the existing one-story with mezzanine structure 
previously occupied by a restaurant (Retail Sales and Service Use), resulting in a seven-story 
building. The existing structure, a contributor to the Lower Nob Hill Apartment Hotel Historic 
District, is approximately 19 feet tall, while the height of the building with the vertical 
addition would be 65 feet to the finished roof. The five-story, approximately 13,500 square 
foot addition, would include 21 dwelling units, comprised of seven one-bedroom units and 
14 two-bedroom units, with three affordable (below market rate) units provided. With 
residential uses located above, the ground floor would retain an approximately 1,850 square 
foot retail space. The Project includes 21 Class 1 and four Class 2 bicycle parking spaces, with 
no accessory off-street parking provided. The Project Site is located within a RC-4 
(Residential-Commercial, High Density) Zoning District and 65-A Height and Bulk District. 
This action constitutes the Approval Action for the project for the purposes of CEQA, 
pursuant to San Francisco Administrative Code Section 31.04(h).

and 714) and three waivers from: Bulk (Section 270), Rear Yard (Section 134), and Dwelling 
Unit Exposure (Section 140). The Project Site is located within the Broadway NCD
