POTRERO POWER STATION – the area generally bounded by Illinois Street on the west, 23rd 
Street on the south San Francisco Bay on the East, and 22nd Street on the north, Assessor’s 
Block and Lots: 4175/002; 4175/017; 4175/018; 4232/001; 4232/006; and non-assessed 
Port and City/County of San Francisco properties (District 10). This is an Informational 
Presentation on the proposed Potrero Power Station Mixed-Use Development Project, 
located in the Central Waterfront at the site of the former power station decommissioned 
in 2011 by then-owner Mirant Potrero LLC. Associate Capital/California Barrel Company, 
the project sponsor, seeks to redevelop the approximately 29-acre site for a multi-phased, 
mixed-use development, including new waterfront open space. The proposed project 
would rezone the site, establish land use controls and design standards, and provide for 
development of approximately 2,601 dwelling units, approximately 1,500,000 gross 
square feet (gsf) of office / life science/laboratory use, 241,574 gsf (250 rooms) of hotel use, 
50,000 gsf of community facilities use, 35,000 gsf of production, distribution, and repair 
use, 25,000 gsf of entertainment/assembly use, 99,464 gsf of retail use, 6.9 acres of publicly 
accessible open space, 1,862 bicycle parking spaces, and 2,686 parking spaces. Overall, the 
proposed project would construct up to approximately 5.3 million gsf of development. The 
proposed rezoning would modify the existing height limits of 40 and 65 feet to various 
heights ranging from 65 to 240 feet. The project would require amendments to the
