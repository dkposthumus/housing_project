          to construct a new single-family dwelling on a steeply down-sloping

          five stories at the rear in an RH-1(D) (House, One-Family (Detached 
          Dwelling)) District and 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and approve 
                the project with modifications
(Continued from Regular Meeting of April 14, 2005)
SPEAKER(S):
(-) David Levy - Representing 1stDiscretionary Review 
          Requestor
- They appreciate the changes that the project sponsor has agreed to.
- They appreciate the fact that the project sponsor put up story poles, 
          although some of the story poles were not accurate.
- This project should receive substantial modifications. The size of 
          the property is too large and it does not comply with the Residential 
          Design Guidelines. It does not meet the requirements of the Planning 
          Code. The building does not step down the hill; it would diminish light 
          and air; etc.
- They request that the Commission take Discretionary Review and either 
          deny the project or request modifications so that the project complies 
          with the Residential Design Guidelines.
(-) Katherine Woof - 2ndDiscretionary Review Requestor
- She reviewed the changes to the existing plans and is in accordance 
          with [most] of it. She still wants five feet to be removed from each 
          level.
(-) Mr. Zeneli - 3rdDiscretionary Review Requestor
- He knew that there were two legal easements recorded.
- The proposed building will put his house into a tunnel like situation.
(-) Arnold Rockford
- He lives on Clarendon Street.
- His main issues are the height and bulk of the building.
(-) Lawrence Ruff
- He is concerned about this project because the scope and scale is 
          not compatible with the neighborhood.
- He is concerned with the diminished light and air and how that will 
          affect him.
- The project sponsor should further reduce the height of the building.
(-) Richard Margaise
- He is opposed to the project because it is a "monster" 
          home and is out of character with the neighborhood.
- He is surprised that the Planning Department would consider a plan 
          that violates easements.
(+) Jim Reuben - Reuben and Junius
- This is a completely code compliant project.
- There are no exceptional or extraordinary circumstances here.
- The lot is very small and extremely slopes down hill. It is difficult 
          to have enough space on each floor.
- There have been a lot of discussions and negotiations.
(+) (did not state name)
- He has known the project sponsor for many years.
- The project will provide much-need housing for the City.
- The project sponsor is a great builder.
- There have been several changes to the plans since the project sponsor 
          met with several of the neighbors.
(+) Mark McCoin
- He agrees with the previous speaker.
- When the neighbors see what type of quality building this will be, 
          they will agree with the project.
(+) Lou Barberini
- The project will fit into the neighborhood and actually enhance it.
(+) (did not state name)
- The project sponsor has helped him with many projects and is not 
          a liar either.
(+) Lou Balance
- The work that the project sponsor does is excellent craftsmanship.
- The project on Clarendon will be quality craftsmanship as well.
(+) Brian McGee
- The project sponsor is constructing a code-compliant building.
- The Commission should consider that the project sponsor has come 
          a long way.
(+) Greg Clark
- He is a fourth-generation San Franciscan.
- He looked at the legal documents regarding the easement and he did 
          not understand it.
- This project will be a hope that a family can live in.
- It is not right to limit a person to provide space to live in instead 
          of living in boxes.
ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and approved the project per staff 
          recommendations: Require a three foot setback at each floor; a three 
          foot side setback at lower crawl space, remove stair penthouse and provide 
          a hatch.

          additions to the existing single-family dwelling at the first and third 
          levels. The ground floor rear addition would extend the rear building 
          wall approximately six feet and the third floor rear addition would 
          extend the third level rear building wall approximately 13 feet 6 inches. 
          Both additions would be set back three feet from the north side property 
          line in an RH-1(D) (Single-family Residential, Detached) District and 
          a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve 
          as proposed.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Jeremy Paul - Representing Discretionary Review Requestor
- He does not agree with staff's report.
- The proposal is not code compliant and requires multiple variances.
- The site conditions are not discussed in the project report.
- Lot coverage is made irrelevant; therefore, plans are inaccurate 
          and misleading.
(-) Sara Estroquen
- It is an unfortunate beginning for a neighbor-to-neighbor relationship.
- The proposed expansion would detract form the character of the neighborhood.
- The area of their home where they spend the most time is the one 
          that will be most affected by the proposed construction.
(+) Nigel Burns - Project Sponsor
- He wants to do a very modest project.
- He would like to construct a master bath and a kitchen on the ground 
          floor.
- The concerns of the Discretionary Review requestor are of air and 
          light and the suggestions by staff would decrease that impact.
(+) Sherril Cooper Burns
- She and her husband were delighted to find this house.
- They have small children and having more space will allow them to 
          live there for many years.
- Her mom and her husband's parents will be staying with them for extended 
          periods of time.
ACTION: Take Discretionary Review and approve with modifications by

Preliminary Recommendation:  Approve Draft Resolution
(Continued from Regular Meeting of April 21, 2005)
NOTE:  See Above
SPEAKER(S):
Sue Hestor
- Regarding the proposed language on the construction progress requirement:  this is a dilemma the Commission always faces.
- She suggested that the Commission require automatic calendaring in two years of any case that has a time limit.  Otherwise it never gets calendared and can never be revoked because it is not on the calendar. This is a frequent problem with conditional uses.
- Regarding the housing needs:  She is continually troubled by the failure to break out above moderate.
- The poblem is that the Commission does not have very good information even when the sales prices information is readily available.
- One can get it at the Assessor's office.  A planner can get it there as well.
- Also, there should be no in lieu fee.  The in lieu fee in the code is based on things all over the city.  All of these units are going to be way high-end compared to the rest of the city.
Chris Durazo - SOMECAN
- She thinks that it would be wonderful to have fees for luxury units.
- People cannot go from rental housing to these luxury units.
- She is concerned about the new affordable construction type.
- There should be an advocate for the South of Market.  It is important to have family housing.
Reed Diment - Rincon Hill Homeowner's Association
- The Commission should consider Inclusionary housing in each project.  This would involve the Commission's participation and look at this project-by-project.
- The money raised should be for Rincon Hill exclusively.
Steve Vettel - Morrison and Forrester
- Regarding the Meloroose District - it should not be the cause of the delay of this project.
- The language should stay the same as currently drafted.
Lou Blazej
- He echoed Steve Vettel's comments.
- There is a notion to amend Section 315 to function on a square footage basis at a residential level.
Azalia Merrill
- Laborers make about 50 percent of the median income.
- She appreciates Commissioners comments regarding affordability.
- She agrees with "grandfathering" the 375 Fremont Street project because it will provide 50 to 80% of affordability.

The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public comment, the commission is limited to:
(1)  responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or
(2)  requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or
(3)  directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.  (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))
