SAN FRANCISCO GATEWAY PROJECT (749 TOLAND STREET AND 2000 MCKINNON AVENUE – the approximately 
17.1 acre site is bounded by Kirkwood Avenue to the north, Rankin Street to the east, McKinnon Avenue to the 
south, and Toland Street to the west; lot 008 in Assessor’s block 5284A, , and lot 002 in Assessor’s block 5287, 
(District 10) as well as portions of the surrounding streets and Selby Street; an elevated portion of Interstate 280 
bisects the site – Public Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Report. The proposed project would 
demolish the four existing single-story buildings and construct two new multi-story buildings that would 
provide new production, distribution, and repair (PDR) space in the city. Each building would be approximately 
97 feet tall and would have a maximum height of 115 feet, including rooftop appurtenances. The two new 
buildings would total 2,160,000 gross square feet.  The proposed project would convert Kirkwood Avenue (along 
the northern side of the project site, between Toland and Rankin streets) to a single-lane, eastbound one-way 
street; and convert a portion of McKinnon Avenue (along the southern side of the project site, between Toland 
and Selby streets) to a single-lane, westbound one-way street. Streetscape improvements would be 
implemented surrounding the project site. The project site is within a PDR-2 (Core Production, Distribution, and 
Repair) Zoning District and 65-J Height and Bulk District. The proposed project would require approval of a height 
and bulk district map amendment, a development agreement, and establish a new special use district 
designation modifying the PDR-2 zoning.  
The Environmental Review Officer has extended the public comment period.  Written comments will now be 
accepted at CPC.SFGatewayProject@sfgov.org or at the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m. on October 16,
