2026 LOMBARD STREET-Hearing on the Appeal of a Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration.The proposed project includes the construction of a four-story, 40-foot high, 97-room tourist hotel containing approximately 49,000 sq. ft. of hotel area and the demolition of the existing two-story, 30-room tourist hotel/motel of approximately 8,630 gross square feet (sq. ft.).  The 13,613 square-foot lot is located on the north side of Lombard Street between Fillmore and Webster Streets (Assessor's Block 0492, Lot 25) in the Marina District of San Francisco.  Vehicular and pedestrian access to the project would be from Lombard Street.  The existing hotel/motel is currently operating, and is a legal non-conforming use as it was constructed in 1955, prior to neighborhood commercial zoning controls.  The project site is in an NC-3 (Moderate-Scale Neighborhood Commercial) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.  The proposed project would be required to get Conditional Use Authorization for the hotel use from the Planning Commission under Sections 712.55, 712.11 and 712.21 of the Planning Code.
