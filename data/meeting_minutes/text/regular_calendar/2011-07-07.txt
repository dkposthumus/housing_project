COMMUNITY VISION FOR SAN FRANCISCOâS NORTHEAST WATERFRONT- On July 8, 2010, the Commission acknowledged the work of Department staff in 
completing the Northeast Embarcadero Study and recognized the design principles 
and recommendations of the study for public realm improvements and new 
development in the area. At that same hearing, the Commission also urged the 
Port of San Francisco to consider the principles and recommendations of the 
Northeast Embarcadero Study when considering public infrastructure improvements 
in the study area. Separately, a citizens group prepared its own study entitled 
âA Community Vision for San Franciscoâs Northeast Waterfrontâ and has requested 
that they be given the opportunity to present their work to the Commission. It 
is this groupâs study that is the subject of this informational presentation.

THE 34THAMERICAâS CUP AND JAMES R. HERMAN CRUISE TERMINAL AND NORTHEAST WHARF PLAZA 
BRIEFING-Informational Hearing
-34thAmericaâs Cup Project Description:The 34th Americaâs Cup project 
sponsorsâthe City and County of San Francisco (CCSF) and the Americaâs Cup Event 
Authorityâpropose to host the 34th Americaâs Cup (AC34) sailing races in San 
Francisco Bay. A series of AC34 yacht races would be held in San Francisco Bay 
in 2012 (Americaâs Cup World Series) and in 2013 (Louis Vuitton Cup, Americaâs 
Cup Challenger Series; potential Americaâs Cup Defender Selection Series; and 
the Match). Several of the venues proposed for the AC34 events are piers, water 
areas, and facilities managed by the Port of San Francisco (Port) including: 
Piers (Piers 19, 19½, 23, 27-29½, 26, 28, 30-32, and 80), water basins/water 
areas (Piers 9, 9-15, 17-19, 19-23, 23-27, 29‑31, 14-22½, 26‑28, 28-30, and 
32-36), and Seawall Lot 330.  Various other venues are proposed for 
spectator‑related activities, some of which are under the jurisdiction of other 
city, state or federal agencies, including Crissy Field, Marina Green, Fort 
Mason, Aquatic Park, Alcatraz Island, Fort Baker Pier at Cavallo Point (near 
Sausalito), San Francisco Civic Center, Union Square, and Justin Herman Plaza. 
The event venues would include team bases and operations, support space, media 
operations, hospitality services, sponsored commercial space, entertainment and 
spectator areas, and temporary berthing and mooring facilities for race-related 
and spectator vessels. Most of the facilities would be temporary and removed at 
the conclusions of the events, although certain permanent infrastructure 
improvements would be required at some of the proposed venue sites within the 
Port's jurisdiction. The proposed project also includes a number of 
implementation plans that address transportation management, waste management, 
parks coordination and management, sustainability, water and air traffic, public 
safety, youth involvement, and workforce development. The project would also 
require amendments to the Special Area Plan (SAP) adopted by the Bay 
Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC).
- Cruise 
Terminal Project Description:The Port of San Francisco proposes 
the development of Pier 27 as the James R. Herman Cruise Terminal and Northeast 
Wharf Plaza, which is proposed to be phased to allow proposed Americaâs Cup 
Village uses at Piers 27-29, including an initial phase of the cruise terminal 
building, for the 2013 Americaâs Cup races. The Cruise Terminal project would 
involve demolition of the existing Pier 27 shed, a portion of the Pier 29 shed, 
and Pier 27 Annex Building. The remainder of the Pier 29 shed would be retained 
and rehabilitated, and the Belt Line office building would be retained. Proposed 
improvements to complete the cruise terminal and wharf plaza would be built out 
after the AC34 races are concluded. The proposed two-story cruise terminal 
building would be approximately 91,200 square feet in size and would occupy a 
footprint of approximately 46,100 square feet along Pier 27. The Pier 27 cruise 
terminal would be designed to handle vessels carrying 2,600 to up to 
4,000 passengers. The cruise terminal would include an approximately a 3-acre 
ground transportation area, which would be located in the center of Piers 27-29, 
to support access, drop-off, and exiting by trucks, taxis, buses, and passenger 
vehicles to meet both ship provisioning and passenger loading needs of the 
cruise terminal. The cruise terminal would also accommodate other uses between 
ship calls, such as public or private gatherings, and maritime-oriented events. 
The Northeast Wharf Plaza would provide an approximately 2½-acre open space at 
the south end of Pier 27, fronting along The Embarcadero promenade and would 
include a multi-use recreational space containing natural turf; pavers, concrete 
seating/steps and planters; and ancillary structures for commercial and 
recreational services. The cruise terminal and wharf plaza project would also 
require amendments to the SAP adopted by BCDC.
Preliminary Recommendation: Informational only; no Commission action.
