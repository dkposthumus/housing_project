O'SHAUGHNESSY DAM DISCHARGE MODIFICATION PROJECT- O'Shaughnessy Dam is located at Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, in Yosemite National Park (Tuolumne County).  The area is accessed by Camp Mather Road off Highway 120.Appeal of a Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration. The project consists of modifying the piping at O'Shaughnessy Dam that controls discharge to the existing 108-inch Canyon Power Tunnel pipeline (or penstock) at the base of the dam, and the downstream water transmission system. The piping modification involves construction of a new 60-inch pipeline to allow withdrawal of water from a higher level in the reservoir, to be used when turbidity in the reservoir is above the allowable level.  The project also involves demolition of the lower valve house.  The purpose of the project is to improve the water quality and water supply from Hetch Hetchy Reservoir to the City and Country of San Francisco and its water customers by constructing a second higher outlet to the aqueduct from the reservoir.
Preliminary Recommendation:  Uphold Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration
