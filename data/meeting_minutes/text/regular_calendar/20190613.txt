Project, located immediately west of City College's Ocean Campus, east of the Westwood 
Park neighborhood, and south of Archbishop Riordan High School (Block and Lots: 
3180/190, owned by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission). The Balboa Reservoir 
site is among the first sites slated for San Francisco's Public Land for Housing Program, which 
utilizes City-owned land to address the City's most pressing housing issues. After a 2-year 
outreach, visioning, and selection process, a developer team was chosen to partner with the 
City on the development of the 17-acre Balboa Reservoir site. The proposed project would 
rezone the site, establish land use controls, develop design standards, and provide for 
development of residential, commercial, parking, community facilities, and open space land 
uses. The proposed project would include amendments to the General Plan and Planning 
Code, creating a new Balboa Reservoir Special Use District.
