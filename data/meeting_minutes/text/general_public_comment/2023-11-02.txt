SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – Residential Flat Policy needs to be codified with objective design 
standards preserving original configuration of existing flat. Residential Flats shouldn’t 
be remodeled out of existence as shown by example which had an exponential 
increase in sales price in year and a half…over 63%. The tenant that lived in the upper 
Flat no longer does. Hallways including the original layout of rooms which are usually 
located at either end of the hallway and with separate rooms located off the hallway 
should be preserved including the original layout of kitchens which are generally at 
the rear of the Flat. Original configuration, layout should be preserved in order to 
prevent loss of housing that is rent controlled. Additionally, per Findings in Resolution 
No. 20024 Residential Flats are a typology of housing that “satisfies a number of 
housing needs, particularly for middle-income families”. Permits approved/issued 
within weeks of application for this project.
