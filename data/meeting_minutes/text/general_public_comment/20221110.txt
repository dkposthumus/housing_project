SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – Re: Email w/photos sent November 8th. The project 
on the left in the photos applied for the Permit in June 2012. It was issued 
in May 2014. The CFC was issued in 2016. There was a complaint filed with 
DBI in January 2015 for work beyond the scope contending “the building 
is completely demolished”. The case was quickly closed contending the 
contractor was “in compliance”. However, the Matrix on the SFPIM 2013 
plans does not conform to Section 317 template. Additionally the Vertical 
Area Calculations do not account for the corrections made to the 
Clarifications in the June 2020 Section 317 Code Implementation 
Document. The project on the right in the photos applied for the Permit in 
December 2014. It was issued in July 2017. The CFC was issued in 2018. 
The two adjacent projects were after the Joe Eskenazi December 2012 
article.
