SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – Policy Efficacy and Objectives of the General Plan and the 
Planning Code Sect. 317 regarding loss of dwelling units – aka Demolition, 
Tantamount to Demolition or De Facto Demolition- 
What is the Policy?? 
The General Plan recognizes that existing housing is the greatest stock of rental 
and financially accessible residential units and is a resource in need of protection. 
Please adjust the values to promote efficacy through non-legislative updates. The 
Zoning Administrator has done this in the RH-1, three times since 2015. The 
Commission has not – ever – used the powers allowed by section 317(b)(2)(D). 
The Commission should now a most important criterion for permitting demolition 
is relative affordability. 
Please ask the City Attorney if the Commission can adjust the values three times as 
the Zoning Administrator did in the past three years to correct the failure to 
improve policy efficacy going forward. Or, please do it once, at least.
