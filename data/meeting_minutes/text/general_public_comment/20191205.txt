SPEAKERS: 
Christen Evans – 1672 Haight Street 
 
 
Georgia Schuttish – Spec projects, kitchen space 
 
 
Kitchens in Spec Projects not using space efficiently. 
Creating restaurant-like spaces, Large square footage = expensive homes, loss of 
Relative Affordability.  
Food delivery trends mean kitchens less for meal preparation and food storage = 
wasted sq. footage. Could densify either with horizontal expansion and unit/ADU 
on ground level or a vertical expansion owhich tends to = demolition have a 
second unit upstairs.  
Extreme Alterations like this have same consequence as Demolition. Example 
shown did not comply with Staff requests for required Demo Calcs even after two 
NOPDRs….final plan’s Calcs look “squishy”. Example similar to five samples from 
2015 where 40% should have been reviewed as Demolition per Staff.  
Very difficult for Enforcement. Must be inspected by Staff at just the right time 
during construction to get proper assessment.  
Much better to have strict assessment at intake with less liberal Demo Calcs or 
some other Demolition definition to achieve Relative Affordability.
