SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – Project examples emailed February 23rd and March 2nd show 
loopholes in codifying Flat Policy. Flats were extensively remodeled from standard 
stacked Flat layout with complete reconfiguration of rooms and relocation of flats to 
different floors within structure. March 2nd email shows sliding door linking Flats. Total 
interior wall Demolition of 73.64% per plans at DBI Records. Examples shown today: 
Two pairs Flats recently sold, now under review. One example: Flat wrapped around 
other. Odd reconf iguration also expands “vestibule” into a “common foyer”. Other 
example: Project originally wanted to take advantage of Section 317 (b) (7) by 
relocating one Flat behind garage: Reason why Flat Policy was necessary to prevent 
sham units and de facto mergers. This project is like example sent February 23rd with 
second kitchen relegated to closet-like space. Must have strong code language to 
properly codify Residential Flat Policy for outcomes to meet Policy Findings and 
Housing Element.
