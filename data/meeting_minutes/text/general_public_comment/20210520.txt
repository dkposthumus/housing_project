Georgia Schuttish – Email sent on 5/18 shows two side by side Alteration 
projects. One sold for $9.5 Million, one for 8.7 Million. These are spec 
projects. Both were unoccupied for over six years. Calcs did not cross the 
thresholds BUT were within a few percentage points of doing that for 
both projects. Projects like the two in the photos are not like 49 Hopkins,

Street, 4112 21st Street, 79 Cragmont, 403 28th Street or 292 Eureka Street 
or 2027 20th Avenue or any of the others that need corrective action by 
the Commission. Two projects shown in the email used the loophole of 
the current Demo Calcs to avoid greater scrutiny by the Commission/Staff 
and the public. Projects do not comply with the Code and General Plan. 
Calcs need adjusting per Section 317(b)(2)(D).
