SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish - CUA hearing legalizing Cumberland TTD raised 
questions needing answers. Why was project reviewed as alteration when 
three thresholds were exceeded in 2017 Demo Calc Matrix and fourth was 
close? Why did 2019 Cumberland plans also use Article 10 thresholds, 
when house had been down-graded to “C”? Why did 20 Raycliff Terrace, 
designed in Second Bay Tradition, A-rated contributor not have Calcs 
measured against the Article 10 thresholds? Why was design revision for 
Raycliff alteration allowed during 2020 Enforcement Action to be just up 
to, but not over 317 thresholds, thereby avoiding the CUA? Why have 
there been so many Alterations, primarily speculative projects, often 
selling the Entitlements, having issues with the Demo Calcs, accepted and 
approved by Staff contrary to the intent of Planning Code Section 317 as 
stated in the Findings at Section 317 (a)? And why have the Calcs never 
been adjusted per Section 317 (b) (2) (D)?
