SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – Excavations to create Basement units are “negative” 
vertical expansions, creating spaces with questionable livability, 
problematic egress: A bad template for densification in RH neighborhoods. 
A better template for Alterations: Is adding a unit in a typical RH house by 
horizontal expansion into the rear yard and efficient use of interior space to 
create a three bedroom family home on one level. The open plan which is 
dominated by the kitchen is inefficient. Design can efficiently included 
three bedrooms with hallways and lightwells/setbacks. The existing garage 
level can be converted into a unit with proper egress to the street and a 
shared rear yard, to meet the open space requirement. Preserving rear 
yards mitigates climate change. Garages are no longer Code required. 
Existing curb cuts could be retained per MTA for street parking. 
RDAT/Staff/Commission should promote this template in seeking 
densification especially to developers and speculators and flippers.
