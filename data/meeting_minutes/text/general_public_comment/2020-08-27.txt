SPEAKERS: 
Katherine Howard – Articles on toxic building site on Green Street 
San Francisco gave CEQA categorical exemptions to nine projects located on state-
identified toxic waste sites. Local residents appealed the Green Street exemption.  
"Despite the pending appeal, the San Francisco Department of Public Works 
allowed work to begin this week and expects it to conclude on Friday."  
Apparently, this action has been sanctioned by the Planning Department. (SF 
Chronicle) 
 
CEQA attorney Richard Drury says, “In the 30 years I’ve been doing this I have 
never seen anything like it. We are in the midst of an appeal process, and they are 
short-circuiting the elected officials...” 
 
These actions by the City illustrate concerns with how the misuse of CEQA might 
be supported by the proposed Standard Environmental Requirements (SER).   
SER will have a negative impact on transparency and public participation in the 
CEQA process. We need a strong CEQA process.  Please oppose the SER Ordinance.
