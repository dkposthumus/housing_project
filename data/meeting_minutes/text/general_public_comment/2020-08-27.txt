SPEAKERS: 
Katherine Howard – Articles on toxic building site on Green Street 
San Francisco gave CEQA categorical exemptions to nine projects located on state-
identified toxic waste sites. Local residents appealed the Green Street exemption.  
"Despite the pending appeal, the San Francisco Department of Public Works 
allowed work to begin this week and expects it to conclude on Friday."  
Apparently, this action has been sanctioned by the Planning Department. (SF 
Chronicle) 
 
CEQA attorney Richard Drury says, “In the 30 years I’ve been doing this I have 
never seen anything like it. We are in the midst of an appeal process, and they are 
short-circuiting the elected officials...” 
 
These actions by the City illustrate concerns with how the misuse of CEQA might 
be supported by the proposed Standard Environmental Requirements (SER).   
SER will have a negative impact on transparency and public participation in the 
CEQA process. We need a strong CEQA process.  Please oppose the SER Ordinance.   
Georgia Schuttish – At the DR Hearing on May 18, 2017, neighbors asked for two 
simple changes: To protect neighbors’ light and air, keeping separation on the 
property line, eliminating minuscule amount of expanded square footage. Also 
not allow a fourth floor which violated RDGs. Neighbors requests were reasonable. 
The owner and architect stated it wasn’t a speculative project but a family home. 
1647 Sanchez sold for $9.1 million last month upon completion. At the hearing, 
one Commissioner said it was an inefficient use of space. And it was a Demolition. 
Another Commissioner wanted two equal sized units. Another Commissioner 
wanted to approve it as an Alteration because that would keep the second very 
small unit rent controlled. If the Calcs had been adjusted at least once since 2009 
per the code it would have been a Demolition because Calcs so close to Section 
317 thresholds. Please adjust the Demo Calcs.
