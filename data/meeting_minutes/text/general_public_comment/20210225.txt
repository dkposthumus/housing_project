SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish - Two attachments w/background info on Demolition vs. 
Alteration issues. Please read. One is the DBI/Planning Staff Handout for 
4/12/2018 joint hearing on Demolition. Pages 5-13 are info on Section 317 
TTD. However, no mention of Section 317 (b) (2) (D) which empowers CPC 
to adjust the numerical values of the Demo Calcs. Page 15 reads, “Building 
permits for vertical additions are the most common source of unauthorized 
demolition”. Would a descriptive or qualitative definition of TTD work 
better in Section 317? For example: Vertical and Horizontal Expansion with 
Facade Alteration/Removal = TTD. Or would adjusting Calcs resolve TTD? 
Second attachment is five pages, memo to BIC/Planning Commissioners for 
4/12/2018 joint hearing with suggestions for dealing with Demolition. Also 
includes 2015 email correspondence with DBI and Planning Staff regarding 
“Alterations” and problems.
