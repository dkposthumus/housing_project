SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – DR withdrawn for 428 Collingwood. Expansion of stair penthouse 
to enclose roof deck. History of project: Look at before and after photos. Original house 
sold December 2014 for $1.875 million, nearly $700k over asking price of $1.195 
million from one week earlier. This is the start of the Major Alteration frenzy taking 
advantage of Demo Calcs to Demolish housing. Application made in 2015. Three 
NOPDRs required to get Demo Calcs. No Calcs on SFPIM. Calcs questionable due to 
outcome of project? Or is the issue that the Calcs should have been adjusted twice by 
2015 since set in 2009? Project completed/sold December 2017 for $6.2 million. Sold 
again May 2022 to LLC for $7.7 million. Original house was perfectly livable and sound. 
It looked like housing all over the City and in the PEGs. Housing Element requires 
Protection of housing. Adjust Demo Calcs per Section 317 (b) (2) (D).
