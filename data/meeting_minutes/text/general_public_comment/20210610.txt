SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – Projects that are extreme alterations all have the 
same characteristics. 6/8 email from me to CPC: A typical example. 
Expensive upon completion. $5-$7 million dollars increase from prior to 
work….even as high as $9 million in a couple of cases. Speculative Flips. 
The outcome: Same as a Demolition. But without the scrutiny….or the 
label. Extreme/Major Alterations have horizontal and vertical expansion 
and complete facade change. Interiors are gutted. Often full lot 
excavation. They are not existing housing. They are new housing. New 
Housing is more expensive….less relatively affordable….less financially 
accessible than existing housing. Often no published Demolition 
Calculations for these extreme alterations..…or very close to the 
thresholds. 
The 
thresholds 
of 
the 
Calcs 
have 
never 
been 
adjusted….although Staff in 2009 informed CPC adjustment might be 
necessary. Regardless of training DBI per Director Hillis’ 6/10 statement: 
TTD Demolition Calculations should be adjusted.  
Linda Chapman – Conditional Use, negative impacts
