Georgia Schuttish – February 12th email focused on continuing reverberations from 
fact that Section 317 Demo Calcs never been adjusted as Commission has the 
legislative authority to do under Section 317 (b) (2) (D). Implications for the two new 
citywide SUDs. Priority Equity Geographies SUD vulnerable. 2022 Feasibility Studies. 
SFH with added unit are most feasible. May be greater incentive to bypass 
Commission getting Ministerial review as Alteration in PEGs and even on Westside. 
Intent of Section 317 Tantamount to Demolition values was preventing Alterations 
becoming Demolitions. Building Code 103A.3.2 skirted around. Section 317 
conceived to allow reasonable remodels, preventing Demolition of sound housing. 
Staff has said adjusting the Calcs would just cause speculators to go up to the edge 
of any new threshold if values were reduced. Great! Because less structure removed 
means more will be retained. Less Speculation, more existing sound relatively 
affordable, financially accessible housing preserved. Protecting tenants, UDUs.
