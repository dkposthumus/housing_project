Georgia Schuttish - The October 21st Executive Summary from Staff 
analyzing SB-9 said on page 10 the Department was working on a 
Financial Analysis of viability of SB-9 development scenarios. And it would 
be done in late October. This would be good information for the 
Supervisors to have from the Department’s housing experts. On page 12 
of the October 21st Executive Summary was a list of neighborhoods. Most 
of these are in the southern part of the City which are fundamentally all 
RH-1. One of my concerns when raising the issue of the Demo Calcs was 
the housing in these neighborhoods, particularly the Excelsior, becoming 
a Noe Valley with extreme Alterations that had the same outcome as 
Demolitions….loss of existing relatively affordable housing with high-end 
housing. Whether it’s predatory actions that lead to cashing out or 
evictions from single family homes, measures are needed…..quickly…..to 
prevent this.
