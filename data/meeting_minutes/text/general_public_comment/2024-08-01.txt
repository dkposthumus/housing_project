SPEAKERS:  
Georgia Schuttish – “For many years Section 317 review was often lax.” “While there may be 
greater scrutiny during review in more recent years as can be seen by the addition of the 
“warning letters” and additional Staff review, along with the 2020 revisions to the Part 4 
"Clarifications and Notes” in the Section 317 Code Implementation Document, the 2009 values 
in Section 317 (b) (2) (B) and (b) (2) (C) are not stringent enough. The Demolition Calcs should 
be adjusted per Section 317 (b) (2) (D).” “The Commission has the legislative authority to adjust 
the Demo Calcs and it is concerning for existing sound housing in all San Francisco 
neighborhoods, but most particularly for the existing sound housing in the neighborhoods of 
the Priority Equity Geographies, that this has not happened.” “And it is also concerning that 
the Commission has never even had a discussion about the possibility of using this authority.”
