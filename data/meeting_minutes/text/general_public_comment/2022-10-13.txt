Georgia Schuttish – October 12th was anniversary of Commission 
approving Residential Flat Policy. Vote to approve it was 5 to 1, Some of 
the extreme Alterations involving Flats created “Monster Homes” by 
absorbing one flat, reduced in size, relegated to a location behind the 
garage. This was facilitated by Section 317 “loophole” beyond Demo Calcs 
not being stringent enough because the Calcs have never been adjusted 
as the Commission has the Legislative Authority to do per Section 317 (b) 
(2) (D). The intent of the Policy is to prevent housing from “disappearing” 
by being absorbed into the larger unit. Which would mean the loss of a 
FLAT, which is likely to occur when a FLAT is relocated within a structure. 
Exposure and location of the Flats within the Structure are as important as 
size in preserving this typology of housing going forward, particularly 
since the Draft Housing Element proposes to codify this Policy.
