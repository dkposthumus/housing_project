SPEAKERS: Georgia Schuttish – November 7th Hearing showed video when 235-237 Jersey Street 
Flats sold for $1.58 Million in 2015. Both flats were tenant occupied and were lived in 
with three bedrooms in each Flat. We saw all the belongings of the tenants, including 
two baby cribs. Both flats were very livable. November 14th hearing showed video of 
completed Alteration when sold in 2020 as 235 Jersey Street (one address) for $7.5 
million. Layout from 2020 sale shows internal connection. The downstairs “kitchen” 
more like a party room that a separate living space. (There is a separate issue of the 
Demo Calcs for 235-235 Jersey. Demo Calcs still in effect in the PEGs) Very important 
that when the Residential Flat Policy (Resolution 20024) is codified per Housing 
Element Action 8.3.2 that Flats maintain their location within the structure and 
maintain their configuration as true Flats. Otherwise loophole under Section 317 (b) 
(7) will persist.
