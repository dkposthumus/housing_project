RE: June 5, 2019 Planning Letter: 
“ADDENDUM 5 to Environmental Impact Report” (from Lisa Gibson for John 
Rahaim) 
 
“2019-006081ENV”/“BOS File 190437: 
NON-DISCRETIONARY REVIEW of 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING and TEACHER 
HOUSING PROJECTS” (introduced by Mayor Breed on April 23, 2019) 
 
This Addendum Letter -- for 100% affordable and employee housing for SFUSD 
and Community College District employees -- states said housing will only need 
Planning’s ministerial review, limit discretion, change Planning Code, and Business 
and Tax Regulations Code, and is approved as part of the 2004/2009/2014 Housing 
Element FEIR.  It alludes to SB 35 (streamlines, removes CEQA requirements) & AB 
2162 (by-right supportive housing). 
 
Why was this Addendum Letter formalizing environmental conclusion in advance 
of File 190437 still pending BOS Committee action? 
Will this be coming before this Commission? 
What nexus might this have with ballot initiatives on the same matter?
