Georgia Schuttish – Please review CPC Docket 06.0070 ET Noe Valley: The 
epicenter for De Facto Demolition according to the Staff. And if one thinks 
about an epicenter, reverberations ripple out from the epicenter. One 
Example: Original pair of Flats and original SFH in photos shown during 
General Public Comment. Both are Spec Projects. During work on Flats, 
scope of work exceeded and determined to be TTD. If the Calcs had been 
adjusted, Flats could have been preserved and could be occupied now.

During the work on the SFH the Calcs were revised. They were very close to 
the thresholds. If the Calcs had been adjusted, SFH could have been a 
simple Alteration, not high-end, high-priced, Spec project. In Section 317 
(b)(2)(D) adjusting the Calcs by reducing the values, is not counting pieces 
of wood. Rather it is preserving housing: Allowing for reasonable 
Alterations per Code and General Plan.
