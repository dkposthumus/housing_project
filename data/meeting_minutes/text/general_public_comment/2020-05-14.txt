Georgia Schuttish – 1/23/20 hearing, demo calcs 
On SFGOVTV on January 23, 2020 at 3:56:25 following Public Comment 
regarding the budget, President Koppel asked Former Director Rahaim: 
“Just a quick question, if there is one thing I have heard more than 
anything —— those Demo Calcs ——— just the Demo Calcs…..” 
(President Koppel emphasized “Demo Calcs” because Former Director 
Rahaim interrupted him…thinking he was asking about development on 
the Westside) 
Then President Koppel continued:  
“Is there someone who can take a look at it?” 
Former Director Rahaim said he was “not the expert, but that Liz Watty is 
looking at it in the context of the larger issue of Demolitions and that sort 
of thing.” 
What I wish Former Director Rahaim had advised was: 
“Commissioners, you can adjust the Demo Calcs for policy eﬃcacy at 
anytime. Section 317 (b) (2) (D) is in the Code, as needed, to preserve and 
protect existing housing and relative aﬀordability.”
