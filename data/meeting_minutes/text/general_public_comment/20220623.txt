SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – Email sent 6/23 at 11 am points out troublesome 
phrase in Section 65850.02 (a) from AB 916 which is a “back door” to getting 
rid of both DR hearings and specific CUA hearings.  “Adding space for 
additional bedrooms” is not the same as “reconfiguring existing space”, 
which is the supposed intent according to Staff in Sacramento. Elimination 
of DR hearings and CUA hearings for Demolition of single family homes 
should not be done by walking through a “back door”, but should be in 
noticed public hearings in San Francisco.  As decision makers in San 
Francisco please resolve this “back door” issue with the folks in Sacramento. 
Please read my 6/23 email if more info is needed.
