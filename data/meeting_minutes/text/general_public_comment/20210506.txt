SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – Approximately 20 Noe Valley projects had full 
hearings either as MDR or CUA since Section 317 was implemented in 
2008. Staff may be worried if the Demo Calcs are adjusted per Section 317 
(b) (2) (D) (which is a tool the Commission is empowered to use) the 
Commission will be inundated….flooded with CUAs. The intent of Section 
317 was not to limit Commission hearings but to preserve sound housing 
while allowing for reasonable Alterations that did not veer into illegal 
Demolitions. That is the policy because existing housing is more 
affordable…or Relatively Affordable. 41 Clipper approved as an Alteration 
in 2013 is like so many other Noe Valley projects illustrating the fact that 
housing has been “prioritized as a commodity rather than a human right.”
