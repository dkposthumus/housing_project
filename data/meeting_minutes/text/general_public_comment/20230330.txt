SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish - Compare 1647 Sanchez and 403 28th: One was a

been accepted. Staff’s stated rationale for never adjusting Calcs since 2009

is project sponsors (or developers and speculators) would just go up to 
edge of any new, adjusted thresholds, avoiding CUA. “What is wrong with 
that?” Isn’t that the point of the Demo Calcs? If Calcs had been adjusted, 
with thresholds made more stringent wouldn’t all housing, like 28th 
Street, that should have been preserved, been saved? And housing like 
Sanchez Street wouldn’t have become an unoccupied, multi-million 
dollar, behemoth. Demo Calcs should have been adjusted. They still 
should be adjusted, in order to objectively save sound, livable housing. As 
Housing Element is implemented, hopefully will use a butter knife, not a 
meat cleaver on existing housing stock.
