SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – Illegal real estate activity: 
• Adjust Numerical Demolition Criteria, Section 317(d)(D) which the 
Commission can do without legislation. 
• Amend Numerical Demolition Criteria, Section 317(d)(B) and 317(d)(C) to 
replace the word “and” with the word “or” between the numerical criteria. 
This would require legislation that would be relatively simple for the 
Commission to propose and could possibly resolve issues surrounding 
Tantamount to Demolition. 
• Amend Demolition Criteria in Section 317 to make sense…some criteria 
should be N/A, if a building is sound and habitable, such as Sect. 
317(g)(5)(C)(A) and (B). [aka Section 317(d)(3)(C) i and ii in the “Zoning 
Controls on Demolitions”]. Another simple fix. 
• Request the Zoning Administrator adjust “value” for Administrative 
Approval of Demolitions in RH-1 Districts. Or eliminate it per RET draft. 
Apparently revised upward to $1.9 million on December 15, 2017.
