which was an Informational Hearing on the 2020-2022 Budget. There are 
two public speakers….myself and a gentlemen talking about developing 
the Westside. After that, Former Director Rahaim responds to the question 
from Former President Koppel about “some way to take a look” at the Demo 
Calcs?. That starts around 3:56. This portion of the video with the answer to 
Former President Koppel’s question is pretty quick. Former Director Rahaim 
says Ms. Watty is looking into the issue of the Demo Calcs in the context of 
other issues. However the Planning Commission can adjust the Calcs. Two 
years later this is still true, regardless of whether hearings remain remote 
or whether or not Ms. Watty has “looked into” the issue of the Demo Calcs.
