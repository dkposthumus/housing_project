Street projects with “squishy” Demo Calcs that had an average price increase for 
these speculative projects of about $5.5 million. This is neither financially 
accessible, nor relatively affordable housing. Regardless if the Sup. Peskin split file 
for the Demo Calc values from the Sup. Mandelman amendment to Section 317 for 
RH-1 Demolitions is resurrected, the Commission can institute an adjustment to 
the Demo Calcs from where they currently are set using Planning Code Section 317 
(b) (2) (D) and an announced start date. This effective date for new applications 
would be the same as when proposed projects in the RH-1 knew when the ZA 
would institute a new monetary value and those projects acquired the necessary 
credible appraisal for Administrative Approval for a Demolition.
