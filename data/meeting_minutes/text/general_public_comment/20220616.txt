Georgia Schuttish - Page two of 4/23/20 Executive Summary, for Case 
#2020-003035PCA discusses the intention of “protecting relatively 
affordable housing” per the Findings of Section 317. The intention was 
abandoned and dismissed by the Department because according to Staff 
the “initial policy goals” of Section 317 were not achieved. What was not 
mentioned was that the tool to achieve these “initial policy goals” was 
never implemented. That tool would have been advising the Commission 
to adjust the Section 317 Thresholds enumerated in this Executive 
Summary and the in Planning Code as the Commission has the legislative 
authority to do per Section 317 (b) (2) (D). Section 317 (d) (2) (A) was 
adjusted five times. The Demo Calc’s Thresholds……NEVER. Average 
increase in sales price for projects submitted for this Public Comment: 
$4.158M. Photos submitted document the failure of the Department to 
properly advise the Commission on implementation of Section 317.
