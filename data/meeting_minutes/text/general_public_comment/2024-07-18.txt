SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – Suggestions to solve HOUSING CRISIS during the REZONING. 
There has been a continuum of demolition and mergers (de facto and actual) and 
loss of sound housing throughout City for years. • Adjust the Demo Calcs which the 
Commission has the legislative authority to do, to better preserve sound existing 
housing. • Codify Flat Policy preserving Flats in original location and configuration 
for family housing typology. • Enforcement/prevention on front end, not after 
violation. Projects approved with a second unit or ADU should be built as approved 
with full kitchen and separated internally. • Have SB 423 Ministerial Approval for two 
units of market rate housing rescinded as this is a major loophole for high end 
housing that has been driven through by previous projects for years. • Reduce 
amount of interior wall removal allowed in Alterations particularly if the property is 
determined to be sound. Certainly for A-rated Historic Resources this should be so.
