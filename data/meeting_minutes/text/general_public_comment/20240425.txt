SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – How can existing housing in PEGs be protected and preserved 
so as not to have projects like two 2014 examples in 4/23 email? Codify Residential 
Flat Policy, preserve flats in their original location within a structure and in their 
original configuration. This is Action 8.3.2, identified with a “short” timeline another 
way is to adjust Calcs. “Constraints Reduction” specifically talks about “planning 
processes”. Current values of Calcs are “planning processes” that can lead to 
speculative development that does not “….prevent the potential displacement and 
adverse racial and social equity impacts…” Sales history of examples in 4/23 
email….these price increases mirror increased housing costs of past decade per 
“Constraints Reduction” Findings. Beyond adjusting Calcs to make more stringent, 
consistent and accurate review of Demo Calcs by Staff and Commission is necessary 
as two examples in email show. 2014-style projects using Calcs loophole should not 
happen in 2024 PEGs.
