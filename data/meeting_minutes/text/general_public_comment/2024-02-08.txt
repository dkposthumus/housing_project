SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – 2515 Folsom Street CUA hearing has facets reflecting 
Constraints Reduction Ordinance and issues that will be before Commission with 
Rezoning. Key lots are issues. Adjacent lot w/TICs 2981-2983 21st Street concerned 
with roof decks, stair penthouses, parapets becoming issues. Two roof decks for just 
two of Folsom units. Roof open to entire building. Access to decks not clearly 
exclusive based on plans. Project sponsor did not want to lower parapet because 
children using the open space on roof decks could fall. Objectively are roof decks 
good open space for children? Should family housing provide the required open 
space in the rear yard at grade? Objective standard for stair penthouses RDGs pages 
38-39, includes objective standards for parapets. Workforce housing. Workers living 
in Folsom currently, not when finished. High-end, expensive, market rate housing 
in the Priority Equity Geographies? 21st Street: Codifying Flat Policy, original 
location and configuration. Adding an ADU.
