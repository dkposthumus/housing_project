Georgia Schuttish – The 2020 illegal Demolition at 403 28th Street is a case 
of behavior defying policy. The document “Executive Summary for Hearing 
on May 17, 2007” says on page 7, “Applicants who would otherwise apply 
for a demolition permit have attempted to avoid review under the 
Commission’s policy by configuring their projects to comply with the 
technicalities of DBI’s determination of a project as an Alteration rather 
than a Demolition. This draft ordinance defines demolition independently 
of that determination, so that projects that propose removal of substantial 
portion of their building envelopes will be subject to the requirements of 
Section 317”. Section 317 requirements implemented policy approved in 
2008 to correct this bad behavior. The 2016 Staff Training Manual tried to 
thwart bad behavior. Adjustment to the Calcs is required to deal with policy 
defying behavior. The existing Calcs are too large. They require reduction.
