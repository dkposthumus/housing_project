SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND SHOULD BE ADJUSTED to more stringent levels per 317 
(b)(2)(D). See handout: Reduced values “year two”. Planning and DBI should not 
allow revisions that skirt policies. Best solution is to adjust the Demo Calcs and 
encourage second unit/ADU within existing sound structure. No garage required 
per Planning Code makes this possible.
