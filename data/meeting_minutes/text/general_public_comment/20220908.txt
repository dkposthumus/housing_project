SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – Please see email sent on August 29th to Commission 
that includes forwarded email from October 2018. Please watch General 
Public Comment on SFGOVTV for October 4, 2018, and October 11, 2018. 
Please watch Commissioner’s query to Staff on October 4, 2018 on 
SFGOVTV starting @ 26 minutes. Submitted “Lists” of projects are not 
comprehensive, but suggest extent of problem and need for Commission 
to use Legislative Authority granted in Planning Code Section 317(b) (2) 
(D). Since 2009, Demo Calcs should have been adjusted at least twice if 
not thrice. Still imperative to do in light of speculation that could occur 
post-Pandemic 
and 
during 
proposed 
rezoning 
of 
Residential 
neighborhoods. Enforcement not a panacea. Since ZA and Enforcement 
Staff are now folded into Current Planning, this Enforcement’s expertise is 
available to be implemented on “front-end”, not-post construction when 
damage is done and policy has been thwarted by developers/speculators.
