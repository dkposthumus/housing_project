Georgia Schuttish - Sometimes both the Flat Policy and Section 317 Demo 
Calcs apply to the same project approved as Alteration. The Flat Policy 
needs to be codified, preserving the original configuration of existing 
Flats, so as not to be absorbed or obliterated in residential neighborhoods 
throughout the City as has happened for years despite Planning 
Commission Resolutions 16053 from 2000 and 17264 from 2006. And 
despite Section 317. Any newly proposed Flats or additional units, even 
ADUs, will need strong review and oversight to truly expand housing 
opportunities. Preserving existing Flats in the original configuration also 
needs the right policy and proper oversight just to simply maintain 
existing housing opportunities. And certainly that is true with the Section 
317 Demo Calcs. If they are not adjusted, they will continue to be a 
loophole for speculative development, slipping through any incentives 
devised to increase density. See Planning Code Section 317 (b) (2) (D).
