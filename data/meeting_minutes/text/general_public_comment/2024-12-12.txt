SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – Section 317 never implemented as intended because Tantamount 
to Demolition Demo Calcs in Section 317 (b) (2) (B) and Section 317 (b) (2) (C) never 
adjusted. When Exemption Section 317 (d) (3) (A) was eliminated by legislation in the 
Spring of 2020, Department contended: “…Section 317 does not serve its intended 
goals of retaining relatively affordable housing stock, nor does it necessarily result in 
projects that are more in-keeping with neighborhood character”. Before Exemption 
was eliminated, was adjusted five times over ten years due to increase in housing 
prices due speculation. Never the Calcs. Soundness Exemption in Section 317. How 
many Soundness Reports past 10.5 years? New Exemptions added to Section 317 
under legislation from outgoing Mayor, Section 317 still grants legislative authority to 
Commission to adjust Demo Calcs to “further the efficacy of Section 317” as stated on 
Department documents. Housing for Residents of PEGs neighborhoods needs 
protection/preservation.
