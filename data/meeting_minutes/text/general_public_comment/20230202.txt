SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish â€“ The Demo Calc Matrix is an easy way to translate what 
the drawings of the design on the plans show. Design issues are the 
purview of Planning Department. Plans show the scope of a project 
including: What of the existing structure will be removed and what will be 
retained for an Alteration project. A Demo Calc Matrix is MATH. Not 
complicated, not absurd. Architects and engineers are highly educated 
needing to be good in math to put their official stamp on the plans for 
review. Department should assume the information provided on the plans 
in the drawings and as translated by the Demo Calc Matrix, is trustworthy 
and reliable. It should be a straightforward and honest process. The loss of 
existing, sound housing is unfortunate. It is unfortunate that the Demo 
Calcs were never adjusted even one time since 2009 to make the process 
more straightforward and honest as intended..
