SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish - Project on Sanchez Street: Very close to thresholds for 
Demolition Calculations, yet was approved as an Alteration. Project made 
a lot of money for the developers: Did not add to the housing stock of San 
Francisco: Sitting empty for years. Loophole created: Demo Calcs have 
never been adjusted. DeFacto Demolitions: Not intent of Section 317 
Legislative authority of Commission under Section 317 (b) (2) (D): Was 
intended to prevent deFacto Demolitions. Submitted: “Scenarios” show 
how Commission can adjust Demo Calcs. ZA adjusted the Demonstrably 
Unaffordable values five times due to the rapid escalation in sales 
price/cost of housing throughout the City. Commission should have used 
legislative authority in concert with the ZA to adjust the Demo Calcs. 
Should use Section 317 (b) (2 ) (D) now. Logic of California Court of Appeal 
decision in Tehlirian et al v. CCSF: Unassailable. See: Ten page Court 
decision submitted with letter and “Scenarios”
