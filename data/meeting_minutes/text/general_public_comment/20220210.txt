Georgia Schuttish - The photos of the Alteration projects illustrate/amplify 
issue. Four are SFH, not yet completed. One recently sold for $5.6 million. a 
flip of about $4.4 million and may have had a UDU. One is in District 9, the 
others are in District 8. One way to stabilize the housing market: Shifting 
the paradigm on incentivizing density, could have been and could still be: 
Adjusting the Demo Calcs per Section 317 (b) (2) (D). Two Commissioners 
raised issue at hearing two years ago. If the Calcs had been adjusted at least 
once and probably twice —- the incentive to avoid MDR and later CUA 
could have incentivized retaining more of a structure, not becoming 
“Alterations” like the ones in the photos which may be TTD. As Section 317 
intended there could have been modest, reasonable expansion with 
relative affordability and could have included an additional unit or 
preserved existing second unit.
