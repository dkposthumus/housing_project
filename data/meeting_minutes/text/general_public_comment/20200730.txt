SPEAKERS: 
Tess Welborn – Housing category, non-existing housing 
Georgia Schuttish – The intent of Section 317 (b) (2) (D) was to allow for the 
adjustment of the Demolition Calculations. It allows the Commission to respond to 
the market and preserve financial accessibility while preserving housing. 
Screenshots were emailed to the Commission on July 29th of the project at 271 Fair 
Oaks Street which sold in March 2020 for $6.3 Million. The previous sale in 2014 was 
$1.65 Million. This is an increase of $4.65 Million. The project's Demo Calcs were not 
published on the SFPIM, however this is a complete transformation and is a new 
building. The original building had a UDU behind the garage that was removed. This 
is now a very large SFH. This project was gutted, had a two-level vertical expansion, 
a horizontal expansion and a facade obliteration. Projects like this and many others 
illustrate why the Demo Calcs should be adjusted.
