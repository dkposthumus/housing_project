SPEAKERS: Georgia Schuttish – Discussion between Director Hillis and Commissioner Williams on 
CUA for Wisconsin project 10/10/24 was important. Commissioner Williams brought 
up issues never dealt with regarding sound and livable housing, whether a CUA or 
major Alteration project. Needs thorough discussion rooted in history about 
Soundness as Section 317 was developed two decades ago. Director Hillis framed 
Section 317 goals incorrectly. Overly large homes and increasing density are not point 
of Section 317. They are byproduct. Section 317 is about words in Code. Look at 
Findings in Section 317 (a) and Section 317 (b) (2) (D) which has not been implemented 
as intended. Section 317 has tool that has never been used. Commission should 
preserve existing housing for reasons enumerated in Findings and use legislative 
authority to adjust values of Demo Calcs to prevent Alterations becoming Demolitions. 
Protect PEGs per Housing Element. Commission should hold public hearing on 
adjusting Demo Calcs.
