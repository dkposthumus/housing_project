No mailed notice given to Western Addition organizations despite 3 AAU buildings 
on boundary of Western Addition. 
AAU has been out of compliance with SF law – particularly around requirement to 
file IMP and receive public input. AAU illegal use of housing has deprived residents 
of housing. 
The public deserves the ability to speak.
