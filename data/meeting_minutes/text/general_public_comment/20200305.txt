Georgia Schuttish – Roof Deck Policy on website 
 
 
Roof Deck Policy not found on CPC Website. 
 
 
Official Roof Deck Policy stalled since 2018. 
Roof Deck should be defined as: “open space on the uppermost area of a structure 
requiring a stairpenthouse or a hatch for access”. 
 
Plans conflate this with a “roofdeck” that is off living space, created by setbacks 
that reduce the mass, particularly setbacks overlooking rear yards. These should 
be called “terraces” per Dictionary definition.

Roof Decks that require stairpenthouse or hatch should not be permitted on 
smaller projects if open space requirement can be met though preservation of 
natural, carbon capturing rear yards.
