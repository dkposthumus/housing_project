SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – April 15-16th WSJ article on housing supply (“How any  
Homes the U.S. Really Needs”) raises questions that should also be raised 
regarding RHNA numbers forced on San Francisco during implementation 
of Housing Element. Other important issue raised in article is affordability. 
The housing crisis in San Francisco is a crisis of affordable housing, 
particularly for people/families at the lower AMIs. Other issue raised in 
article is not only building new housing, but preserving existing housing. 
Unfortunately Section 317 TTD adjusting values to preserve housing never 
happened, despite Commission empowered with legislative authority per 
Section 317 (b) (2) (D). 2014 Housing Element never fully implemented. 
Existing housing is “cheaper” per article. This is common sense. Preserving 
housing: Codify the Residential Flat Policy preserving the existing 
configuration of Flats. Preserve UDUs. Additionally: SF Entitlements are for 
sale. 
Housing

buy-outs,

commodification. See examples submitted with article.
