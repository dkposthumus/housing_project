SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – The email sent June 18th is of two Elizabeth Street 
projects. The photos show: Before, During and After. These projects were 
approved as Alterations. The existing houses were livable, not dilapidated, 
not shabby. No published Demo Calcs for one project; other one had the 
Demo Calcs revised during the work. These projects show why the Demo 
Calcs thresholds should be adjusted per Section 317 (b) (2) (D). The sales 
history of each shows why too. The rampant speculative market when both 
homes hit the market back in 2015 is illustrated by increase in sales price
