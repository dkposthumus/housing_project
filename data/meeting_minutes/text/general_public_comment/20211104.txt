SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – because the Calcs for these two projects were squishy. 
And although the Calcs for these two projects did not cross the threshold 
they were very close, and originally submitted Calcs were very different. 
Staff back in 2015 reviewing photos of a sample of five Noe Valley 
Alteration projects thought 40% were Demolitions. 2015 sample used the 
original Demo Calcs, the same Demo Calcs that precipitated these 
warning letters. In the past the Commission would not demolish sound 
housing. Staff calls Noe Valley the epicenter of de-factor demolition of 
sound, relatively affordable housing. There have been at least 39 
speculative Alteration projects since 2014, that should have been 
reviewed as Demolitions that were flipped for an average price increase of 
$3.9 million. It seems reasonable to say this speculation has a ripple affect 
across the City. The Demo Calcs need adjusting.
