SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – Supervisor Mar, quoted in the current Richmond 
Review said three new market rate buildings in the Sunset are basically 
empty. “Zombie Buildings” has been nickname for market rate condo 
buildings in the SOMA, meaning they are basically empty of occupants. 
Each unit in these large multi-unit buildings approved in the past decade+ 
in SOMA and Upper Market receives a bill from the Water Department for 
usage. Looking at the agglomerated bills for a sample for these market rate 
buildings to get a real feel for full time occupancy. Or if these market rate 
buildings are not occupied full time. Please re-read the RDGs. Light, air, 
privacy, site design, building scale, architectural features, building details 
and neighborhood character are all things that can be seen…and seeing 
something is objective, not subjective. Please read 12/13 email
