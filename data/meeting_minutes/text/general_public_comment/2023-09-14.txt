SPEAKER: 
Georgia Schuttish – September 9th email: Shows why Flat Policy should be codified 
preserving Flats in original configuration without relocating the flat. Codifying will 
strengthen intent of Planning Commission Resolution 20024. Unoccupied since 2015. 
Remains unfinished. Original spec proposal wanted to create mega mansion by 
moving one Flat behind garage. DR filed 2017. Public suggested Flats be maintained 
in original configuration, ADU added behind garage, using original tradesman’s 
entrance. Per Commission, upper Flat revised into one bedroom which can become 
“party room” with wine fridge and wet bar, getting CFC. Later wall comes 
down…..illegal merger….mega mansion Better to keep Flats in original 
configuration, incentivizing ADU to use entire garage by keeping curb cut allowing 
street one car parking. Enforcement needed for project during construction: Exceeded 
Demo Calcs due to extreme Alteration requiring CUA in 2019. CUA approval: Two stacked 
Flats, adding ADU. Codifying Flat Policy will preserve/create housing, forestall 
evictions.
