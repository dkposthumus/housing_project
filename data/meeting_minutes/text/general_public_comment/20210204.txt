Georgia Schuttish - At March 26, 2009 hearing on SFGOVTV, item No. 9, Staff 
presented first Section 317 Code Implementation Document. Staff note 
indicates they planned to: “….return in a couple of months on the first year 
of operation of Section 317 and may make recommendations for 
adjustments of some of the thresholds that the code empowers you to 
make, particularly the thresholds for alteration projects that are 
tantamount to demolitions.” This handwritten note (copy) was submitted 
with February 3, 2021 email to the Commission. On January 23, 2020 after  
public comment on the 2020 budget regarding Housing Affordability, the 
President of the Planning Commission inquired about the Demo Calcs, 
asking the former Planning Director, “Is there some way we can take a look 
at it”? In a 2015 sample, 40% of the five Noe Valley projects analyzed should 
have been reviewed as TTD per Staff review using the original 2009 
unadjusted Demo Calcs.
