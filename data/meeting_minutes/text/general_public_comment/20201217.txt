SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish - Extreme Alterations as show in 25 projects have 
common characteristics Looks like a Demolition…or at least what common 
sense would tell someone what a Demolition looks like. Have horizontal 
and vertical expansions with facade obliteration/ change. Usually raise 
original house off foundation. Have extensive full lot excavations removing 
great amount of soil, sanitizing rear yard removing carbon capturing ability, 
often requiring underpinning of neighboring foundations. Always have an 
inefficient use of interior space creating large kitchens surrounded by 
ancillary living space. Ground or subterranean levels are either fifth 
bedroom or media room with wine fridge and wet bar type set up as second 
unit “kitchen”. Mostly spec projects flipped upon completion or 
entitlements sold midway through prior to CFC. Not reviewed by 
Commission. Demo Calcs either not provided to Staff or adjusted during 
work. Relative Affordability and Neighborhood Character lost at site. 
Increased development pressure…. price inflation.
