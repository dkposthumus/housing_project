Georgia Schuttish â€“ Going forward the Residential Flat Policy must be 
codified. Flats should be maintained in their fundamental existing 
configuration to preserve this typology. The Resource Survey prepared a 
report on Residential Flats that is a good resource. It is also an 
entertaining read that is very informative. Additionally, efforts must be 
made to preserve second units and existing in-laws and/or UDUs. If these 
units, which are widespread throughout the City are in need of upgrading, 
funds should be made available to facilitate this during Alteration projects 
to preserve this housing. If there are existing kitchen facilities these 
should be enhanced. Loss of existing housing, whether Flats, Second 
Units, In-Laws, or UDUs that could be financially accessible and livable 
housing is a resource that should be discouraged as the City moves into 
the next decade.
