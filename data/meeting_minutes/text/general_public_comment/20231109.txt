SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – The Findings in Resolution 20024, the Flat Policy clearly state the 
reasons and need to preserve Flats. Flats are recognized as a typology of housing which 
“satisfies a number of housing needs, particularly for middle income families”. Letter sent 
on November 8th with attachments highlights the loss of housing and the dramatic 
increase in prices when Flats are not preserved. Also 11/9 correction email. 10/28 email 
discussed at 11/2 General Public Comment about altered Flats where there had been 
a tenant, who no longer lived there. Current Flat Policy needs teeth to better preserve 
existing Flats. It is necessary to have strict, objective design standards to preserve Flats in 
their original configuration and location within the structure (i.e. hallways) to insure the 
intent of the Residential Flat Policy (Planning Commission Resolution 20024) beyond 
the egress/exposure requirements when codifying the Policy to better preserve 
existing housing.
