SPEAKERS: 
Michael Petrelis – A complaint against Jonas P. Ionin and the Planning 
Commission has been filed with the Sunshine Ordinance Task Force for 
what I believe was a violation of open government laws. At your Sept. 29 
hearing, without proper agendizing, Ionin verbally proposed a joint 
meeting with the Historic Preservation Commission about the Castro 
Theatre in December. He claimed to have polled that commission and 
they agreed to the joint hearing, which you all agreed to without 
objection. Ionin alleged the public wouldn’t want to queue two days in a 
row to offer public comment, yet we the people were not given any 
advance notice of his effort to reduce two opportunities for us to petition 
our government to one. The public must be given many chances to speak 
at City Hall about saving the interior integrity of the Castro Theatre, before 
Another Planet is allowed to begin renovations. 
Georgia Schuttish – February 20, 2014. Since then there have been 18 
different Commissioners. Winter 2015 former Commissioner requested re-
review five Alterations. Conclusion: 40% were TTD. Staff decides Section 
317 was inadequate: In 2016 proposes RET with would have eliminated 
any definition of Demolition in the Planning Code. Spring 2020: Section 
317(d)(3)(A) was removed. One Commissioner suggested eliminating the 
“ands” in TTD definitions. January 2020: Another Commissioner told by 
former Director “Staff is working on it” when asked about Demo Calcs.  
October 2021 Two other Commissioners asked for an Informational 
Hearing on Section 317. Early 2022 was proposed by current Director. 
Every week the Commission confronts the housing crisis. The Commission 
should please discuss their legislative authority granted under Section 
317(b)(2)(D) since it is a tool intended to be used by the Commission to 
preserve exiting housing. Existing Housing is: Financially Accessible. 
Relatively Affordable. Rental Housing.
