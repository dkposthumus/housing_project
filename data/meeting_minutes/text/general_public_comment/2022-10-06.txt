SPEAKERS: 
Michael Petrelis – A complaint against Jonas P. Ionin and the Planning 
Commission has been filed with the Sunshine Ordinance Task Force for 
what I believe was a violation of open government laws. At your Sept. 29 
hearing, without proper agendizing, Ionin verbally proposed a joint 
meeting with the Historic Preservation Commission about the Castro 
Theatre in December. He claimed to have polled that commission and 
they agreed to the joint hearing, which you all agreed to without 
objection. Ionin alleged the public wouldn’t want to queue two days in a 
row to offer public comment, yet we the people were not given any 
advance notice of his effort to reduce two opportunities for us to petition 
our government to one. The public must be given many chances to speak 
at City Hall about saving the interior integrity of the Castro Theatre, before 
Another Planet is allowed to begin renovations.
