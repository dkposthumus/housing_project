SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish â€“ For the past few weeks, I have been requesting codifying the 
residential flat policy and creating objective design standards to preserve existing flats 
in their original configuration of rooms, defined by the hallway and in their original 
location within the structure. It is important to preserve flats, not only for tenants that 
may occupy them and could be removed even under the flat policy, but also for any 
future tenants/occupants seeking housing that satisfies the housing needs outlined in 
the flat policy findings in resolution 20024 approved on October 12, 2017. The flat 
policy recognized the importance of this typology of housing in San Francisco for 
middle income families. There are flats throughout the city in high resource and 
priority equity neighborhoods. Please codify the policy with objective standards that 
preserve this typology of housing as written in the emails as the city enacts the housing 
element.
