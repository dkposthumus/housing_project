SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – Is drop-off in 311 Notifications due to economy or due to 
change in Code Requirements under Constraints Reduction Ordinance that went 
into effect January 14, 2024? What is impact of this drop off? Two projects that were 
extreme Alterations. 21st Street project found to be TTD. Units merged. Needed CUA 
from Commission to legalize and abate merger. No Demo Calcs found, but Staff did 
request them during 2015-2016 review. Diamond Street project no material 
uploaded to SFPIM. Review at DBI Records found Questionable Calcs. Accelerated 
price increase from 2014 – 2021-2022. No relative affordability. Question: Do 
current threshold values in Calcs allow for reasonable remodel? Or do they facilitate 
speculative projects? Going forward: Demo Calcs should be adjusted per 
Commission legislative authority in Section 317(b)(2)(D). Flat Policy should be 
codified per Housing Element Action 8.3.2. Is Planning now in charge of intake 
review of plans, not DBI?
