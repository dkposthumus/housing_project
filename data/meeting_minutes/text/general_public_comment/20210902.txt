Georgia Schuttish – This extreme Alteration creates a basement unit with 
poor exposure, questionable egress, underneath the garage. Very bad 
template to densify existing housing. Could have been done faster using

existing house, with horizontal expansion only. Instead it veers into a 
Demolition, using too many resources to construct the subterranean unit, 
also causing the loss of a natural rear yard. This is environmentally 
questionable. The Commission does not deal with excavations…that is the 
domain of DBI….However a design needing a major excavation, with an 
extreme Alteration in the RH neighborhoods… and a rear yard turning into 
a cement patio means: Commission/Staff should consider this issue for 
future projects. For comparison when this project was under review the 
plans said the excavation was 36 cubic yards….the final approved 
structural plans said it was 1200 cubic yards…130 Townsend will remove 
1500 and 1700 cubic yards each per their plans.
