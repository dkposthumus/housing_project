SPEAKERS: 
Sue Hestor – Planning is not following its own Rules & Regulations on 
submissions of staff reports AND time limits for public testimony.   
Commission RULES require that staff packets are due one week in advance 
of hearing.  THURSDAY before p.m.  Today they are only available when 
Agenda comes out late Friday afternoon.  Too late for public to read and 
submit comments to Commissioners.   
Public testimony is also truncated. Rules provide for 3 minutes for 
individual comments. When there has already been one hearing, Rules 
provide that President may exercise discretion.  Usually done for second 
hearing on project.   Recently ONE MINUTE time limit imposed on FIRST 
hearing on 468 Turk project.   
Remote hearings are difficult on everyone.  Commissioners. The public.  
What should be 3-hour meeting, becomes 5 hours.  Speakers often hard to 
hear.  Difficult to present visuals. 
Please calendar for discussion returning to City Hall for Commission 
meetings.
