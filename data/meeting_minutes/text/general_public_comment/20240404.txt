SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – Two emails sent. One on March 26, 2024 and another on April 
1, 2024. Details public comment: background/history of issue with Demo Calcs since 
2015. RET not advanced. Peskin legislation not advanced. Demo Calcs never 
adjusted. Project in March 26 email at 1363 Sanchez illustrates “cashing out” which 
is a concern expressed by the Staff in 2021 analysis of SB-9 in the neighborhoods 
now in PEGs. Thirty year tenant in 1363 Sanchez “evicted” due to sale in 2017. Sold 
for $1.7 M followed by “extreme alteration”. Sold for $4.3 M in 2023. Should also be 
of concern in the Well Resourced Neighborhoods. Not all homeowners are “rich”. 
May be “house rich” while being “cash poor”. 2009 Demo Calcs never being adjusted 
per Planning Code Section 317 (b) (2) (D) is a problem in the past, present and 
future. Continual problem. Ongoing. Not only in PEGs but in all neighborhoods. 
Katherine Petrin – Upzoning plan, Mayor’s press release 
Tom – Update via mail to reach seniors, changes occurring in the neighborhood
