SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – Given the debate about whether SF has a “housing 
crisis” or “an affordable housing crisis” and the three market rate projects 
Supervisor Mar mentions in the Richmond Review it seems necessary to 
understand how much housing is occupied full time. But in terms of 
occupancy of all the market rate, multi-unit housing built and approved in 
the past decade plus, it would be really good to construct a study of the 
water bills to gauge whether or not all this market rate housing is occupied 
full time. ….with people living in these units, not just that units are bought 
as investments, or a place to stash some cash. Water bills show usage. 
Usage can reveal whether or not there is full time occupancy. Department 
Staff has quantitative skills that could analyze water bills in bulk to 
understand and estimate how much of this housing is lived in full time.
