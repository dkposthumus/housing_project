between the Bernal Heights SUD and Section 317 Tantamount to Demolition is the 
precise reason that Section 317 was created in the first place and approved by the 
Board of Supervisors and signed by the Mayor in 2008. That reason was to allow for 
reasonable Alterations that would not demolish a residential structure. The three 
definitions in Section 317 (b) (2) are equivalent….the same. No difference between a 
full Demolition or an outright Demolition and Tantamount to Demolition. The 
definition on page 5 of the CID is: “Tantamount to a Demolition: the term used to 
describe a project that has exceeded removal thresholds under Section 317 or Section 
1005 of the Planning Code.” Commission needs to assert legislative authority per 
Section 317 (b) (2) (D). Other questions: INTERPRETATIONS OF CODE? LAW OF THE 
DAY? TYPE OF PERMIT APPLICATION?
