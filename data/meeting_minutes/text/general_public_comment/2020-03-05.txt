Georgia Schuttish – Roof Deck Policy on website 
 
 
Roof Deck Policy not found on CPC Website. 
 
 
Official Roof Deck Policy stalled since 2018. 
Roof Deck should be defined as: “open space on the uppermost area of a structure 
requiring a stairpenthouse or a hatch for access”. 
 
Plans conflate this with a “roofdeck” that is off living space, created by setbacks 
that reduce the mass, particularly setbacks overlooking rear yards. These should 
be called “terraces” per Dictionary definition.
