SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – Commission could codify the Flat Policy with objective 
standards that preserve the Flats in their original location and configuration within 
the structure including hallways that define the use and layout of each Flat. The 
Commission could encourage more scrutiny of Alterations or Demolitions to 
preserve UDUs not just currently separately slept in, but if they are a viable, sound, 
livable space that may have been occupied in the past and more importantly could 
be occupied in the future. These three may be most financially feasible housing as 
alluded to in previous reports. RHNA numbers raise questions. Major demographic 
changes in the next decade. 
Tom Radulovich – Be more proactive, public realm
