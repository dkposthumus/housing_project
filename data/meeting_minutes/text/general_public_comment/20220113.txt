SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish - Please watch the entire General Public Comment on 
6/25/2015 on SFGOVTV, where Mr. Sanchez says it is hard to enforce 
Section 317 if projects in photos not caught at right time and that Section 
317 has “problems” AND he agrees that some of the photos of these 
extreme Alterations are “cause for concern”. The problem is that the Demo 
Calcs have never been adjusted since instituted in 2008. In 2009 when the 
Commission approved the first CID, Staff testified that the Calcs would 
need adjusting and Staff would return with recommendations to adjust 
them.…of course that never happened My three-minute comment on 
6/25/2015 is about issues that are ongoing: Extreme Alterations that 
should be classified as Demolitions, including the increase in major 
excavations. These speculative extreme Alterations discussed back in 2015 
are on the updated list sent for 1/13/2022 General Public Comment.
