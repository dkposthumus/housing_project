SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – I sent an email for General Public Comment on the 
morning the 11th about DR with a screenshot of 2017 email correspondence 
with former Director of Current Planning Joslin about the number of DR 
hearings in 2015 to 2016 which shows that DR doesn’t really take up and 
extraordinary and exceptional amount of the Commission’s time compared 
with the importance of DR to the public’s participation in the Planning 
process…a participation which is vital. There are actually what seems like 
a reasonable number of DR’s in a City as complex like San Francisco. I think 
Mr. Sider also has some info on this that may be similar numbers on a yearly 
basis to what Mr. Joslin wrote to me.
