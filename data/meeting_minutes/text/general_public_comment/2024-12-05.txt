Georgia Schuttish – Astoundingly there were no Demo Calcs from Planning for 
project in pdf even though Section 317 Code Implement Document (CID) approved 
and published in 2009 and 2010. Remains astounding that the Commission has 
never used their legislative authority to adjust the Demo Calcs. Permit for 4267 24th 
Street applied in October 2012. Planning staff signed off in April 2013. December 
2012, SF Weekly published article quoting how developers of 125 Crown Terrace 
used Demo Calcs getting around Section 317, getting approval as Alteration for 
project that had been denied approval as Demolition. With recent sale at $6.8 
million, 4267 24th Street is now a comp in real estate terms. Another SFH approved 
as Demo, constructing two units. needed Enforcement. “De facto merged” into 7 
bedroom house asking $8.1 million at same time as SFH in pdf on market for $6.8 
million. Waiting Rezoning Financial Feasibility Studies for over a year.
