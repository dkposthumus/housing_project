SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – In the four years between the 2015-2019, the RET and 
the Peskin Legislation were both proposed and dropped. However, on 
October 12, 2017 the Commission approved the Residential Flat Policy 
which mitigated the loss of housing that was occurring as de facto mergers 
under Section 317 (b) (7). In the two years between 2019 and today, the 
Large Residence Ordinance has been proposed, but excoriated. However, 
in Spring of 2020, the Demonstrably Unaffordable provision in Section 317 
(d) (3) (A) for the RH-1 Districts was removed from the Code by the 
Commission and the Board of Supervisors. All Demolitions of sound 
housing in all RH neighborhoods now need a CUA. The Residential Flat 
Policy and requiring a CUA in all RH-1 neighborhoods are proactive and 
positive reforms to Section 317. Adjusting the Demo Calcs per Section 317 
(b) (2) (D) would also be a proactive, positive reform.
