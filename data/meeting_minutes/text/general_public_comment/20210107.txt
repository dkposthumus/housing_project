SPEAKERS: 
Eric – Advocating for zero code 
Georgia Schuttish - Happy New Year. Please read the email and two 
attachments I sent on Tuesday, January 5, 2021 to the Commission, the 
Director and other Staff. It concerns fixing Section 317, something that it 
seems everyone believes needs fixing since there have been two attempts 
in the past and apparently some attempts ongoing. While I am skeptical 
about any “fixes” reaching fruition, I do want to point out that the 
Demolition Calculations were never adjusted per Section 317 (b) (2) (D) 
while the RH-1 Demonstrably Unaffordable Value was adjusted five times 
since 2009 until the legislation removing Section 317 (d) (3) (A) from the 
Planning Code was passed last year. This is worthy of discussion. I hope the 
Commission and Staff will have a chance to read the email sent on January 
5, 2021. Thank you.
