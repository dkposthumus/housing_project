Georgia Schuttish – The Residential Flat Policy was a good first step in protecting 
this recognized typology of housing per Planning Commission Resolution No. 
20024. However while important, egress and exposure as definitions of what makes 
it a Flat is not enough. Preserving the existing or original location of a Flat within a 
structure is critical. So is the existing or original layout. This layout generally includes 
a hallway that runs through most of a Flat from the front door to the back door. Or 
it may be a foyer near the front door. (.e Tunnel Entrance Flats) This feature is key in 
the layout of Residential Flats. In any plans submitted for renovation of Residential 
Flats, the hallway and/or the foyer must not be permitted to be altered or 
eliminated. Also an entire Flat should not be re-located to the garage/ basement 
level, which offers the opportunity for an ADU.
