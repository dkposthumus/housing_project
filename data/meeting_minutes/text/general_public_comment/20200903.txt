SPEAKERS: 
Speaker – Inability to speak face to face with other people with hearings 
remotely 
Georgia Schuttish – Hope the Commission had opportunity to read emails 
sent on 8/26 and 8/31 regarding two Noe Valley projects and Demo Calcs 
as well as a third email sent on 9/3. The Sanchez/Day project sold for $9.1 
million in July (previous sale $1.167 in June 2015, Site Permit of under $1 
million) is emblematic of all extreme Alterations but particularly and 
especially egregious because the Calcs were so very close to the 
thresholds. It should have been a CUA. The project on Elizabeth is 
unfortunate because it is two currently livable flats that are off the market 
—- unoccupied, empty —- with the entitlement for sale even before the 
Site permit has been issued, plus it’s Calcs are squishy. The Demo Calcs 
should have been adjusted at least once since 2009 —- per Section 317 
(b) (2) (D) —- (and most probably twice) to comply with the intent of 
Section 317.
