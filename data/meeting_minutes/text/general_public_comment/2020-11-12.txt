SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – Extreme Alterations that should have been reviewed as 
Tantamount to Demolition have particular characteristics like maximum vertical 
and horizon expansions along with facade changes or facade obliteration….often 
with invasive roof decks, not necessary for open space requirements. The windows 
change, particularly on the rear facade with walls of glass having an impact on the 
rear yard mid-block open space. Also these projects have full lot excavations which 
eliminate carbon capturing and tree canopy. This exterior design translates into 
the interior design with an inefficient use of space with kitchens overwhelming 
the main living level. No hallways, no light wells, no discrete rooms for living. 
Bedroom number becomes extra square footage for sale. This is housing that does 
not comply with the intentions of Section 317 to preserve existing housing and 
relative affordability and is contrary to the City’s housing policies and is 
questionable in the age of COVID.
