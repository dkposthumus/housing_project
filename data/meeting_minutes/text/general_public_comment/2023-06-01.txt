SPEAKERS: 
Eileen Boken – Survey results, housing element 
 
 
Corey Smith – Housing Element, planning process 
Georgia Schuttish – Unlike the info on the Sanchez Street project sent for 
the May 25th General Public Comment, a project that should have been 
demolished, not approved as an alteration creating a Monster Home, the 
info on the Chavez Street project sent for today’s General Public Comment 
was about a sound building that could have been preserved and densified 
without being demolished. It had a tradesman’s entranced which could 
have allowed for a second unit on the garage level. There is a huge 
amount of existing, sound housing like this…some which already may 
have a UDU…with egress that would allow a livable, viable second unit. 
Both projects had screwy, illogical demo Calcs. As I wrote in the emails 
both projects are on the market again. There are many opportunities to 
add a unit, to increase density in existing, should housing without 
Demolition. And adjusting the Demo Calcs could incentivize that.
