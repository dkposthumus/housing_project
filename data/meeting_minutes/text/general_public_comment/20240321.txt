SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – Priority Equity Geography neighborhoods: Policies under 
Housing Element and Constraints Reduction Ordinance call for preservation of 
existing housing. Current Calcs facilitate speculation/demolition. Ordinances 
creating SUDs cites increase in median sales price of “more than tripling from 2011 
to 2021….this includes a 9% increase from 2019 to 2020 alone”. Noe Valley projects 
mirror this. There has certainly been an “under-performance” of housing built for 
middle income families and families in lower AMIs. However speculation has been 
glossed over by the Ordinances. The Demo Calcs never being adjusted since 2009 as 
intended by Section 317 Findings is a piece of the puzzle that has allowed 
speculation/demolition to flourish. The Commission’s power has been yanked away 
by Sacramento. The Demo Calcs should be adjusted as the Commission has the 
Legislative Authority to do in order to protect housing for families in the PEGs, 
dampen speculation, preventing Alterations from becoming Demolitions.
