SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – Per Findings in Constraints Reduction at 2 (g), Housing Element 
seeks to protect PEGs from “zoning changes and planning processes” that could 
have “adverse racial and social equity impacts”. Section 317 values defining 
Demolition also have “planning process” goal to prevent an Alteration from being 
a Demolition. Tehlirian v. The City and County of SF is a Court of Appeal decision 
agreeing with City’s determination of the project as a “de facto Demolition”. Case 
was prior to Section 317 implementation but description of the project as a 
horizontal/vertical expansion with removal of front facade is precisely the same 
scope of work that is a “permitted process” under current threshold values of the 
Demo Calcs. And this is why Calcs should be adjusted as the Commission has the 
legislative authority to do under Section 317 (b) (2) (D). Facts of case remain relevant 
today as stated during General Public Comment.
