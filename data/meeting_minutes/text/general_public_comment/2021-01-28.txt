Georgia Schuttish â€“ In the email sent to the Commission on Tuesday (1/26) 
the two projects shown are just like so many others since Section 317 was 
implemented. The Calcs need to be adjusted because the outcomes of 
these Alterations are not what was intended when Section 317 was added 
to the Planning Code back in 2008. See the Findings at Sec 317 (a) Please 
read the Tuesday (1/26) email. What can be taken away from looking at the 
photos and reading their Revised Demo Calcs? These projects are not 
considered Demolitions, or Tantamount to Demolition or de facto 
Demolitions, because even with the Revised Demo Calcs, reviewed by the 
extremely competent Enforcement Staff, they do not cross the threshold as 
Demolitions per Section 317 (b) (2) (B) and (b) (2) (C). Therefore, the Demo 
Calcs should be adjusted per Section 317 (b) (2) (D).
