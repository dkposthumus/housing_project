and Staff on 9/11. This should have been reviewed as a Demolition both prior to and after the 
Enforcement. It should have had a CUA. It was A rated historic house. During Enforcement 
developers manipulated design putting Horizontal value at 50%. They redesigned project when 
caught. The Vertical is way over threshold. The Calcs should be adjusted as the Commission has the 
legislative authority to do under Section 317 (b) (2) (D). Year two values shown on the screen are 
the threshold that would preserve housing. If the house on Raycliff could be demolished using the 
loophole of the existing Demo Calcs, how can the sound housing in the Priority Equity 
neighborhoods be protected as promised in the Housing Element.
