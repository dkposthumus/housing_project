Georgia Schuttish - Three projects shown in email sent June 15, 2021 to the

Alterations. These are the type of projects that Section 317 TTD was devised 
to prevent. Approved as Alterations, veering into Demolitions, avoiding the 
DBI Demolition definition, because Section 317 Thresholds are not 
stringent enough. This is a loophole. This has led to an acceleration in 
housing prices. RH District speculation is rampant past 10+ years. 
Preservation of housing is important because existing housing has been 
found to be more “financially accessible” (relatively affordable) per Section 
317 Planning Code Findings. Please adjust Demo Calcs per Section 317 (b) 
(2) (D) to comply with Findings.
