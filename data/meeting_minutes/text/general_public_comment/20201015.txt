Georgia Schuttish – Two sets of photos I emailed to the Commission Monday 
10/12 - one from 2015 and one from 2020 shows why Section 317 (b) (2) (B) and 
(b) (2) (C) which are the Demo Calcs should be adjusted by the Commission per 
Section 317 (b) (2) (D). The intent of the three subsections of 317 is not to have 
more hearings - but to preserve housing - to allow reasonable alterations or 
expansions - a bedroom or two or a larger kitchen with a deck - and not be a Demo 
or Tantamount or Defacto Demo. The way to preserve housing is to preserve 
it……the rationale for the Commission’s ability to adjust the Demo Calcs is to 
make the Demo Calcs more effective under Section 317- As originally proposed in 
2007, the Calcs were more stringent than currently….the ability to adjust the 
Calcs allowed the Commission to do “a fix” as needed.
