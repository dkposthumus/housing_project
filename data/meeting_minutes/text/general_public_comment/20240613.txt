in the potential Haight-Ashbury Historic District. Three rent controlled units have been 
lost. Entire building selling for $10.5 million. Or selling for multi-millions as individual 
units even though there has been no condo splitting up per the Assessor’s Info. This 
project took advantage of the Demo Calcs. Even before receiving the “blessing” to

since 2009 per Planning Code Section 317 (b) (2) (D) to fulfill the intent of Section 317 
to preserve existing, sound housing for the people of San Francisco now and in the 
future.
