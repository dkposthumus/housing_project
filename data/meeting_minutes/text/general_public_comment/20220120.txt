Georgia Schuttish – Work on project started in 2015 and continues till today 
with the current version of the project as seen in photo with email. Project 
is example of why the Staff has called Noe Valley “an epicenter of de facto 
Demolition”. And why the Demolition Calculations need to be adjusted as 
Staff said in 2009 they might recommend within the following year. The 
main point of the email is the three sets of Demo Calcs which are attached 
for this one Noe Valley project. Demo Calcs which were done by three 
different professionals in 2015; 2017 and 2019. Project increased in 
size/scope under different permits. Permit/Sales History illustrates problem 
with never adjusting the TTD thresholds for Demo Calcs as the Commission 
is empowered to do per Section 317 (b) (2) (D) as way to preserve housing 
and relative affordability.
