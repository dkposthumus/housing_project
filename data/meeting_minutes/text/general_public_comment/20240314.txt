SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – Project had permit issued October 2017. CFC issued March 
2021. Revision needed September 2019 to correct Demo Calcs which did not 
account for removal of roof. Calcs originally approved without removal of roof for 
two story vertical expansion. Removal of roof was 100% raising Horizontal Calc to 
81% from 50.4%. Vertical listed at 20%. Photos show transformation. Dramatic 
escalation in price from 2015 which was peak year in the original sales price of these 
speculative projects that turned into extreme Alterations and made Noe Valley the 
“epicenter of de facto Demolition” per the Staff. Sold several months after CFC for 
$7.6 million in September 2021. Returned to market at $9 million recently. Listing 
since removed. Similar high end, extreme Alterations for sale/sold recently or 
removed from market. Instability/speculation in housing: Issue for PEGs. Demo 
Calcs should be adjusted to protect/preserve housing in this SUD per Housing 
Element.
