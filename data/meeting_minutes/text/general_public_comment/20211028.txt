environment of rear yards that cumulatively create: Rear Yard Mid Block 
Open Space. Obliterating natural rear yards with excavations that expand a 
house underneath the existing house, spreading out into the remainder of 
the lot, beyond the 45% line and beyond to all the lot lines of the adjacent 
properties, causes the loss of the natural rear yard, replaced by huge 
cement retaining walls and so-called patios that are just more cement with 
a drain and a sump pump. RH projects creating major excavations create 
major amounts of pollution. Loss of rear yards means loss of ability to 
capture carbon. Please continue having these discussions on the rear yard 
mid block open space for projects whether legal Demolitions or extreme 
Alterations. And please ask the Staff to consider this as well.
