Georgia Schuttish – Fiscal 2015-2016 over 10,000 permits. 45 were DR’ed. 45 is 
minuscule. Only 34 were Public DRs for housing. All DRs for housing were approved 
by Commission. There were 4 Mandatory DRs for housing, one for multi-unit 
building of 7 units that was never built Perception that the City is drowning in 
Requests for DR. There has never been a DR claiming an Alteration was really a 
Demolition. That is one reason the Demo Calcs should be adjusted. Some of the 
projects on this list that applied as Alterations were likely Demolitions. There were 
no published Demo Calcs on SFPIM. Includes deFacto unit merger. Several were 
spec projects that sold for $4.2 million; $4.4 million; $5.7 million; and even $9.8 
million. Light, air, privacy and rear yard mid-block open space are often concerns 
that Commissioners representing officials elected by voters need to rule on using 
their Discretionary power.
