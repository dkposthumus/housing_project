C.COMMISSIONERS’ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
6.         Commission Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements.  Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Moore:
I would like to congratulate the Planning Department for receiving this special achievement award regarding the Pavement to Parks Project. It is a wonderful achievement, and I would like to include the citizens of San Francisco in winning this award. It is not just policy, but it is really the attitude about how the City is embracing this. It is a very forward-looking idea.
Commissioner Antonini:
I have had meetings and conversations for requests on the calendar for 2507 Larkin Street. I just wanted to mention that. Congratulations to the City and the Bayview Hunters Point Shipyard for the funding that was obtained. The Mayor just had a press conference for that moments ago.
Commissioner Miguel:
I was just at that press conference. The lead developer at Hunters Point, Candlestick Point Compound received a check for the foundation to disperse the public funds. Regarding that dispersal, $7.2 million goes a long way in this regard. The entire community there was very appreciative of this coming through. This is something that is not happening in the rest of the country. I talked to Planning Commissioners in various areas in California as well as other areas around the country. They are having a very hard time with things. They're not in the more optimistic anticipatory mode that San Francisco developers and officials are. We are in a very rare position here. We should take time to appreciate it.
Commissioner Sugaya:
Last Saturday I had the privilege of being part of a program sponsored by the BART. It was a celebration of 60 years of the Japanese-American Evacuation. The San Bruno BART station is on the site of the racetrack, which was used as an assembly area for the people in the East Bay and San Francisco, where they were first assembled before they were sent to the internment camps further inland. Most of the evacuees went to Topaz, where I was born. The exhibit was of Dorothea Lange photographs that she took at the center. Jackie Spear was a speaker, and stayed, surprisingly, for about an hour and a half, with representatives from San Bruno, Foster City, San Francisco, and others. Representative Mike Honda and Nancy Pelosi also had representatives there. It was a really great event. The exhibit is open if you are ever traveling on BART and want to go to the San Bruno Station, it is up for the month of May, which is the Asian Pacific Islander American -- whatever it is called -- heritage month. It will be up for the entire month of May in the station. The organizers are hoping that we will be able to get BART to put a permanent memorial there.
Commissioner Moore:
I want to acknowledge commissioner Sugaya for what he just shared with us. My understanding is that this exhibit was to be in the San Francisco Library. Is that incorrect?
Commissioner Sugaya:
There is a separate exhibit at the San Francisco main library through June 24th. It is slightly different. There are about 30 to 40 pieces of art that were created by internees while they were at the Topaz Internment Camp. It is on the fourth floor and is free. During the month of May and June, the library is sponsoring a number of evening lectures and events.
Commissioner Moore:
The other thing I wanted to share with the Commission is that the Mayor in doing the signing ceremony for the America's Cup and he thanked this Commission for its support. . It is up and running, although we have not seen the final version of America's Cup.
7.         Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
I wanted to thank the Commission for the NIA award.  And related to that, I was part of a group including Supervisor Avalos that cut the ribbon for the 27thparklet, which is in the Excelsior District. This was actually built by a group of students, designed and built by a group of students through an organization called The Out of Sight Youth Center in the Excelsior. The students were all there and very proud of it. There are 27 parklets and there are about 40 more in the pipeline. It is really exciting.  Also, in terms of awards, I do not think I got to mention that at the conference in L.A. Last month, the Department received a National Award for the hard-won victory category. It was nice to get that recognition in a room of about 3000 people during the awards ceremony. It was gratifying.
8.Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
LAND USE COMMITTEE:
§120300 and 120301 Articles 10 & 11.Introduced by Supervisor Scott Wiener, on Monday April 30 and co-sponsored by Supervisor Olague.  The HPC provided review and comment on the proposed amendments on February 1, of this year.  This Commission provided review and comment on February 2 of this year.  Overall, the HPC and PC held 25 hearings on this proposal.  After opening remarks by both Director Rahaim and Supervisor Wiener Planning Staff summarized the amendments and the comments of both commissions.  The amended Ordinance was based on the version sent to the Board by the Planning Commission and was largely aligned with the HPC's recommendation.  The only changes since the PC review was to Affordable housing.  This Commission had asked the Supervisor to work with Planning Staff to clarify what projects would qualify and what criteria is used to review those projects. The Mayor’s Office on Housing spoke in support of the amendments to ensure compliance with our Certified Local Government agreement.  After lengthy public comment, the Ordinance and related Amendments were forwarded with a positive recommendation to the Full Board.  A modification was added at the hearing that would require the BOS to consider the views of occupants as well as owners when taking action on proposed historic districts. Sup. Cohen and Wiener voted in support to the Full Board.  Mar stated he was supportive of the amendments but voted no on the recommendation of approval.  He said that given from public testimony that more discussion should take place with the preservation community. The legislation is slated for a vote by the full BOS on Tuesday, May 8.
This week the Committee forwarded the Ordinance with a recommendation of approval.

HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:
There were a couple of items yesterday at the Preservation Commission that I would like to share with you. The Planning staff provided an overview of the Department's TDR Program based on the recommendations in the Transit District Plan.  It recommended reclassification of 43 properties to the Article 11 Code, and the expansion of the New Montgomery St. Conservation District. This will include 26 additional properties. Finally, the HPC added four properties to its program. These actions were to initiate the process, and the Department will present to the Planning Commission and to the agency next month before sending them to the full Board of Supervisors for consideration. I believe what will be presented to you today as an overview of the district plan and some of that information will be included in the presentation to you. The HPC also adopted a survey and context statement for the Oceanside Neighborhood in the Sunset. This neighborhood was sponsored by San Francisco Beautiful and the Historic Preservation Fund Committee. The general boundaries of the area were broadened to include the edge of Golden Gate Park, 37th Avenue, 45th Avenue, and Pacific Avenue. There was a focus on only the earliest properties found primarily from the turn of the century. After a large amount of public testimony, the HPC voted to adopt the context statement to be forwarded to the State Preservation Commission.
