C.COMMISSIONERSâ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
11.        
Commission Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements.  
Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or 
inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.  
At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a 
Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda 
of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Moore:
I would like to share an event regarding the Chinatown Development Corporation 
last Friday.  A group of 12 young, enthusiastic interns took eight weeks and 
divided into three teams to analyze the problems of Chinatown.  It was a 
remarkably insightful analysis and interesting set of recommendations that came 
from students raging from the age of just graduating from high school to a 
genius and seniors already enrolled in college.  It was a wonderful event.  The 
Planning Department attended in addition to Supervisor Kim and people from 
Supervisor Chu's office.  I do hope the Planning Department engages strongly to 
teach young people about urban activism, planning, and design matters.  I was 
very impressed.  The students themselves are off to various destinations.  I 
encourage Gloria Flores to keep the record of these findings as part of the base 
data for when this Department moves into looking at Chinatown.Commissioner Miguel:
During the week, I have met with the Jewish Home regarding their Institutional 
Master Plan that is in the process at the moment as well as with representatives 
of the California Nurses Association.

conducting a second workshop on the Chinatown - Broadway Street Design Project. 
That will take place on Thursday, August 16, from 4:30 until 7:00 at the 
Elementary School at 950 Clay Street. They will present several plans for 
Chinatown, at the Gordon Lau Elementary School.
13.Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of 
Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
LAND USE COMMITTEE:  cancelled this 
week
FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
§110592 Inner, Outer Clement and Geary NC Controls.Commissioners, 
you heard this item sponsored by Supervisor Mar on July 14, at that time you 
recommended approval with modifications.  Supervisor Mar amended the Ordinance 
to include your recommendations, except for one.  First you recommended permit 
one additional restaurant in the Inner Clement and then allow additional 
restaurants in both the Inner and Outer Clement by CU.  The Supervisor 
accommodated this request as it still is a relaxation from the existing 
controls. Second, you recommended to remove the prohibition on Formula Retail 
Pet Supply Stores. Although Supervisor Mar did not remove this prohibition, 
there was discussion of this at both the Committee and the Board.This week 
the Board approved Supervisor Marâs Ordinance on FINAL reading[1].
§Limited Live Performance.Commissioners, you heard this item sponsored by Supervisor Mirkarimi on July 7.  
This Ordinance would to create a Limited Live Performance Permit for indoor 
locales whose primary function is not presentation of live performances.  At 
that time, you recommended approval with modifications. You requested that the 
Ordinance be amended to extend the opportunity for small-scale entertainment to 
be considered an accessory use in the SOMA, West Portal, and Pacific Avenue 
districts.  At the Land Use hearing Supervisor Mirkarimi incorporated all of 
your modifications, except one.  On the request of Supervisor Kim, he has 
amended the Ordinance so that it allows this entertainment use in the SoMa 
Districtsâbut only in the areasnotinvolved in the Western SoMa 
Community Planning Process.  The ordinance would initially limit performances to 
10pm, however, after 1 year a Limited Live Entertainment Permittees may ask the 
Director of the Entertainment Commission to extend the hours of performance.  
This week at the Full Board hearing, Board President Chiu and Supervisor Farrell 
introduced amendments for their districts that would not permit an extension in 
hours beyond 10pm for the Union Street, Chestnut, North Beach and Polk St 
Commercial Districts.  Supervisor Farrell also added a noticing provision where 
interested parties could âopt-inâ and request notice about LLE permits.With 
these amendments, the Full Board passed the Ordinance on first reading.
§Board Approved a Resolution Establishing their own response to the Parkmerced 
Civil Grand Jury.The Board 
disagreed with the Civil Grand Juryâs Findings No 1-5 and incorporated the 
Office of Economic and Workforce Developmentâs responses as their own.This 
Resolution was adopted 6-5.[2]
§1945 Hyde StreetCat Ex Appeal-Commissioners, on June 16, you heard a Discretionary Review on the related 
project. The project would convert a parking garage into a three-story over 
basement, 7-unit residential building, with 17 parking spaces on stackers and a 
small commercial space along Hyde Street. At the DR hearing, you modified the 
project and included additional setbacks.  The Russian Hill Community 
Association appealed the Cat EX stating that the project would have a range of 
significant impacts that were not identified in the exemption.  However, the 
appellant did not specify aspects of the exemption that they considered 
inadequateâinstead they asked that the Department respond to 70+ pages of 
comments submitted during the Cat Ex review.  The comment letters that are cited 
in the appeal made a variety of points about the character of the site and 
surroundings; historic resources, transportation; existing plans and policies, 
noise, and aesthetics. Given the upcoming Recess and the requirements for 
holding a prompt hearing, the Department had to prepare a lengthy response in 
short order.  The Departmentâs quickly prepared thorough response of 70+ pages 
explained how the exemption adequately addressed each topic, an effort that took 
over $10k to prepare.  With this additional material, we again concluded that 
the project qualifies for an exemption under Section 15332 of the CEQA 
Guidelines and has no significant impacts.At the appeal hearing this week, 
the appellant and their supporters failed to appear and provided the board with 
a letter stating there continued objection to the project.  After short 
presentations from the Department and the project sponsor, the Board upheld the 
Cat Ex 11-0.
Board of Appeals:
No Report Given
HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:
The Historic Preservation Commission did meet yesterday. The two items of note 
were the Draft Environmental Impact Reports for the America's Cup and San 
Francisco MOMA. The Commission decided not to draft a letter for SFMOMA. There 
was only one real concern and staff made note of it to forward to the 
Environmental Review Officer. For the America's Cup, there was also no public 
testimony.  However, the Commission decided to continue the item and leave it 
open for their consideration at the next hearing.  Although there might not be 
any concerns at that hearing, they wanted the opportunity to take more time to 
study the document.
