Commissioner Moore:
I wanted to express my 
appreciation for a different way of organizing this presentation. The fact that 
you really are laying out the basic elements of how the department of works is 
helpful to me and I also appreciate the zoning administration becomes more 
clearly delineated for us and I am sure in your communication with the public it 
will be significantly easier to understand what that entails. So I made several 
question marks during the course of the presentation that we cannot take in 
everything, I would like to ask the Director, is there a time and it might not 
be today, where we would get an overview of the nature of plans, and how they 
were originated and what the product are which are expected when obviously they 
are not just additional ways to deliver something? I'm kind of curious how you 
are threading that into your programs and a very innovative way of getting 
grants and I would love to hear what we can expect as the next side benefit out 
of keeping the department at full strength and also seeing creative work which 
May not occur.
Planning Director:
We have a spread sheet 
that outlines the grants that we have received and that can be updated. Why 
don't we plan to attach that to the next memo as well.  Most of the grants, not 
all of them, but urban design and public works on the projects and we can go 
over that with you.
Commissioner Moore: 
 Thank you, director. That would be very helpful. My second point is directed 
towards to  Mr. Alubaugh, is there any room and you are commanding a reasonably 
large number of people, to see the city design that we are spending a little bit 
more time on residential design guidelines? I think the nature of some of the 
curiosity that we really need to expand and elevate the discussion on the design 
guidelines might find very good place in your department under this particular 
item. I am proposing to express that to see the department take on a 
neighborhood, to be determined, and perhaps through a hybrid form base of code 
set up guidelines by which we test new ways of helping particularly strong 
neighborhoods to be more clear about changes can and shouldn't be and help with 
streamlining that process, I don't know, but I would like to see some 
experimentation in that direction.
David Alumbaugh:
Before I answer that one, 
I wanted to point out that the mission streetscape plan you see today is funded 
by the State and that is an example of some of the products we get from our 
grant and some of the exciting work we're doing. In terms of the questions you 
have asked, there are two. One the design guidelines and residential guidelines 
in particular and the Department as part of the reorganization has or the of 
solidified this design review process, and we are depending on those person who 
is help us with all kinds of guidelines including residential guidelines as an 
important portion of that work and you will see that included in the city wide 
section. It certainly is work that happens throughout all the Department and as 
well in terms of creative thought for certain neighborhoods, that was the idea 
behind what we are calling the better neighborhoods, and the existing 
neighborhoods program is really going out to some neighborhoods to see if 
there's some things we can do to make things work better for folks. I don't 
think we know how that will be articulated. It will further come about as we 
start this discussion, but certainly that is one of the interests that we have 
as well.
Commissioner Moore: 
 I appreciate your explaining that to us, next one is Mr. Wycko and item 2b and 
negative declarations and is the E.I.R. Under that item or is that fully funded?Planning Director:
As I said, we have about a 
quarter million dollars of actual money that comes for general fund money and 
things that don't have dedicated funds. That is roughly 2.4 of that item and the 
other 4 F.T.E.Commissioner Moore:
That doesn't get you far 
if I remember the cost of the E.I.R., is that correct? $450,000 doesn't get you 
very far.
Planning Director:
This is staff time, not 
counting -- this is over and above all that. We show in our budget the stafftime, not showing the consultant time. We are not the only city department that 
has those costs and we are showing it currently as an unfunded project not 
because we don't think it will be funded but because we currently don't know the 
funding source but there is a whole program for the city to raise funds through 
the private sector to fund the city's costs. The E.I.R. Consultants will be 
provided by the core budget and we don't have to show the consultant for the 
E.I.R. In the budget.
Commissioner Moore: 
  I'm not trying to put you on the spot. i just wanted to understand how you 
line that item and this is item three that you answered is communications and 
who communicates, who is it, and about what?
Planning Director:
This was an item that was 
approved in last year's budget and we have not yet been able to fill this 
position. But the idea was that the Department, we felt, and I have felt 
particularly strongly that the Department needs a Communications Manager that 
covers a whole series of activities including conduct public meetings, the 
website, how we have connection with the media, all those various functions that 
come under the rubric of communication and we have never had an information 
officer and we have never had that in the Department. I think it's long overdue 
and I think there's inconsistent messages that go from the Department that is 
very important for us to correct.
Commissioner Moore:
I think. I appreciate all 
answers by everybody.
Commissioner  Borden:
I have a few questions and 
we are told we're adding money back for -- we're not going to be able to do 
that?, it looks like we're not getting the money for japan town?
Planning Director:
Commissioner, you are 
talking about the chart on the front page?
Commissioner Borden: 
  correct.
Planning Director:
Japantown 50 grand was an 
add back and that is well on time and that will be stripped out of our budget. I 
show that as coming out both on the revenue and on the expenditure side.
Commissioner Borden:
I wasn't aware, did we 
work on Japantown? I wasn't aware -- we hadn't heard about that in a while. I 
guess I wasn't aware of that. I had a question, and we talked about this planner 
technician, but I am not sure what that is, so maybe you could tell me how 
that's different â the Planner Technician is something that was kind of 
conceived by the Support Staff, by the Administrative staff of the Department to 
reflect that many of them do work beyond the normal administrative functions and 
promote the opportunity for the administrative staff. So it's both between the 
position that is between administrative staff and a planner I. and it 
essentially some of what will happen -- it has little budget impact because the 
administrative staff will be converted into that position.
Commissioner Borden: 
  and I was really interested in hearing about the better neighborhoods program 
strengthening the existing neighborhoods program. When is that -- when do we 
think we're going to be doing workshops on that? The better neighborhoods 
program strengthening neighborhoods in community discussions in established 
neighborhoods. Can you talk about the timeline for that and what you kind of 
envision?
Planning Director:
I can. I also maybe as 
they responded to the earlier part of the question, but in the workprogram they do staff the Japantown effort. So I don't know who was around when 
we started the better neighborhoods planning process some years ago, but the 
real purpose of that is to go out and both to listen to communities and talk to 
communities about what it is that makes themthrive as neighborhoods. And there are elements, eight elements of a great 
neighborhood and all that.We just thought we would, having done a lot of planning and a lot of serious 
growth dialogue inseveral areas of the City, we have other areas functioning and could function 
more strongly and better neighborhood commercial districts and all that And we 
have no preconceived notion of what we try to do there and can be a dialogue to 
ask them what's working and not working and what they would like to see us do 
that we can have in the bag of tools. we would start that if it stays in the 
budget, we'll start if t fiscal year and probably come to you once we have a few 
discussions with the community about what that might mean and present it to you 
and go from there.
Commissioner Borden: 
  would you select specific neighborhoods or public input determine the 
established neighborhoods we would focus on?
Planning Director:
I don't think we know how 
we'll find out does anybody want to do the first place, but have that dialogue 
and are there folks that would like that kind of dialogue with planning 
department.Commissioner Borden:
My next question is about 
the level of service impact analysis and I know you have mentioned we're getting 
closer. I wanted to find out where we were with that analysis.
Planning Director:
The task force set up with 
other agencies and consultants that were hired that worked lastyear and are now starting at the second date. It culminated in the development 
fee and set the plate for that level of service, but I think there's some 
misdirection going around that I think we have learned differently after this 
year and the expectation is that  the work is starting now will culminate in a 
recommendation by the summer and there would be an ordinance that would 
basically, the concept, not the specifics, because the specifics still need to 
be worked out, that there would be a fee and whereby you would pay into a fund 
for transportation improvements that would offset affects of development and 
that would serve as a fully mitigated substitute for the level of service 
analysis. That's the concept. and subsequent to the ordinance, there would be 
environment reviews, so not this calendar year for the change that puts 
everything in place so there is really not just we're going to get doing it, but 
a legally defensible avenue to deal with the impacts.
Commissioner Borden:
Maybe when it gets closer 
to the time of having hearings on it and I know a lot of people in the public 
have been worried about where we are. So another hearing at another time maybe 
closer to the time where there are recommendations would be great.
Planning Director:
I would think that 
probably would be sometime this summer.
Commissioner Olague: 
  A quick question for staff that has to do with the cultural survey. Just 
wondering and I guess it could be the Historic Preservation Commission that 
would be looking at that and a lot of question about cultural surveys and 
Japantown and Manila and that area.
Planning Director:
The E.I.R. Process is 
still well underway and those -- the question about the nature of the survey and 
what is the coastal resource survey.
Commissioner Olague: 
That work program it belongs in there and we are distinguishing between it and 
the historic, pure traditional work that goes on.
Commissioner Olague: 
  There is something obviously allocated to that.
Commissioner Antonini:
This has to do with 
Citywide Planning and one of the things mentioned was the Cesar Chavez 
improvements east and I assume that this is done with coordination between the 
State because that interchange happened to take it going northbound off Cesar 
Chavez and I am assuming sometime in the future they plan to make that a clover 
leaf and I would expect they're going to do our beautification in keeping with 
the future changes that ay be taking place with that roadway which is probably 
going to be changed a lot especially with developments occurring to the east of 
there.
Commissioner Moore: 
  Director, I have one quick question and you can tell me we can talk about this 
some other time. The functional organizational chart which was in our packet 
here here, does that talk about work flow and communication?
Planning Director:
It really is just a chart 
to show reporting structure and how the Department is organized relative to 
reporting. For example, that I report to the Commission and then who reports to 
me and so on.That is really all it's suppose to show. A very broad organizational structure, 
not really about work load.Commissioner Moore:  The work flow communications chart, I am concerned 
about the Historic Preservation Commission and the dashed line and how we 
communicate with them or not and you are saying it is not really.
Planning Director:
The question is not very 
clear. The reason for the dash line is because I technically report to this 
Commission, technically you are my boss and not the HPC, and that is the dashed 
line other than the solid line. That is the only reason for that.
Commissioner moore: 
  We will bring that up in some other discussion.

9.         Review 
of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and 
Historic Preservation Commission.
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
No 
meeting
BOARD OF APPEALS:
The Board of Appeals did meet and there are three items that the Commission 
might be interested. The first was Election of Officers. The Vice President was 
elevated to the office of President and Commissioner Michael Garcia was elevated 
to the position of Vice President and they wish them well in their new position. 
The second item was a rehearing request for 10 Lyndall Lane. It was the subject 
of a .CEQA appeal to Board of Supervisors last week and that was unanimously 
upheld and the determination was unanimously upheld. Last night the Board voted 
5-0 to not grant the rehearing request and that decision is now final. The final 
item of notice of violation of penalty for 468 Green Street. This is a business 
and service office which began operating in 1991. There were no complaints 
received until 2007 when therewas also a permit application of the same building for a workshop called Honey 
Do and that was for this Commission and this Commission approved it as a 
conditional use. Just to note that they did go out of business eight months 
after it opened.And so this came to our attention at that time. They filed the conditional use 
application to legalize the use that was subsequently in legislation that was 
adopted in 2008 and that use was prohibited on the ground floor and they were 
not able to pursue the C.E.U. to legalize the continued enforcement and last 
year the Zoning Administrator hearing to hear their argument, we upheld the 
notice of a violation and appealed to the Board of Appeals. The Board of Appeals 
considered all the facts, including relatively new information about how they 
operate, and their management firm for the building it. And they had agreed they 
would not manage any other properties   and only manage that building and the 
Board found that that would be considered as an accessory use and therefore 
allowed, so they will be allowed to maintain an operation there. However, the 
business and professional service office could not go in there in the future 
because they are acting as an accessory use in managing the functions of the 
building itself. And there was testimony from tenants of the building expressing 
their support for the business there. So the board will adopt findings on that 
matter for a later date. And that is all.
HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:
No report
