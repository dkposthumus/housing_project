Commissioner Moore:
There is an article which I read regarding the utility boxes, which will now be installed because the lawsuit failed. I would like to ask the Director to give us an update on how we will be dealing with 700 new utility cabinets - each six feet wide, four feet tall, two-feet deep - which will be installed without any of the additional utility boxes being removed. There is an expectation they will be installed in a manner that will allow vehicle doors to open on narrow sidewalks in many areas. I consider that an issue, also a big challenge to our [magistrate's] plan. I'm interested in seeing and knowing where these particular utility boxes will be installed.  I'm concerned because the Department has provided comment and push-back relative to these boxes being permitted. Also I would like to get guidance as to whether or not these boxes will basically not require further rooftop installations of micro-antennas. I would like to get a technical update, as well as urban planning and design update of where we are moving with this.
Commissioner Antonini:
A few items: last Thursday I took part in a meeting with Mickey Callahan, Head of the Department of Human Resources, along with Diane Matsuda from the Historic Preservation Commission and Ted Yamasaki and Secretary, Linda Avery. It was a very good meeting. Basically we discussed the issues surrounding classification that will be published in the secretary's job announcement for a new secretary. It was a very good meeting. It was very informative. We were told by DHR that they would get back to us by the end of this week, I think the 7th of September, with suggestions as to this issue. So I'm happy that's moving forward. Couple of other things: regretfully I have had a number of calls from a number of people that's received bogus e-mails [from me]. I've been hacked. I'm not trying to sell a big return on real estate investments to anyone. If you happen to get one of those, please ignore it. Also I'm working with my provider to see what sort of things can be done to remedy that situation. It is, you know, very disturbing. Finally, I thought we received a very excellent memo from Sarah Dennis-Phillips. The Regional Housing Needs Allotments and new ones proposed for the years 2014 and 2022 for San Francisco actually because of the AB2853, which has been with us since 1980, and deals with the subject. Now with AB375 that advocates for housing near transit and near businesses, we have allotments that are fairly high in terms of the entire Bay Area. Allotments for housing were 15%, which is higher than our percentages relative to the entire Bay Area. That is fine; it makes a lot of sense. Also, one of their policies is jurisdictions that are providing, you know, a considerable amount of affordable housing sometimes have percentages lowered for that, and areas that don't, to try to provide an equal mix throughout the region have had theirs raised. So it is -- while there is a long ways to go, it shows we are doing some things right in regards to what we are doing on housing. We still have a long ways to go. It is very enlightening to see these. I really think this was a very informative report. One of the best reports we've gotten.
Commissioner Sugaya:
I had a couple of meeting with the Japantown Neighborhood Planning process. I think it would be good if the Director could get with staff and perhaps schedule an update status report on that process. My understanding is there is a new report by City Hall with respect to ideas regarding the Social Heritage District; so it might be timely just to have an update for the Commission.
8.         Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Welcome back from a much-deserved break. I just want to update you on a couple things, First what was in your written report today: we just wanted to highlight that our property information map did win a government achievement award. I will say that map (the department) gets many, many comments on the convenience of that map and the use of that map. We get over 1,500 unique visits a day on that map, which is a very high number for a web site of that type. We are very pleased. It's become clear it's made the Department's work more efficient and allowed people to get information online that they used to come to the counter for. It is quite a great tool for us.
The promenade, as you are aware, won a design award from architects from Oakland's Walter Hood Design Studio. That is the two blocks of Powell Street between Geary and Ellis. It was essentially a large series of parklets. We are pleased the Department initiated that with the studio with a grant from AUDI Car Company.
Lastly, I wanted to reinforce what Commissioner Antonini was mentioning about the RENA allocation (Regional Housing Needs Allocation). This is a process that of course goes on every few years. I think the region is doing better at coordinating this process, which is a shorter term than the longer term AB375 process - the Sustainable Community Strategy process. That bill requires us to do a 30-year plan. The RENA allocation is I think 8.8 years. It is an odd number. The idea is regional agencies are doing better at coordinating those two things. The first time we did RENA after AB375 was passed, they were not well-coordinated. It is getting better. It is shifting, as you know, some of the preferred growth to larger cities where it transfers to the most served. It is better allocated and coordinated than in the past. There's still work to be done on that, however. It does front-load some of the growth, the 30-year growth. It does front-load some of that growth in this allocation. The number is still relatively high, over 3,000 units a year in San Francisco, which is beyond what we've been able to produce in the past, but is something that I think reflects the demand I think in the region for new housing. We are proposing a hearing on the whole package, including the SCS, so we will get you more details in the coming weeks.
9.         Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
LAND USE COMMITTEE: None
FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
§Chinese Hospital.Committee heard two Ordinances related to the demolition of the existing Chinese Hospital and a project that would rebuild the Medical Office Building, as a 110 ‘ facility with 54 acute-care beds, and a 22-skilled beds.   The Commission recommended approval of these Ordinances on July 12.This week the Board approved the Ordinances on first reading.
In both cases the appellants had withdrawn their appeals prior to the hearing and the items were closed, leaving the CEQA determinations in place.
INTRODUCTIONS:
HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:
The HPC met yesterday and had a very short agenda, so my comments to you will also be very brief. The HPC met in less than an hour to review and approve three certificates of appropriateness for Jackson Square, Alamo and Liberty Hill. All were approved per staff recommendations. If you have questions about the details, I'm happy to go over those with you.
BOARD OF APPEALS:
The Board of Appeals’ last hearing was August 22nd but I don't believe I have been able to provide a report since that so I will give a brief update. Three items: 4201 Judah, the Beach Motel, letter of determination from 1997, continued to the call of chair for several years. The letter of determination found it was a residential hotel, not a tourist hotel. The property owner was able to provide new information to the Board of Appeals that demonstrated this was a tourist hotel so it is in existence as a legal use. They have a termination date so they need to pursue a Conditional Use Authorization to use it as a tourist hotel. That would be before this Commission in the coming months. The second was 135 El Camino Del Mar. This was a discretionary review and variance denial. This was the property next to the sinkhole on El Camino Del Mar and 24thAvenue. The commission had taken discretionary view and approved the project based upon plans that were submitted with the initial modifications and rebuild of the project in the late 90s. They had subsequently made many additions, with some that encroached on related properties and needed variances but the Commission was clear in going back to what you approved more than a decade ago. The Board of Appeals upheld this unanimously. The notice of decision order was issued yesterday, so now we will pursue enforcement with the Department of Building Inspection to ensure that they come into compliance with the Commission's decision. The final item was 2101 Washington. Actually, Lafayette Park, this was an appeal of the building permit to do alterations to the park. There was an appeal. The Board of Appeals unanimously upheld the permit. Just on Tuesday a rehearing request was filed so this will be heard again by the Board of Appeals on September 19th– it is a hearing to determine whether or not they will have a rehearing of the item. We will keep you apprised of that as well.
