C.COMMISSIONERSâ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
4.         Commission Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements.  Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Moore:Iâd like to acknowledge staff winning the Charter Award from the congress of New Urbanism on the Better Streets Plan.  It is a highly coveted awards program with hundreds of submittals and roughly 12 awards being given under the category of Block, Street and Building.  It is great achievement and I think it puts San Francisco again on the map for how we maintain our urban infrastructure and moving it more from car-dependant streets to pedestrian oriented, character given, city image type of streets.  Iâm really happy about that.  The second thing Iâd like to ask is regarding an item that is on the latter part of our calendar today.  I got several calls from people in the community about whether SFGOVTV will be broadcasting our 6:00 hearing.  Many people cannot come, but they have a great deal of interest to hear the discussion between the two commissions on CPMC.  I hope we will get a positive nod on my question.
Secretary Avery:Generally SFGTV broadcasts this commission as long as we are in session and this commission will be in session as part of the joint hearing, so I can only affirm that we will be broadcast.
Commissioner Antonini:          I met with Ben [Goalvin] from a group that is involved with the Booker T. Washington â 800 Presidio project, and Iâve also met with some neighborhood groups that are concerned with the project; Iâve met with representatives of United Paragon and George [Yourby] and other companies involved in Executive Park which will be before us in a couple of weeks; and thirdly I was happy to hear that Mayor Lee has proposed an idea to perhaps eliminate payroll tax which would be a huge incentive for businesses to stay in San Francisco.
Commissioner Fong:   I too had an opportunity to go out and take a look at the Booker T. Washington site and have met with neighbors as well.  I also took a tour of Executive Park and I agree that going out there physically and seeing the location of the proposed project is beneficial.
Commissioner Miguel: During the week I met with people regarding Hyde Street, Edgewood, and Lansing, as well as a coalition of groups on CPMC.  I had the pleasure of attending a noon time forum at the Department partially on the Chinatown T-line extension, but more generally on social equity projects in the city.  It was very well attended at the Department.
Commissioner Antonini:          I also met with groups regarding, I believe, 1945 Hyde and 45 Lansing in the last week.
5.         Directorâs Announcements
Director Rahaim:          I also want to acknowledge as Commissioner Moore did, staffâs work in getting the recognition on the Better Streets Plan, an award by the Congress for New Urbanism.  It was one of nine awards given this year and it is a very prestigious award.  I want to thank staff, particularly David Alumbaugh and Adam Varat who is the Project Manager on that, and congratulate them.
If I might, I want to spend a couple of minutes updating the Commission on the status of the Governorâs proposed legislation regarding Redevelopment Agencies.  Initially the Governor proposed eliminating the tax-increment financing function which is the primary funding for Redevelopment Agencies and its activities.  The City, along with nine other cities in the state, proposed an alternative measure to that to allow some funding from tax-increment to go back into the statâs coffers.  Two weeks ago the Governor rejected that proposal.  Subsequent to that there has been a trailer piece of budget legislation submitted by the State Finance Department to require the elimination of the Redevelopment Agency by July 1.  It would require them to be dissolved by July 1 of this year and it would require them, immediately upon the signature of the Governor, to cease all activities other than paying out contractual obligated funding.  This could happen in the next week or two and that would go into effect immediately.  Besides the existing Redevelopment Plans, there is some provision in this legislation that would allow some plans that have reached a certain completion to continue.  It is not totally clear what that means in the legislation.  In addition, the legislation does allow what is called a âsuccessor agencyâ that would carry out the fiduciary responsibility of the Redevelopment Agency â namely to pay the bills that they have agreed to pay under contract.  Specifically with regard to the Planning Department, there are two obvious ways that we will have to get involved if this should go forward.  One is that we would likely be asked to take over the planning and entitlement functions within all the Redevelopment areas.  That would add substantially to the portfolio of the Department overnight.  That clearly has budgetary staffing implications that we would have to figure out.  The second thing is the zoning â the code function on those sites which is under the jurisdiction of the Agency.  So within the short timeframe that we have, we would likely be putting forward legislation that would convert the existing Redevelopment Agency zoning to city code zoning which would have to effective July 1 in order for the cityâs Planning Code to take over the control of the sites in the Redevelopment areas.  That is the status as I know it.
6.         Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
Board of Supervisors:
Land Use Committee:
·Zoning Map Amendment â Correction to Market and Octavia Area Plan:This proposed ordinance, sponsored by Supervisor Mirkarimi, would amend the zoning map to reflect the actions by the commission.  The Planning commission approved the Market & Octavia Plan on 4/5/07.  At some point after transmittal of the commissionâs recommendations to the Board and prior to final action by the Board, some of the pages of the zoning map ordinance were inadvertently omitted.  Although the Board voted on zoning maps that were consistent with the Commissionâs action, some of the pages that listed the zoning changes were not included.  The proposed ordinance heard by the Land Use Committee would correct this error.  This week the Committee recommended approval of the ordinance to the full Board.
·Upper Fillmore NCD changes:This proposed ordinance, sponsored by Supervisor Farrell, would remove the current prohibition against new restaurants in this NCD.  Under the proposal, restaurants would be allowed by CU.  This Commission considered the ordinance on 1/13/10.  At that time you recommended approval but with the recommendation to also allow large fast-food restaurants by CU.  You also respectfully requested that the supervisor continue additional public outreach.  Since your recommendation, the supervisor worked with the Department and appropriate merchants and neighborhood groups.  The Supervisor then amended the legislation in three ways.  First, per your request, the ordinance would now allow large fast-food restaurants.  Second, the legislation was also amended to specify that when the Commission considers restaurants in this area, the Commission shall consider whether the use would propose lunch service or other daytime usages in order to limit the number of such businesses that have no daytime activity.  Lastly, the ordinance would allow a new bar via CU when that bar is provided in conjunction with a full-service restaurant.  With these amendments, the Land Use Committee recommended approval of the ordinance.
·Development Impact and In-Lieu Fees:  This ordinance, sponsored by the Mayor, would amend Article 4 to clarify language, eliminate confusion as to when the requirements must be met, increase consistency between the way impact fees are administered and correct errors in cross-referencing.  Commissioners, you heard this item on 12/16/10.  At that time you recommended approval.  Since you heard the ordinance, the mayor has amended it to include suggestions from both the Mayorâs Office of Housing and the Controllerâs Office.  Among these changes was the addition of an uncodified section that will allow this yearâs adjustment of all fees for inflation in April.  With these amendments, the Land Use Committee recommended approval to the Full Board.
Full Board of Supervisors:
·Area Plan Waiver Criteria for Affordable housing:This proposed ordinance would amend the existing waiver of certain Area Plan fees.  The proposed changes contained in this ordinance were considered by the Planning Commission on 12/9/10 as part of a proposed ordinance to amend the Visitacion Valley Amendment.  At that time, the Planning Department recommended that the legislation be approved as proposed but the Commission did not pass a recommendation.  Instead, the Commission made a respectful recommendation that supervisor Maxwell continue working with all parties on the issue of fees.  This week the Board approved the ordinance on first read.
Introductions at the Board of Supervisors of by the Mayor:
·Ordinance amending Planning Code Section 608.14 regarding the authorization of historic signs, introduced by Supervisor Campos:This ordinance is meant to address the âCoke Signâ in Bernal Heights.
·Ordinance amending Planning Code Section 781.4, introduced by Supervisor Mar:  This amendment would prohibit formula retail pet supply stores in the Geary Blvd. Fast-Food Subdistrict and would change the name of the Subdistrict to reflect this new prohibited use.
·Ordinance introduced by the Mayor to amend the Administrative Code regarding Conversion of Large Tourist Hotels to Condominium Projects:This ordinance would extend the deadline for Planning Commission approval of applications for conversion of Large Tourist Hotels to condominium projects.  Commissioners, unlike the other ordinances, this ordinance does not amend the Planning Code.  Therefore, we would like your guidance as to whether you would like a hearing on this item so that you may make recommendations to the Board.
Hearing Requests:
·Supervisor Elsberndrequested an informational hearing on Park Merced
·The Mayorrequested an informational hearing on Treasure Island/Yerba Buena Island
Board of Appeals:
·1338 Filbert Streetâ a jurisdictional request:  The Board continued the item for one week to get additional information
·2601 Van Ness Avenueâ a jurisdictional request:  The Board denied the request
·280 Divisadero Streetâ appeal on a Certificate of Appropriateness:  With only 4 Board members present, a unanimous vote would be needed to overturn the Commission and the Board was split, so the item was continued to May to allow more time
·134-136 Ord Streetâ the building permit was withdrawn prior to the hearing
Historic Preservation Commission:
