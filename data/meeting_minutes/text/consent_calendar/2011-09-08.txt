At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a 
Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda

Commissioner Moore:
I just wanted to bring to 
the Commission's attention the September issue of "Scientific American" magazine 
under the title Better Cities.  I strongly recommend that you acquire this 
magazine and read it. It is not so much about policy, but rather general 
reflections on the City.
Commissioner Antonini:
I would like to ask that 
we adjourn tonight meeting or today's meeting in memory of a couple of 
individuals who died in our absence. First is Don Casper. He was a longtime 
Civil Service Commissioner, an attorney, a leader in the community and the 
Columbus Day celebrations and active in San Francisco politics and tragically 
was hit by a hit-and-run driver on the Russian River on his nightly run that he 
would take for years and years.  And unfortunately, the individual involved has 
not been apprehended. There is a reward fund.  The second individual was Gasper 
âTroâ Puchitzek.  He was a 22 year old gentleman who was working two jobs to 
support his wife and two children. He would work at night in a restaurant and he 
would work as a baker in the morning, he was taking a break between his two 
jobs, and he was shot and killed because he was mistaken to be a member of a 
gang, which he was not, as far as we know. Fortunately, there has been a reward 
fund set up at Wells Fargo Bank. I think the restaurant will also have an event 
in his honor. But I think this is totally unacceptable, this kind of behavior in 
our City or anywhere. Hopefully, there will be a reward fund set up in this 
instance as well because this is a way to stop this â if somebody comes forward 
and arrests are made. Anyway, those are the two individuals I would like to 
adjourn the meeting in their memories.
Commissioner Olague:
If you could be sure to 
give me the spelling of their names, at the end or during the break, I also 
wanted to include in that Eric Quezada, who passed away during the break (the 
Commissionâs summer Hiatus). He was a very valuable member of the Mission 
community. He has been sick for a number of years, and he leaves behind a wife.
Commissioner Miguel:
Over the break, I ended up 
talking to more people than I thought I would on a break. I had a meeting with 
the Port regarding their involvement in 8th and Washington and Seawall lot 41. I 
had an interesting conversation with Dan on the Veterans Affairs Medical Center. 
There was an excellent meeting that I helped chair regarding the Market Street 
Redesign that is coming up. I met with some people regarding the Recreation and 
Open Space Element of the General Plan, particularly in regards to Golden Gate 
Park. I have met with a number of people on CPMC as well as the budget analyst 
on their work with the Department. I also was updated on the Safeway redesign 
proposed out at Ocean Beach as well as a couple of meetings regarding an item 
that is on our calendar today.
Commissioner Olague:
I just wanted to finish my 
comments. He (Eric Quezada) leaves behind a wife and daughter, and quite a 
legacy in the Mission. He led a lot of the Mission advocates.  He was an 
activist and really fought hard for everyone across the border or boundary of 
residence. Latino families, LGBTQ communities, and he was a valuable member of 
the District and Community, so it is quite a loss, an irreplaceable loss.
Commissioner Sugaya:
I would like to echo 
Commissioner Olagueâs sentiments. I was not a personal friend of his, but the 
only time I think I really saw him here was at Commission meetings, and he was 
always a very forceful advocate for housing and community affairs in the Mission 
District. I think he was also a fair person. I think it is quite appropriate 
that we adjourn in his memory.
There was an article in 
the paper about Hunters Point Shipyard and the Navy's cleaning process, which I 
think they are saying at least in the paper would take until at least 2017, but 
there was another article in the paper that said that HUD or one of the Federal 
Agencies had granted some additional money for the project for the corporation 
to start to move ahead. I assume that the Navy clean up will affects only 
certain parts of the neighborhood. Maybe we could have a little short report on 
where the Navy's activities are preventing development from moving ahead. 
Lastly, there was also another article in a different -- you might characterize 
it progressive -- paper about the twitter deal, so-called, and the fact that in 
the development of the agreements, there were -- community benefits were not 
discussed up front or something to that matter, and it was still on the table 
with respect to a Committee or somebody that is supposed to determine what the 
community benefits would be for various corporations and others coming in to the 
neighborhood. since -- who is it? since somebody or other just moved into 
Mid-Market. I wonder what the process is here to talk about community benefits.
Commissioner Moore:
I would ask the Director 
to give us an update about redevelopment on the Bayview/Hunters Point, because 
an article I read seemed to imply that although all the projects were important 
to us, this will be, because of the change in the development, the last one to 
be realized. I am very disturbed about hearing as to whether or not what I am 
seeing and quoting is rumor or whether or not there's factual basis to it. I 
very much appreciate all of us getting a thorough update, including how it 
attaches to Commissioner Sugayaâs comment about the cleanup. If I understand 
correctly, it has to be completed prior to any activity on that portion of 
Bayview-Hunters Point. I think there is a much larger issue including Eastern 
Neighborhoods, etc., so I think we would all be well informed getting an update 
from you if you can.
Commissioner Antonini:
In keeping with 
Commissioner Sugayaâs remarks, it tweaked my memory that I also read the article 
on Hunters Point and I talked to the author. I thought he did a really good job, 
but what it did not specify is that parts of the cleanup are finished and will 
be ready for development as early as 2012, and those parts include the possible 
stadium site, the park area around it, and parking areas in whatever parcel that 
is. I think the comment that everything was going to be ready by 2017 was a 
little bit exaggerated. He May write a follow-up on that, but I just wanted to 
clarify that. It was a little confusing to me.
Commissioner Fong:
I just wanted to say that 
I did take a meeting with the Buddhist Center and did have a meeting with the 
operators at a restaurant.
Commissioner Olague:
I spoke with Commissioner Borden and a few members of the African-American 
Community, and I believe there is interest in having a hearing to follow up on 
the task force findings on the out migration of African-Americans from San 
Francisco. We will work on that. Commissioner Borden is in support of having 
this because the task force came up with these findings.  And then we want to 
look at what is next on that or not, or how is the City being accountable to the 
findings of that report?  And what additional information needs to be gathered 
that maybe we should advocate?  But we would definitely like a report on that.

Directorâs Announcements
John Rahaim â Director of Planning:
I hope everyone had a 
long, restful break â August recess. I know it was something that several of us 
needed. I hope you are ready for a very busy fall, because the calendars are 
very busy for the next few weeks. Regarding the Hunters Point Project, I think 
it is a good suggestion that we pull together information. I think there was 
support of a substantial grant from HUD that will allow the project to go 
forward, but we will certainly give you more updated information on that, 
certainly with respect to the cleanup and the status of the Redevelopment 
Agency. The only other thing I wanted to mention was that yesterday there was a 
press conference at the Transbay terminal site. It was to celebrate the 
completion of demolition of the old Transbay terminal and the start of 
construction of the new Transit Center District. In a heads up that at the end 
of this month we will release the draft for the Transit Center District Plan. We 
have been working on this plan for the past couple of years, and we are 
scheduling a couple more informational hearings before the end of the year as 
this process moves forward. Currently we're looking at an early November date 
for hearing at the Commission. With that, that is it for me, unless there are 
any questions.
11.Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of 
Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
LAND USE COMMITTEE:  cancelled this 
week
FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
§Limited Live Performance.Commissioners, you heard this item sponsored by Supervisor Mirkarimi on July 7.  
This Ordinance would to create a Limited Live Performance Permit for indoor 
locales whose primary function is not presentation of live performances.  At 
that time, you recommended approval with modifications. You requested that the 
Ordinance be amended to extend the opportunity for small-scale entertainment to 
be considered an accessory use in the SOMA, West Portal, and Pacific Avenue 
districts.  At the Land Use hearing Supervisor Mirkarimi incorporated all of 
your modifications, except one.  On the request of Supervisor Kim, he has 
amended the Ordinance so that it allows this entertainment use in the SoMa 
Districtsâbut only in the areasnotinvolved in the Western SoMa 
Community Planning Process.  At the first Full Board hearing, Board President 
Chiu and Supervisor Farrell introduced amendments for their districts that would 
not permit an extension in hours beyond 10pm for the Union Street, Chestnut, 
North Beach and Polk St Commercial Districts[1].  
Supervisor Farrell also added a noticing provision where interested parties 
could âopt-inâ and request notice about LLE permits.With these amendments, 
this week the Full Board passed the Ordinance on FINAL reading.
§660 4th StreetCat Ex Appeal-This appeal is 
about the CEQA determination for wireless antennas at 660 4th Street.Commissioners, on July 7, you heard the associated Conditional Use authorization 
relating to this project.  While the CU was not appealed, it is interesting to 
note that there were no speakers against the CU and only 2 letters were received 
in opposition.  For this CEQA appeal, the appellant argued that the Department 
did not consider potential health impacts in our review of this installation.Under CEQAâs purview, when exploring potential health impacts, the question 
is does the proposal comply with the health guidelines established by the FCC?  
For this project, the answer was clearly yes.  Once that question has been 
answered, CEQA is satisfied.At the appeal hearing this week, the sole 
speaker of content was the appellant.  Staff explained how the radiofrequency 
exclusion zones on the roof were not publicly accessible.   After short 
presentations from the Department and the project sponsor, the Board upheld the 
Cat Ex 11-0.Two Board members (Supervisor Kim and Campos) asked staff 
questions at the hearing that were outside of CEQA.
oSupervisor Kim would like a copy of DPHâs report on the actual RF levels after 
antennae installation.  At the hearing, Planning staff explained that typically 
the projected levels are conservative and the actual RF levels will most likely 
be lower.  And, further we explained that the City, through DPH, has the 
authority to order immediate compliance with FCC regulations if the FCC 
standards are exceeded.
oSecond, Supervisor Campos had specific questions about how rooftop workers would 
be informed of the exclusion zones and specifically how they would be informed 
about the proper steps that would need to be taken if they needed to work in 
this area.
oPlanning has committed to work with DPH to get this information to both 
Supervisors.
INTRODUCTIONS:  NONE
Board of Appeals:
The Board of Appeals has been on a long recess, much as the Commission has. They 
will be meeting again next week. The last hearing was on August 17. There were 
two items of interest from that hearing. The first was 1633 Haight Street, a 
permit to reinstall general advertising sign at the location. It ultimately led 
to the removal of the sign. This permits sought to restore it. The Department 
denied that. The Board of Appeals did uphold the Department's decision to deny 
that replacement. The second item was a discretionary review that the department 
had brought before the Commission. The project sought to add a third floor to a 
single-family dwelling and the Department recommended a 15-foot front setback 
and a four-foot rear setback. The Board of Appeals did unanimously overturn the 
Commission's decision to allow the project to move forward as they originally 
proposed. There was actually no neighborhood opposition on that project. There 
was significant public support for their project.
HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:
They did not take a summer recess and there were only two items on calendar that 
might be of interest to you. One was 1460 Montgomery Street â a request for a 
Certificate of Appropriateness. They had met before and were always concerned 
about the design and how they were impacting the open space. The Commission 
actually felt the open space would be impacted, and they were not inclined to 
grant the Certificate of Appropriateness. They did allow, and actually there was 
a motion on the floor to disapprove it, but they were then given an option to go 
back and redesign it to try to mitigate the invasion into the open space area. 
The item was continued before the HPC to a date to be determined, but it was 
directed to go before the Architectural Review Committee for the Commission at 
its next meeting. The last item was Articles 10 and 11. I will note that 
Supervisor Wiener sent his proposal for revision of Articles 10 and 11, but the 
Commission stated they have not had an opportunity to review his proposals, so 
did not consider them at the meeting yesterday. They did however pass a motion 
of intent to make changes to Article 10. They will bring them back at their next 
hearing when they consider Article 11.
