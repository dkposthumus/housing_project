C.COMMISSIONERSâ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
5.         Commission Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements.  Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Antonini:
Just a few comments and some questions on some general things we struggle with all the time. I think it is very important that the public understand that we often have to differentiate between negative impacts that a business will have and positive impacts.  And sometimes a lot of attention is paid to the negative side and very little to the positive side. I interpret negative impacts as impacts on light and air and traffic, perhaps causing negative effects on neighboring businesses and things like that.  Whereas positive impacts such as adding jobs and increasing property values and, you know, less crime and fewer vacancies -- I mean, these have to be addressed. My feeling is we are not obliged to mitigate a positive impact, but our job is to mitigate negative impacts. Also, when we talk about groups in the community, we have to make sure that we always get a representative sample of groups from a community and not just one group for pretense or that purports that they represent the community and that be the only group we listen to. Obviously, it is always whoever comes to us and speaks, those are the ones we hear from and the ones that do not come, we do not hear from, but we have to be really knowledgeable about who really does live within an area and who represents the area.
Finally, there has been a lot of discussion on the subject of profits and nonprofits and those sorts of things. I think what the public has to understand, and I think most of them do, is there's nothing wrong with having a profit. If you are a viable business, you probably better have a profit. For accounting purposes, a lot of times they plough the money back into equipment, you cannot spent it all in the same year. The same with a real estate acquisition - the principle is not deductible. You will by necessity show a profit. I think that if you -- just because a particular company has a profit does not mean that there is something wrong with them.  In fact, it may be that a lot of it is being funneled back into investments. Then I have questions for staff. I spoke to some of the staff regarding this, and it has to do with the Van Ness Special Use District, which we have heard a lot about but never really gotten any paper work on. We will be asked to make some decisions in regards to this without actually having the plan before us. I have asked planning staff to provide at least a memo that summarizes it; so we can read them over and understand what is actually asked here; understanding in terms of the housing for the Van Ness Special Use District; that a significant portion of the units we have asked for in the 1970's and 1980's have actually already been built; and a few more are entitled. It is important to know where we are on the goal for this plan and it (a staff summary) will satisfy a lot of it.  We may have different ideas.Also, I want to know about exceptions.  I pointed out in the past and as for answers about the former Lincoln-Mercury Dealership that is now a theater and has parking and apparently does have some condominiums in there as well, but I wonder if the ratio is really 3to1 housing. The same with the San Francisco Ford, which regrettably may be closing, but that is an automotive dealerships that is a new business and new use of that space prior to what was there. I am wondering how we have applied this housing requirement in the past on other projects that have come forward. So those are a couple of things.
Finally, and this is also in regards to the entire California Pacific issue. I do not know if Planning can do this, and it may have to get some counseling, but we really need to have some accurate figures on charitable contributions by hospitals and kind of compare these by staff, not just by what someone brings up in discussion, which I did not necessarily think those statistics have to be used as accurate. Staff has to do the work to figure of what kind of contributions from two hospitals, such as Stanford, or California Pacific, or Catholic Healthcare West, or Kaiser, or UCSF. As we move forward on the issue, we have to move forward with good documents and good information because we cannot make informed decisions unless we have good information. I am thankful for the work staff has done, they have been doing a great job, but we have to go a little further before we can have all the facts.
Commissioner Moore:
I went to a SPUR meeting on Tuesday. Sarah Dennis was representing the Planning Department, and someone from the Mayor's Office of Housing, and someone from ABAG.  There was a strong discussion focusing on the role of the region and particularly San Francisco's role in looking at gentrification. I think we are on a very good track. It might make sense to have an abbreviated version of that particular presentation in front of the Commission. There are many challenges, obviously, of what that all means physically. There were only two sides in that discussion. Some of us had some problems with the project because it only had densification at ParkMerced and Treasure Island, but the rest of the City was spare. It would be interesting if indeed at some point, the Department could find a grant to really look with a fine tooth comb under the microscope of how intensification really physically can happen. The next question is a question to the Director. The Senate in Sacramento passed a budget last night, very late, but there is an indication that it might have an effect on the continuance of Redevelopment as we know it. As the details become more available, I asked if you could please keep us updated and what the changes mean for you and for us.
President Olague:
We have raised this question before, the topic of tourism. Can we think about tentatively scheduling a time in September to do a presentation on that issue? I know that Commissioner Fong and others have raised it in the past? Maybe late September? I think that would give us time to prepare.
Director Rahaim:
I had an initial conversation with the Director, but I am happy to talk to him and schedule a time with him in the coming weeks. They have done some very good work, as Commissioner Fong has indicated.
President Olague:
Great, we have been talking about over- saturation of alcohol and other items. We may want to revisit that on some levels, at some point.
6.Directorâs Announcements
Director Rahaim:
We're having a series of four public workshops related to the early stages of the CentralCorridor Plan, which is the Fourth Street Corridor Plan that we have talked to you about.There are four community meetings in a row, June 22, 23,  24, and 25 at the Eugene Coleman Committee House on Howard Street between Fourth and Fifth Streets. We are looking at the direction that plan could go and how we can proceed in the coming months. Second, there is a Glen Park Community Plan meeting on June 22. This is the latest meeting regarding the Glen Park Plan, 6:30 until 8:30 at St. John's Elementary School on the evening of June 22.  And last, I just want to give you the highlights:  There was a memo regarding the budget in your packet.  I had asked Tom to prepare this just to let you know that the budget that you approved, after it left the Mayor's Office, there were some changes to it.  That typically happens every year, of course, and in this case what has happened is there were additions made to our budgetâs General Fund allocations. That is a little unusual. But specifically, the Mayor's Office added funding as it relates to the Americaâs Cup for the staffing work â for the first year of work on the Master Plant â it would cover the staff costs and environmental review for the first year.  The changes also reflect changes in state grants that we received.  Again, this is not approved yet because it still has to be sent to the Board.  But I think after you approve the budget, we received $400,000 in grants from FTC related to the Central Project Corridor.
7.Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
LAND USE COMMITTEE:
§BF Various Executive Park.This week the Land Use Committee considered amendments to the General Plan, Planning Code and Zoning Map that would enable mixed-use development in an area that had been zoned for suburban style office and hotel development.  Commissioners, you heard this item on May 5th at which time you recommended approval with modifications to enable the relocation of one tower one block towards the east.  An addendum to the EIR was completed to assure no new impacts were created prior to the hearing.  At this weekâs hearing, the Committee considered the actions as recommended by the Planning Commission, including the relocation of a tower.The Committee made amendments to the Ordinances changing proposed Planning Code text regarding the tower location and continued the item as amended.
