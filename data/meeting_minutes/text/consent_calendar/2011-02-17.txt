Commissioner Moore:
I read an article which I 
would like to share with you in case you did not see it. It is titled San 
Francisco's Precarious Spot Among The Best Cities For Transit. As we are 
pushing  hard every day or every Thursday in supporting transit and public 
transportation, among the first top 10 cities, unfortunately, San Francisco only 
ranks sixth, one spot before Los Angeles. I found that rather sad, and I hope we 
can continue to contribute to making it better. If anybody has not seen the 
article, I would be happy to pass it around. It is really worthwhile reading. 
The second issue I would like to talk about is, I would like to ask for further 
clarification of last week, the Commission's approval for ParkMerced.  What I'd 
like to ask the Commission for is the following -- is the resolution that the 
Planning Commission passed last week already contain language that was the 
memorandum passed out by Mayor's Office of Economic Development and Work Force? 
That was the memo addressed to Planning Director Rahaim, regarding subsequent 
approvals and provisions -- is that -- does that memorandum contained language 
to not increase the City's obligation liabilities? Then it is likely out of 
Commissions hands for subsequent action. However, should there be an increase or 
changes. There will be something that this Commission should be appraised of at 
least. I asked that the development agreement are brought back to this 
Commission for information purposes and this Commission' s own determination as 
to whether any changes increase the City' s obligations, and there is a second 
point I would like to make regarding this fast-moving even. The memorandum 
states, "-- that there are significant aspects of the projects that fall under 
the jurisdiction of the SFPUC and SFMTA , and therefore, subject to review by 
the City. The Planning Commission always has been and always is a strong 
advocate for comprehensive policy and physical planning. I myself speak to that 
frequently in meetings with the PUC and MTA Commissions should be automatic. 
They should be initiated by staff and be part of the standard process we go 
through for any project that is complicated and as multifaceted as this. I think 
it would make the entire City look much better and would create much better 
interaction between Commissions and make better use of our time as we as private 
citizens spend a great deal to think and judge with that much information, which 
can be put together in a timely manner. I asked the commission to follow up and 
support me in this request.Commissioner Antonini:
Commissioner Moore raises 
an interesting point, but, as we know from having been here for a while, there 
are many times when approvals that we have changed significantly at the Board of 
Supervisors, certain parts of the legislation do have to go through the 
Supervisors, as other agencies, so there is a procedure in place for this, and 
certainly, that will take precedent, I think. I would like to dedicate today's 
meeting in memory of Gino Camoli, a 1947 graduate of Galileo and one of a long 
string of Italian baseball players to come out of San Francisco, and spent 10 
years in the Majors, had a couple of World Series rings, but the most 
significant thing about his baseball career -- he was the first batter on the 
West Coast for Major League Baseball. He was lying to the doctors at the time, 
and he stepped into the plate on April 15, 1915 - 1958. I think he struck out, 
which is good for us because the Giants were the home team. What is really 
significant is he went on for a career with ups after he finished his baseball 
career and was very active in the San Francisco Italian Athletic Club and was a 
lifetime resident of San Francisco and gave back a lot to the community. 
Certainly, a historic figure, particularly, in view of our World Series victory 
this year.
Commissioner Sugaya:
Just a follow-up on 
Commissioner Moore' s comments. I was also uncomfortable when we received the 
materials at the last minute -- actually at the hearing. Because I had just 
spent hours and hours going through the development agreement page by page.  
Also, had some comments on it during the hearing, and then have subsequently 
submitted three or four pages of written comments, mostly on the development 
agreement. If there were changes within that document, I do not know what they 
are at this point. So I did vote at that time, but it made me extremely 
uncomfortable in doing so. At the very least, I would think that we would want 
to have areport back from staff about the status of that particular document, and as it 
moves through the City' s process. I know at the end of the day, the Board of 
Supervisors will end up voting on it, but perhaps some status reports would be 
desirable. Then, one other thing -- as you know, the Tenderloin SRO 
Collaborative set up a tour for me a particular blocks in the Tenderloin, and 
that took place last Friday. Commissioner Moore attended, as a Supervisor Kim, 
whose District is part of Tenderloin. It lasted about an hour, and I think it 
was very informative in terms of the kinds of issues that they are facing as 
they try to improve conditions in the Tenderloin area. The other thing  I think 
that' s -- for people who doesnât know the Tenderloin, I think is not one -- and 
I said this to them while I was there -- not one, sort of monolithic uniform -- 
there are not drug dealers everywhere in the Tenderloin, and there are not 
particular -- you know, there are not liquor stores everywhere, like people 
might think, at least given the hearing that we had. We went down one block 
where there were a lot of grocery stores selling liquor, and when we turned the 
corner, there were not any, so I think there is a kind of diversity not only 
population-wise, but in terms of land use, and that kind of thing that people -- 
getting people who are not living there do not understand.It is a challenge to try to plan the kind of environment, and I think the people 
who were there for the tour, not only people from the City, but also, people 
from Channel Two and the "SF Weekly." idea it was really good that they had two 
residents from the community lead the tour, so I just wanted to report that back 
to the Commission and the public.
Commissioner Miguel:
There was an interesting 
gathering at the Department last night regarding the Housing Element, which will 
be coming to us, and interesting discussion from many points of views, and, 
hopefully, that is assisting in the process. I have met with people last week 
regarding projects on Presidio, and on Treasure Island.
Commissioner Moore: 
I just wanted to add a couple comments regarding the Tenderloin tour. I was 
actually amazed about the strong spirit of neighborhood, and people giving each 
other support in light of adversity. I was positively surprised about how 
uniform the buildings that tended to be maintained, in strong contrast to 
similar neighborhoods in Los Angeles -- South Central, for example, and really 
happy to see that people are finding an innovative way to deal with adversity. I 
felt very safe, well informed by the people and lead us, and for anybody 
interested in jazz, we just happened to look into an amazing event, which 
happens every second Friday of the month at 12:30 in the lobby of the Cadillac 
Hotel, and for anybody likes Jazz, you would be really blown away because it is 
quite amazing. So if anybody wants to find a reason to go there, every second 
Thursday at 12:30 in the lobby of the Cadillac Hotel.
Commissioner Borden:
I just wanted to add 
another name to end the meeting I am honored, and that is Henry Lancelot, who 
died on February 14. He was born to Italian immigrants on Telegraph Hill. That 
is where he grew up. He ran a market in North Beach for much of his life, and 
served on the Commission of the Boys and Girls Club until his death. He has been 
a huge supporter of the San Francisco community at large and the 
Italian-American community and North Beach, and he will be sorely missed, and 
actually, today is his funeral and memorial service.
Commissioner Olague:
I just wanted to mention 
that I do support Commissioner Moore' s request for some kind of an update, I 
guess, when it does get to he board. Whether, that is in the form of a memo or 
what. Just to understand the process, I think it is important to see how we 
needed, and how it evolves, especially something with this magnitude. The 
development agreement, I think, is something that is the purview of the Board 
anyway. We recognize that, but I still think it would be interesting to see how 
it will evolves.
John Rahaim, Director of Planning:
I' m happy to ask michael 
or staff to give you an update on the final version, how it might differ from 
the version that you saw last, so we can get that to you by the time it gets to 
the board.And also in keeping of our policy of talking about any meetings we have had, I 
was taken by project sponsored to 1500 henrik grant to view the prospective 
installations of cell phone antennas, and it was very interesting. An 
interesting eight-floor climb, which was better than the stairmaster, but you 
could see exactly where the projected installations would be and howlarge and how visually obvious or not they were, so it was a very good trip to 
take.
Commissioner Borden:
I just want to say I do 
support the hearing about the evolution of the development agreement, and I 
would like to hear what happened with the Hunters Point Shipyard. I know there 
were changes after that, in general, I think it would be interesting to look atthe large projects and how they end up at the end, compared to what we saw.I think that is true with other projects as well. I' m equally interested in 
that as well.Commissioner Olague:
Just to let folks know, 
there is a list of policies here that some of us will disclose some of the 
meetings we have had with different members of the public regarding various 
issues that relate to planning, but it is certainly the option of the 
Commission.  Not all of us disclose that, but it is certainly something we can 
discuss during the rules. But we all usually spend hours outside of here with 
the public and development community in different meetings.
Commissioner Moore:
In response to 
Commissioner Borden' s comment, we need to remember that there is a difference 
between the project that is under the jurisdiction or is a redevelopment project 
compared to one that is in private hands of developers. There is a slight 
difference.  I agree with the reading, but it is a little bit like apples and 
oranges.
Commissioner Olague: 
  Commissioners before we go on to call the Directorâs support, City  Attorney 
wants me to ask, for those people who are not here, for item 7, for instance, if 
you are here for items 64 for any of the later items, if you would be willing to 
give up your seat and allow people in the hall who are here for item 7 to come 
in so they can hear the presentation and a speaking before them, so they can be 
part of the process of that item, we would very much appreciate that.
John Rahaim, Director of Planning:
I want to thank 
Commissioner Miguel for coming to the latest meeting to discuss the Housing 
Element. It was, as you can imagine, a fairly lively discussion, which is often 
the case with the Housing Element, very diverse points of view. But we are 
bringing -- just as a reminder, we' e bringing it to you next week as an 
informational items and asking you to initiate the action on the general plan, 
which is now scheduled for March 24. I think in the interest of time, I will 
leave my report at that. Unless you have questions, I think Anmarie had a short 
report on the Board of Appeals.

Directorâs Announcements
5.         Review 
of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and 
Historic Preservation Commission.
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
None
BOARD OF APPEALS:
This week in Upper Market 
on final read this week as well as final week â final read on the Rincon Hillâs 
ordinance. Board of Appeals heard the variance on Lombard Street, across the 
street from an item that is on your calendar later today. But the case that was 
before the Board of Appeals was the subject of a subject Discretionary Review 
hearing -- of a joint Discretionary Review hearing. The Commission approved the 
project and the Zoning Administrator granted the variance. On December 15, last 
year, the Board of Appeals upheld the subject variance four-one. It was 
initially scheduled for January 12. Opponents initially appealed the CEQA 
determination, and that was held through the Board of Spervisors. The Board of 
Appeals denied the jurisdiction request three-one.
HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:
Two items I bring to your 
attention are the division pipeline, three and four, off by the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers, and the Commission, after discussion, found that they concur with 
the areas that were put before them for review. They also, after refusing two of 
their members, and one absence, so we just had corum, but they did pass the SOMA 
historic resourced survey. For about the past six months, since they actually 
gave the Department authority to approve, minor permits to alter, there have 
been no discussions. They have not pulled them out to further review by 
themselves, so they actually -- one of the members actually requested that we 
stop putting them on their calendar and just let the Department go forward with 
their approval process. There was no decision on that, but I just wanted you to 
know that they are satisfied with the work staff is doing, and they do not feel 
is necessary to add that extra step at a longer period with that, commissioners, 
that concludes my report.-- they do not feel it is necessary to add that extra 
step any longer. That concludes my report.
Commissioner Antonini:
Are there plans for the 
Historic Preservation Commission to be broadcast? I ask the question because it 
is a little bit important, I think, for me, still getting up to speed, to find 
out what this thing is.
Linda Avery, Commission Secretary:
Commissioners your 
concerns are shared by quite a few people, Commissioners included. At the 
moment, the Department does not have a budget to allow them to be broadcast.What we do is we digitally record and up load that recording. Generally the day 
after the hearing, you can go online and get the entire hearing. You do not get 
the visual, but you get the audio.Commissioner Antonini:
I think, being the great 
historic city that we are, and myself, is wonderful to be interested in hearing 
what the Commission is discussing, and to have the ability to see this on TV for 
many people I think would be great. We could find it in the budget, and if the 
General Manager ofSFGTV would help us out, that would be great.
