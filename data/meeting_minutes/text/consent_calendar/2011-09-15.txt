C.COMMISSIONERSâ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
11.        Commission 
Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements.  
Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or 
inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future 
Meetings/Agendas.  
At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a 
Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda 
of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Olague:
I had a statement I wanted to read into the record regarding 
the postponement of the September 22 meeting. I wanted to make sure that it was 
clearly put into the record.  I will postpone the September 22 initiation 
hearing that had been listed in our event calendar [regarding CPMC]. City staff 
has been updating us on the progress of negotiations and I am pleased with the 
progress to date. I am encouraged that they have come to the table to negotiate, 
and pleased with the creativity of the proposals. I am confident that these 
discussions will yield a better project, but I believe that we need more time. 
While it is not a legal requirement, we do not initiate a project without a more 
complete snapshot of what the agreement will be. We usually have an agreement 
before us that is something a little bit more robust than we currently have at 
the table. I understand that the City is not ready to present a development 
agreement to the Commission or the public. I will postpone the September 22 
hearing indefinitely. I discussed this with the Mayor's Office and we agree that 
this is the best course of action at this time. I want to read a letter from the 
mayor. Thank you for informing me that you have decided to postpone the 
initiation hearing. I understand and support your decision to hold of this to a 
later date with a more developed agreement that can be presented to the 
Commission and the public. I released a set of requests in conjunction with the 
hospital rebuilding program. These requests covered access to health care for 
the poor and underserved, affordable housing, work force development, and other 
community benefits. I am pleased to report that substantial progress has been 
made at arriving at a framework for agreements that meet the goals of the City's 
set of requests.  Building seismically safe hospitals while ensuring increased 
health care for the needy, increasing affordable housing and other critical 
community benefits, I have directed my staff to move forward as quickly as 
possible to finalize an agreement with CPMC and bring it to your Commission and 
colleagues in the near future for your consideration. Thank you for your hard 
work and diligence in considering these projects. Sincerely, Edwin M. Lee, Mayor 
of the City and County of San Francisco. I would just want to let people know 
the rationale behind postponing the initiation hearing.
Commissioner Moore:
I just wanted to bring to people's attention an article I was 
focused on this morning in keeping close tabs with staff regarding bird-safe 
concerns and standards. I am very happy to hear that it passed 3-0. I am sure 
Miss Rogers will report on that. This will still go to the Board of Supervisors, 
and while there is still some resistance from organizations, we have originally 
heard from them ourselves, it is very encouraging to hear that the New York 
Times had an article this morning mentioning San Francisco is just about to 
adopt what many cities across the U.S. have done.  The Federal Government is 
about to consider adopting standards for Federal buildings, it will be adjusted 
as criteria [is adopted] in November. I think it sends a strong message, and I 
think our Department is strongly supporting what they are trying to achieve.
Commissioner Miguel:
I just want  to report that I have had some meetings during 
the week, one in particular regarding the GGNRA, regarding the Federal lands as 
they will be affected by America' s Cup both next year and the following year. I 
met with representatives from CPMC and Saint Luke's. Last evening, the Director 
was there and Commissioner Antonini was there for the Annual Housing Hero Award. 
The items put forward by this Commission and passed by the Board of Supervisors 
were Treasure Island Housing and Park Merced Housing â those people were honored 
last night.
Commissioner Antonini:
I too was present as Commissioner Miguel mentioned at the 
meeting last night. I thought it was extremely well done.
Commissioner Sugaya:
I have attended a couple ofJapanTownBetter 
Neighborhood Planning meetings over the last several weeks and they are on track 
as far as I know with respect to getting -- I don' t know how to characterize it 
â Getting their act together and deciding what needs to be changed. I was 
encouraged that there were quite a few people at Saturday morning's meeting. 
They're going into committees and working with staff to continue the Better 
Neighborhood Planning Act.
Commissioner Moore:
I failed to mention, as you 
probably know, at the Waterfront Design Advisory, they convened a meeting last 
Tuesday for a general discussion about America's Cup. There was a lot of new 
information coming in. It starts to ask questions, particularly as we are seeing 
similar events being held in Portugal, England and San Diego. There is a lot to 
learn and to observe.  As the other events happen, a story will unfold so we can 
understand the programmatic implications. I hope they will keep us posted on the 
individual reports.
12.Directorâs Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Just one announcement today for 
the public and for the Commission â the next meeting to discuss the Proposed 
Historic District is next Tuesday, the 20that 7:00 P.M. at the CPMC 
Davies Campus. I was also gratified to see that article in the N.Y. Times today 
about the friendly guidelines. I entered the process a bit skeptical about the 
need for that and have become convinced that it is the right thing to do. A 
number of cities are looking at it as the right thing to do. There is positive 
feedback as well.
13.        Review of Past 
Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic 
Preservation Commission.
LAND USE COMMITTEE:
FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:INTRODUCTIONS:  NONE
Board 
of Appeals:
The Board of Appeals did meet last night it was the 
replacement of a billboard.  I reported that the Board had denied restoration of 
the billboard pursuant to the allowance for a re-hearing request.As you know, when there is manifest that could be presented at the time of the 
original presentation, they voted unanimously to deny the re- hearing or 
request. There could of been support for the appellant of the first time around 
and voted no because no new facts had been presented, and there was no manifest 
injustice. One item that they will be considering is 1731 15thStreet. There were members of the public last week that spoke about that. And 
just to remind the Commission that they cannot take any action on permits under 
the purview of the Board of Appeals. We cannot revoke it. It is up to the Board 
hearing to take action.
