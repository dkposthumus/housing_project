Re:       
It was very refreshing that this hearing started on time â even through no one 
showed up for it.  However, I want to thank you for getting your ducks in a row 
on that, and especially Ms. Avery.  I was watching your hearing all day today 
and she very specifically was on you about making sure that you are scheduling.  
So Ms. Avery, I want to thank you for being a good heard-rider on these folks.
