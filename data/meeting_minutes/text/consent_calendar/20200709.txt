339 TARAVAL STREET – southeast corner of Taraval Street and 14th Avenue; Lot 036 in 
Assessor’s Block 2412 (District 7) – Request for Conditional Use Authorization, pursuant to 
Planning Code Sections 178, 303, 745, and 781.1 to establish a full-service Restaurant 
(d.b.a. “Backroom Dining/Mango Medley”) within the Inner Taraval Street Neighborhood 
Commercial District (NCD), the Taraval Street Restaurant Subdistrict, and a 40-X Height and 
Bulk District. A rear portion of the property was authorized for Restaurant use in 2012; 
however, the use was abandoned as it stopped operating as a Bona-Fide Eating Place in 
2014. In 2018, the restaurant expanded into the existing street facing beauty salon without 
the benefit of a permit. Therefore, the CUA is required to 1) re-establish Restaurant use and 
2) legalize the change of use from Personal Service to Restaurant with the expansion 
greater than 25% of the existing use size. This project was reviewed under the Community 
Business Priority Processing Program (CB3P). This action constitutes the Approval Action 
for the project for the purposes of CEQA, pursuant to San Francisco Administrative Code 
Section 31.04(h).
