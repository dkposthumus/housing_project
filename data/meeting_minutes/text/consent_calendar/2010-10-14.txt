Inquiries/Announcements.  Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
Future Meetings/Agendas.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Moore:
The American Planning Association yesterday nominated the Ferry Building and its open spaces as one of the ten great public spaces of America for 2010.  This goes hand and hand with North Beach having been nominated two years ago as one of the great neighborhoods in the United States.  We have two down and a couple to go and Iâm very happy about this.
Commissioner Antonini:
For those of you who are old enough to remember the 1950âs and early â60âs in San Francisco; it was a city known for its style, its manners, its class and its cleanliness.  Lately, often in the national press we are pointed out, perhaps unfairly, as being a place that is characterized by rude and inappropriate behavior and sometimes as being un-disciplined.  Iâm not sure that is fair, but what I was impressed with was our San Francisco Giants after their win over the Braves when they stayed on the field and were respectful of Bobby Cox, who had been a manager for 33 years and spend his whole life in baseball, and his moment was much more important than their triumph in terms of the scope of baseball.  That really showed a lot of class.  That specific mention, not only for the Giants and for [   ], but he mentioned San Francisco because the team is often representative of the city in which they reside.  I think it was very good for San Francisco â that choice to do the right thing and be respectful.
Commissioner Borden:
Yesterday, I was at the San Francisco Heritage event.  There was a really wonderful young woman who is a graduate student who did a presentation on a plan she did looking at Market Street.  I thought it might be interesting if she did that presentation here at the Commission as an informational item.  I thought it was a great plan and would be of interest to the public.
Commissioner Miguel:
During the past week I have met with representatives of AT&T, and some of the items that are before us today â Elizabeth Street, 1095 Market Street and the [   ] Triangle.
Commissioner Moore:
I heard that yesterday evening, during the Giants game, even the ballpark was able to participate in recycling at a level highest in the country.  So they followed with an incredible performance and I just wanted to mention that because I thought it was a great achievement given the excitement and distraction which occur when you are at a big gathering like that.  It was a really great performance.
Commissioner Miguel:
Itâs jarring to me when I travel outside of San Francisco and are given Styrofoam containers and there is no place to dispose of recycling disposal.  We forget what we have here.  California is better than any other state Iâve seen.  San Francisco, by far, is the high point of the state.  If you go to the mid-west or visit family in New York â¦, its just jarring because we get so accustomed to it here.
Commissioner Sugaya:
I have a procedural issue.  Last week when I was not in attendance, when I was recused from the North Beach Library Environmental Report, apparently Mr. Martinez from the Historic Preservation Commission was giving a report.  And my concern is that he apparently was given only three minutes as a member of the public.
Commission Secretary:
That is not true.  I did not have the clock on him.
Commissioner Sugaya:
Well somebody said he got cut off.
Commission Secretary:
I did not have the clock on any presenter from the city.
Commissioner Miguel:
He finished and I said âthank you.â
Commissioner Sugaya:
Al right, so my information was wrong then.
My other issue is that the Historic Preservation Commission consideration of the DEIR was only on the Wednesday before the Thursday meeting.  I hope in the future that if there are DEIRâs with historic resource comments being made by HPC, that those meetings be held at least a week or two head of ours so that we can be the beneficiary of their minutes.
Commissioner Moore:
I think that would be a procedural matter and I have personally talked to Commissioner Martinez, that the Historic Preservation Commission starts to accept rules by which they on their own start to request that, because I would agree sometimes I would like to hear their opinion a little earlier, study it and bring it into the context of all the other things we are looking at.
6.         Directorâs Announcements
Director Rahaim:
I would also like to mention the APA Award.  I attended the ceremony and spoke on behalf of the Department and the Commission.  I thanked the APA for that award.  There were 10 awards given this year for great places in America and that ceremony took place in front of the Ferry Building yesterday with the CEO of APA, Paul Farmer, who also happened to be my boss for some years.  It was very nice to receive that award on behalf of the city.  Because there were concerns about early public release, they didnât let me know until the end of last week that this was even happening.  So I had very little time to let any of you know.  But it was a very nice event.
7.         Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
The Board did not meet this week â no report
BOARD OF APPEALS
281 Turk Street âAppeal of over-the-counter building permit for a pharmacy retail use.  The permit was appealed by neighbors concerned about the proliferation of illegal prescription drug sales.  The Board voted 4 -1 to deny the permit because of potential negative impacts on the neighborhood.  (Person, Goh, Hwang and Fung voted in support of denial; Garcia opposed the vote.)  The Board of Appeals suggested that the neighbors request additional land use controls from the Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors and request additional police presence from the Police Commission.
HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION
The HPC did not meet yesterday â no report
