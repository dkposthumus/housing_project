C.COMMISSIONERSâ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
Commission Comments/Questions
Inquiries/Announcements.  Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
Future Meetings/Agendas.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Antonini:
This isnât necessarily a land use issue, but âhow about those Giants.â  There is nothing like a pennant race that can unite a city.  I think there is a lot of interest out there.  Iâm old enough to remember the pennant races of â59, â62 and â71 â two of which we were successful and one of which we werenât. But it is a lot of fun, and it goes on every day.
Commissioner Miguel:
Iâd like to mention that Iâve met with both sides regarding the Lloyd Street matter.  I attended briefly an open house that CPMC held for the general public at Geary and Van Ness last Sunday; and last evening at Carey and Company with Commissioner Sugaya, there was a Reception for the new Executive Director of the San Francisco Architectural Heritage, Mark Buhler.  I was pleased to meet him.  He will be performing a very important service here in San Francisco.
The other thing Iâd like to mention is during the break I was in New York city, Manhattan, visiting family, and took the opportunity to spend some time taking a look at their process of turning some streets into parks and plazas; into the re-routing of traffic; into the installation of bike lanes to a much greater sense than they had before; and talked to a lot of New Yorkers in different capacities.  It seems pretty good for tourists.  It seems fairly good for pedestrians.  It is impossible for cab drivers, which is a major transit use in New York City, and the biggest consternation is the fact that elimination of vehicle lanes does not stop the constant double parking for loading and un-loading of commercial vehicles.  Along Broadway there are deliveries from 2:00 in the morning until 2:00 the next morning.  It ties up traffic.  Itâs a very interesting experiment.  The plazas are well used; the bike lands are much more used; there seems to be a lot more bikers.  But it is an interesting experiment to watch it there and possibly learn from it here.  If you get back to New York, take a good look at it.
Commissioner Antonini:
I just want to add that I have met with project sponsors on Lloyd and spoke with a couple of the DR requestors in regard to that project.
6.         Directorâs Announcements
Director Rahaim:
The only announcement I have is to welcome you back from the Summer Hiatus, although we did have a short meeting in there along the way.  Fall is already hitting with a vengeance.  Your schedules are pretty intense for the next few weeks.  We will do our best to balance your calendars in the coming months.
7.         Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic                    Preservation Commission.
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
Land Use Committee:
The Committee heard anordinance relating in part to TDR in general and in part to a specific parcel at 680 California Street aka Old St. Maryâs Church.The property would be rezoned from Chinatown-Visitor-Retail to C-3-Office and the maps in the General Plan would be changed to reflect this.  The Planning Code amendment would add a clause that any individual landmark located in the C-3 districts could transfer their TDR rights to any property in the C-3 district â except for Redevelopment controlled areas.  Currently these are restricted within like zoning districts.  It would also add a clause that would require a property owner (who sells the TDR) to use the money to cure any outstanding city violations and/or severe maintenance issues and provide the Zoning kAdministrator with a maintenance plan for the upkeep of the building.  The HPC considered the ordinance on June 2ndand recommended approval.  This commission considered the ordinance on June 20thand recommended approval.This Monday, Board President Chiu and supervisor Maxwell signed on as co-sponsors and the Committee voted to recommend approval to the full Board.
Full Board of Supervisors:
Castro Street NCDâ This week the Board finally passed the ordinance that requires CU for most restaurants and would designate specialty food establishments as âpermittedâ and would delete a provision that allows certain Fast Food establishments on one parcel.  Commissioners you also unanimously recommended approval of this.
The Board gave the city authorization to apply for a grant focusing on the Greening and Storm Water Features for the Cesar Chavez Street Redesign Project âThe grant that we are applying for is worth approximately $1 million in planning funds.  This year the Department has been extremely successful in augmenting our budget with grant funding and work orders from other agencies.  In addition to this outstanding grant, the Department has applied for and received funding for more than $4 million in grant and work order funding.
Development Stimulus Part II âCommissioners you considered two resolutions under the title âDevelopment Stimulus Part IIâ on July 22nd.  The first resolution would establish an area plan infrastructure finance committee to study IFDs and supervise the formation of one IFD in Rincon Hill.  The other resolution would authorize the establishment of future Community Facility Districts.  At your July 22ndhearing you recommended approval of both with additional modifications and considerations.  To date, only the Maxwell resolution that would establish the committee to study IFDs and supervise the Rincon IFD has been considered at the Board.  On this item, you recommended that 1) the Board seek additional funding to extend the pilot program beyond Rincon Hill; and 2) that the committee study the long-term effect on the General Fund of earmarking monies with IFDs for specific areas.At Committee, supervisor Maxwell did add language stating that the Committee should analyze potential fiscal impacts on the General Fund.  With that and some other modifications, the Committee recommended approval to the full Board.This week the full Board adopted the resolution on the first and only read.
Appeals:
CEQA Appeal on 935-965 Market Street â City Place:The Planning Commission approved the EIR and associated project on August 31.  The project consists of demolition of the three structures and construction of a five-story, value-based retail shopping center, one below-grade level of retail, and a two-level below-grade parking garage with 188 parking spaces.  The appellantâs primary issues were the traffic/pedestrian impacts, preservation of the theater, and project design.  Prior to the hearing, the project developer had agreed to provide additional funding @ 20 cents per vehicle for pedestrian improvements in the area and to work with the Department on revising the design.At the hearing, the Board of Supervisors voted 9-0 to uphold the EIR.
3150 California Street âPet Food Express:  This was a Conditional Use appeal authorized by 5 members of the Board.  The planning Commission approved a CU on July 8thto allow formula retail to locate in an existing 1940âs mall.  The appellantâs primary concern was potential disruption to independent pet stores within a t mile radius.  There were two votes on the appeal.  The initial vote to approve this commissionâs decision failed on a vote of 4-7.  The Board would have needed 6 votes to uphold the Commissionâs decision and would need 8 votes to overturn that decision.  Not having enough votes to either uphold the CU or to overturn the CU, the Board voted unanimously to table the item.By tabling the appeal, the Planning Commission decision to approve the CU stands.
Introductions:
Mayor Newsomintroduced an ordinance that would establish the Cityâs Open Data policy and require City departments to make appropriate data available to the public.  It would amend the San Francisco Administrative Code to add Section 22D.
Supervisor Elsberndintroduced a resolution approving an agreement and authorizing the Director of Planning to execute the agreement to ensure the construction on-site of 26 inclusionary units in the mixed-use development proposed at 1150 Ocean Avenue.

BOARD OF APPEALS
Nothing to report this week, but Acting Zoning Administrator Scott Sanchez asked me to report that last week staff members Kate Conner and Ben Fu did an excellent job defending a variance for 48 Newton.
HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION
The HPC met yesterday.  One of the items they discussed was the proposal for the ADA compliant ramp for the Board of Supervisorâs Chambers.  They unanimously approved the proposal.  They also discussed Articles 10 & 11.  As part of that discussion, Tara Sullivan of staff asked them to consider additional special hearing dates to continue those discussions without impacting their regular calendars.  In addition to the joint hearing with you on 10/21, they decided they would rather have one day-long session to complete the task.
SPEAKERS:
Ray Hartzâ commented on Supervisor Mirkarimiâs (Mayor Newsom) Open Data policy.  This is particularly important because it allows people who otherwise could not attend the meetings to get information about the items on the agenda; On the ADA ramp for the Board of Supervisorâs Chambers, the presenter failed to note that the current ramp was installed without permits.
