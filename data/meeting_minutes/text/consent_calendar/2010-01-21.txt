·Future Meetings/Agendas. At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Moore:
I attended a press conference held by Chief Gascon in the Northern Station to disclose the Departmentâs moves relative to prostitution and criminal activities in the Mid-Polk neighborhood. The meeting was attended by District Attorney, Kamala Harris, Supervisor Chiu, and the entire senior staff of the Police Department. After I heard the presentation, I felt quite strongly that it would be of advantage to us to have a land use and public safety discussion with some of the commanders in the different districts to have our own decisions relative to land use decisions being more informed. Since many of these decisions come to us in a very fragmented manner I can understand that we donât always have the full set of other arguments. I personally would appreciate that the commissioners agree to schedule such a meeting and really get a more positive discussion about the correlation between land use and public safety. I encourage and ask your support to have such a meeting and put on our Action Item.
Commissioner Antonini:
I too would be very supportive of that because I think there is a nexus between public safety issues and land use decisions and I think we can go a long ways towards helping with that by some of the decisions we make in the future and some of our policies.
Commissioner Moore:
Iâm not finished. I was just looking for support.
Commissioner Olague:
In relation to your request, my only request would be that we some representatives from citizens groups who represent sex workers or other organizations â that type of thing. I want it to be a balanced discussion where weâre not just getting one perspective but a full community perspective of the issues.
Commissioner Moore:
We have spent a lot of time in the last three or four weeks preparing for an item on our calendar today which has been continued. Iâd like to bring to whoeverâs attention that the architect set of drawings I was working with was very difficult to read. There is a convention among architects to put the north arrow in the upper side of the page. In this particular set â and I understand why 11 x 17 is a difficult format â this has been turned around and upside down, and with no street names on the perimeter of the block, it is very difficult to understand the set. I ask that this be considered even if the drawings are given to us in a smaller format, I would like to see a consistent depiction of the site and the context in which this project occurs [555 Washington].
The last point Iâd like to make â this was a very positive and upbeat meeting â the other night I wandered into the SPUR lobby just as a meeting was starting and I crashed the meeting. Their meeting was on the interim use of C-3 large vacant parcels, some of which we have identified as being close to eyesores, dilapidation and places of unsafe and unsightly activity. There was a group of young architects (Rebar) whose work youâve seen. They came forward with larger ideas for these large parcels. They will be continuing to discuss this at SPUR and I think it would be exciting to have a presentation. It was a very illuminating discussion.
Commissioner Antonini:
The Director can take this up if he so chooses, but we have had questions from the public about the continuance of 555 Washington Street, which as I understand it we have no control over because Rec and Park has canceled the joint meeting and with their joint meeting, we canât meet.
Also, among the many comments and responses we received in relation to the Candlestick Point Hunters Point Shipyard project, there is a letter from the National Football League supporting it and basically asking that the infrastructure improvements â they are very much in support of those. Iâd like to see if I could get a copy of that earlier than the release to the Response to Comments document. Iâd like to see that.
Commissioner Olague:
In the Mayorâs Address to the City he mentioned Market Street (Mid-Market). At some point â I made the request at previous hearings about wanting to here some kind of overall sense of what the Planning Department has in mind for that area and maybe you could include the Mayorâs comments. I want to know how they relate to what we discussed in the past.
Commissioner Sugaya:
On that note I have a procedural question: Commissioner Olague just requested something. Do we have to second it six times before it â¦?
Director Rahaim:
It is helpful for us and I think you have your own policy that more than one commissioner weigh in so that we can be sure that there is consensus that we should work on something.
Commissioner Sugaya:
On that note, I agree with Commissioner Olague and with Commissioner Moore.
I note that in last Fridayâs paper, the School Board has some new rules, one of which is starting meetings on time. Iâd just like to put that into the hopper for 2010.
Commissioner Miguel:
I would like to second Commissioner Mooreâs request and the others that were made. I think we will have time for them and they are areas that come up constantly on individual agenda items to this commission. I think it is better for us if we have overall view of these particular pictures before we start doing it piecemeal, particularly public safety and those types of areas because what happens in one particular neighborhood either overlaps with or pushes out into an adjoining neighborhood. Itâs not just one problem. I think having a better overall view is much better for this commission.
Last Friday I had the pleasure of being a panelist in Berkeley at the Bay Area Social Equity Caucus on SB-375 â the interface between housing and transportation. It was quite interesting; an excellent group of people over there; and I was able to give a little different perspective because of what we have been doing in San Francisco and contrasting that with many representatives from the more suburban and even rural areas. It ended up in a very good discussion.
11. Directorâs Announcements
Director Rahaim:
I was going to bring up the continuance of 555 Washington. I want to be clear; the decision to continue was mine. Rec and Park canceled their meeting at my request. It is because there were a number of delays in getting materials to you and to the public and because of some inaccuracies in the reports. For that reason I felt it was important that we move this.
I think I mentioned last week: there are two upcoming public meetings on our Discretionary Review Reform. One is January 27 and the other is February 2nd. They are both at the Department at 6 p.m. The public is welcome and commissioners as well.
We are looking at Mid Market at the Mayorâs request. He announced it. We are looking at the previous [Redevelopment] Plan that had been adopted by this commission but was not adopted by the Board [of Supervisors]. We are looking to see how that should change; what the environmental review process needs to be â we are kind of re-scoping it to see what needs to be done to see if we want to bring a new Redevelopment Plan forward or not. We are just in the very early stages right now. Iâm happy to give you a memo in more detail as we scope out what we are doing in the future. The interesting thing about Mid Market is that many of the sites that had been identified in the Redevelopment Plan have entitled projects on them now. So it is a different landscape than it was.
Commissioner Olague:
I think we actually voted here for a hearing on this subject as a commission. We voted for a hearing where we discuss the vision that the Planning Department and the city has for Market Street including Yerba Buena. It was prompted by ..â¦ Commissioner Moore requested this about a year ago. Weâve all requested to have a more comprehensive look at what the city is thinking in terms of the entire area of Market Street. I donât think a memo would be sufficient. We actually wanted a hearing.
Director Rahaim:
We will get something organized. Relative to SB-375 and the region, I will be sitting in on a CEO level regional advisory panel that ABAG is organizing with MTC on the implementation of SB-375. We havenât had a meeting yet, but I think the first meeting will be in the first quarter of this year. I will be participating on a regular basis. As we talked about here, I think it is very important for the city to participate in these matters. As youâll see in our budget discussion today, we have allocated some staff time to work on this as well.
