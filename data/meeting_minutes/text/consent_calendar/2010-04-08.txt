C.COMMISSIONERSâ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
5.         Commission Comments/Questions
Inquiries/Announcements.  Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
Future Meetings/Agendas.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Antonini:
Thanked Mr. Peter Albert and others from the City Family and a representative from a Sports Field firm for their participation in the site visits to possible sports sites.  He is happy to report that it is possible to do fields that could be duel use for parking and athletic activities.  The representative is interested in possibly doing a trial field.  It could be natural grass, or artificial, or a combination of both.  This might be something that has application there for a future 49er stadium and other uses throughout the city.
At the same time I was in touch with Nannie Turrell, who was involved in the India Basin development.  That is a separate environmental report from the Candlestick Point/Hunters Point area and it is moving forward too.  I was not able to attend the meeting last night, but I did speak to a number of the neighborhood leaders who are very supportive of the concept of having a bridge that might connect the area from Cargo Street across to what is called the Alcosta site to possibly avoiding a lot of traffic impact on Innes area which is somewhat constricted.
Finally, in regards to 555 Washington, in talking to the project sponsor, it is my understanding that there is no problem over the funds that are in question.  There had been a payment made at the preliminary study â there never was one.  Itâs a question of whether to apply this to the EIR or not.  I was assured by the project sponsor that there is no interest at all in walking away from this and they would certainly pay it if it is decided.  I am also in receipt of a letter asking that the appeal be continued.  Perhaps things could be worked out on some of these issues.
Commissioner Olague:
A while ago I asked for a hearing and most commissioners agreed on what the city is planning for Market Street and the area around Market Street.  I work in that area so I walk there daily and it just seems to be an area in transformation and Iâd like to have some more information as to whatâs going on.  I hear that mid-Market might be revised.  I donât know if Redevelopment is still involved.  There is Yerba Buena.   There is a project weâre looking at between 5thand 6thon Market.  So I would like to schedule that hearing if we can sooner than later.
Director Rahaim:
Weâll schedule something on that probably in about a month â early to mid May.  The difficulty is that there is not much going on.
Commissioner Olague:
Even if there is not much going on, maybe we can just have a discussion and maybe some creative ideas on the transformation of that area; and what is going on in that area; Iâm curious whatâs going on with Yerba Buena even.
Commissioner Lee:
Iâd like to publicly acknowledge Director Rahaim.  Last Friday I met with the top aide to Commissioner in Bangalore, which is our sister city.  He indicated to us that he was impressed with your presentation on what San Francisco is doing.  Bangalore just expanded and they have major infrastructure planning, land use, environmental, energy use [concerns].  And I thought it was important that someone that had never met you before the conference in Honolulu, but heard your presentation there and had a side conversation with you and then on Friday I met with them with other members of the sister city from Bangalore and they were very impressed with what you had to say.  He hopes you can visit Bangalore and give the same presentation you gave in Honolulu to them.
Commissioner Miguel:
During the past week I met with people interested in projects on Ord Street, Lombard Street, Taraval Street and some others as well as attending a noon forum at SPUR today on what could be done with large empty spaces in San Francisco.
6.         Directorâs Announcements
Director Rahaim:
I had the good fortune of attending a seminar at the East West Center in Honolulu last week.  As you know the East West Center is a center devoted to promoting cooperations between Asian countries and the U.S.  There were some very interesting participants from Bangalore and various other countries.  There were four American planning directors besides myself, and a variety of experts, including academics, the World Bank, Community Development organizations, and the Urban Land Institute.  There was a very interesting discussion about the affects of globalization on cities in the world.  If I had to say if there was one theme that ran across the three-day session, it was the issue of regionalism and how all of the cities in these areas are struggling with that same problem as we are â of central cities being part of a larger region and the difficulty of governing  and moving forward with their agendas.  It was a very rewarding three days â not relaxing, but rewarding.
The fifth workshop of the Mission Public Realm plan is next Wednesday, April 14 at 6 p.m., at the Womenâs Building.  This is the fifth in a series.  On April 19that 6 p.m. at the Department is the Eastern Neighborhoods monthly meeting of the CAC.  Those are both on the calendar of our home page of the Departmentâs web page with links to those particular items.
Finally, I will be attending the American Planning Association conference starting Saturday in New Orleans.  I will be participating in an all day session on Saturday, training new planning directors â I guess Iâm an old planning director; and Iâll participate in a couple of other sessions as well.  I will return to the office on Wednesday.
Commissioner Sugaya requested that minutes from CAC meetings be forwarded to commissioners.
7.         Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS
Land Use Committee:
Comprehensive Street Frontage Controls and the Landscaping Ordinancewere held over for a re-hearing because they were amended last week.  There were no changes this week and they were forwarded to the full Board.
Eastern Neighborhoods âThe Committee heard the same presentation you heard last week.  No action was taken.
Fee Reform and Fee Deferral âThe set of three ordinances are sponsored by the Mayorâs Office.  All 12 of your recommendations have been incorporated into the legislation.  There have been no further changes as of yet.  Supervisor Maxwell stated that she wanted to see two things before she could give her support:  1) assurance that there are no delays to the provision of infrastructure due to any fee deferral; and 2) she wants the establishment of a seed fund that would help enable the infrastructure planning during the deferral period.The hearing concluded without action and Chair Maxwell indicated that she would bring the items back on April 19 or later.
Full Board of Supervisors:
Supervisor Chiuâs Parking Requirements for Garage Instillations âThis was the final adoption action this week.  It has completed the Board action.  It retains the off-street parking minimum/maximum SUD, the curb-cut bans and restrictions in Chinatown alleys and other streets.
Integration of the Results of the Market & Octavia Historic Resource Survey     Zoning Map Amendment âthe ordinance would make height changes along Market Street between Noe and Church.  The Board made one change from when your heard this.  They lowered the height on one parcel near the Noe/Market Street intersection to 55 feet.With that, the amended ordinance was passed on a first read
The Green Landscaping Ordinanceâ You heard this on February 18 and made three modifications.  Two of those modifications were incorporated along with one recommendation from the Urban Forestry Council who recommended that trees that are required in parking lots be a species that could be expected to shade 50% of the parking lot in 15 years.With those amendments, the Board approved it at first reading.
Introductions:
Supervisor Dufty introduced an ordinance that would amend the Planning Code to allow new full-service in small self-service restaurants in the Castro area with a CU.  It would also permit self-service specialty food establishments as-of-right, and prohibit all fast-food establishments
BOARD OF APPEALS:
There was no hearing this week.
Historic Preservation Commission:
Two hearings ago the HPC had before them theMission Dolores Neighborhood Association Survey.  The Commission went against the staff recommendation and adopted the survey that was proposed by the consultants for the Neighborhood Association with some modifications.  The motion was so different from what staff had proposed that staff put it back on their calendar yesterday so the Commission could review the [new] draft motion.  I mention this only because of the danger of doing so because [with the new draft motion before them] there was the temptation to change the motion after the fact.  They could only amend the motion if the motion before them did not include everything they had put in it.  Some of the members of the public also wanted amendments/changes [that had not been included in the original motion].  It is very important that the Commission [and the public] be aware that the Commission could only amend the draft motion to include the actions they took at the original hearing.
Soccer Fields at Golden Gate Parkâ Staff from the Recreation and Park Department gave an informational presentation and there was no Commission action.  The Commission directed that the matter come back at the next meeting for their possible action.
