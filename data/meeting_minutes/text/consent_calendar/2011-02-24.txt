C.COMMISSIONERSâ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
5.         Commission Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements.  Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Moore:  I want to bring to the Commissionâs attention an exhibit at SPUR which is the Ocean Beach and Context â a follow up to the charrette they had.  It is a very worthwhile exhibit.  I had somebody take me through it.  The exhibit will be on until March 8th.  It asks comprehensive questions.  It poses questions.  It actually lays out the inter-agency requirements which are necessary to even look at this particular problem.  I was quite impressed by the presentation and the issues raised.
Commissioner Borden:  I was at an all-day forum on Tuesday about disaster resilience and community sustainability and I heard a gentleman speak from the Salvation Army about work that they are doing there in New Orleans related to rebuilding housing for people at the bottom of the economic spectrum.  What was really fascinating is that they have this whole green program for people at the bottom of the economic spectrum and what they did was they did a competition and they sent our RFPs to architects all over the country and they said that they want you to build an 800 square foot unit for $100,000.  People said it couldnât be done.  They had 15 firms from around the world who came up with ideas.  Architecture for Humanity, which is headquartered locally, did a really great job.  Now what they have is these plans on the shelves so when they are looking at redevelopment in some of these poorer neighborhoods, these are the plans that they are using and the Salvation Army helped leverage that with funding that had gotten from people to help provide money to build this housing.  Now granted, I donât think we can build $100,000 homes in San Francisco, but I thought it was really innovative because not only did they marry this idea with having plans on the shelf that were possible and people could use in moving forward with this, but they also coupled it with giving people these green gift baskets.  People got a basket of all the different kinds of improvements that they could put into their homes so they could save money on their heating, and on their water, and all their different bills, and it made a big difference.  These were people who were at the edge anyway housing wise, and to have a new unit could be cost prohibitive if the cost had gone up.  So marrying the new unit with all the environmental sustainability really meant the difference about these people being able to afford their homes.  I would really love to have the gentleman from the Salvation Army who worked on that program talk to us about it.  I thought it was a really innovative approach to taking green, looking at the other end of the spectrum, and also being prepared in the sense of when you are doing redevelopment of housing for people who are at the lower end of the spectrum â how do you make sure that you build housing that they can afford to live in going forward.
Commissioner Miguel:  I came across â actually a friend sent it to me â a web blog from an organization called Fast Company that I had never seen before.  It was very interesting because they were talking about Wal-Mart and Target opening small foot-print outposts, and they were talking about San Francisco.  I hope they were talking about the general San Francisco Bay Area because they were talking about opening two dozen micro-stores in San Francisco.  Often when people who are not that familiar with San Francisco use the term San Francisco for the Greater Bay Area.  Perhaps that is true.  I havenât heard anything.  We know about Targetâs two stores, but nothing about Wal-Mart.
I also have been at meetings this last week on the T-line extension to Chinatown with a lot of controversy around it still,  and a very interesting meeting on something that will be coming to us in the near future, which is Executive Park.
Commissioner Antonini:  I too had some meetings in the last few weeks that I should mention.  Yesterday I met with project sponsors for Treasure Island development; last week with a DR requestor for a future project that will be coming forward on Edgewood Drive; and about a month ago for a project we will see today at 2509 Bush which will stretch the imagination; yesterday, 2750 Mission, which will be next week; and then some neighbors concerns about the development at 800 Presidio; and finally about two weeks ago I met with a representative about a future development at the Dagget Triangle.
6.         Directorâs Announcements
Director Rahaim:  I think I forwarded to you an email about the latest activities regarding the Redevelopment Agency - a proposal by the Governor.  Our Redevelopment Agency Director, Fred Blackwell, has been meeting with other Redevelopment Agencies and has proposed an alternative to the Governorâs proposal.  That discussion was to happen I believe today or yesterday.  We will see the results of that shortly hopefully.
Secondly, I just want to announce a couple of changes to our legislative staff.  As you know, AnMarie heads up that work.  To help AnMarie we made some changes on who is staffing legislative analysis.  Instead of having one position, we will have it broken up into three different positions.  You will see Sophie Hayward, Aaron Starr, and Erika Lovejoy who will be taking part of the responsibilities for that work.  Part of their time will be spent on their normal duties in Neighborhood Planning or on MEA work and the other part will be focused on legislative work.
