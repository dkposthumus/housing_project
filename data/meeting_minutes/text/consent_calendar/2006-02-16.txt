IONIN: (415) 558-6309)883-899 VALENCIA STREET - Assessor's Block 3596, Lot 113 - Request under Planning Code Section 726.56 for temporary parking on an open lot.  The Proposal is to continue operating a parking lot on a vacated gas station.  The lot would provide 22 total parking spaces (one handicap space, two standard spaces approximately 8'x20' each, and 19 compact spaces approximately 8'x16' each).  This open-air parking lot is projected to exist only as long as it takes for the owner to gain approval of demolition and new construction permits (subject to a separate conditional use authorization, Case No. 2004.0891C) to develop a mixed-use structure with commercial on the ground floor and residential above.  The project lies within the Valencia Street Neighborhood Commercial District, the Mission Alcoholic Beverage Special Use Sub-district, and within the 50-X Height and Bulk District.Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions
