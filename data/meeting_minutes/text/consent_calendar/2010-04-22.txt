CRYSTAL SPRINGS/SAN ANDREAS TRANSMISSION UPGRADE PROJECTâCertification of the Final Environmental Impact Report.The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) is proposing the Crystal Springs/San Andreas Transmission Upgrade Project (also known as âCS/SAâ).The project seeks to improve seismic and delivery reliability of the CS/SA Transmission System, and to meet the anticipated requirements of the California Division of Dam Safety (DSOD) for dam facilities in an emergency drawdown scenario. The Project would be located on City and County of San Francisco (CCSFTC "City and County of San Francisco (CCSF" \f A \l "1")-owned lands in unincorporated portions of San Mateo County near the Town of Hillsborough and the cities of San Bruno, Burlingame, San Mateo, and Millbrae. The total proposed project area (including all construction, staging, and access areas) covers approximately 135 acres and is composed of five distinct project components that are oriented southeast to northwest, running approximately 7.6 miles across the Peninsula Watershed.  The primary components of the proposed project would include:
Seismic and functional upgrades to the Upper Crystal Springs Dam Culverts, including seismic strengthening of the Lower Culvert, which crosses the San Andreas Fault rupture zone, and providing isolation capabilities to both culverts.
Seismic improvements to the Crystal Springs Outlet Structures 1 and 2, including removal of the seismically vulnerable aboveground portions of their towers, and construction of a small onshore control shed for remote valve operation.
Major seismic upgrade of the Crystal Springs Pump Station (CS Pump Station), including construction of a new, seismically strengthened Pump Station, and replacement of all related facilities, pipelines, and pipeline connections. The upgrade would also include increasing the pump station booster capability to 120 million gallons per day to meet delivery reliability goals, and construction of a new dissipation structure for releases into San Mateo Creek to meet anticipated DSOD requirements.
Seismic upgrades to the existing CS/SA Pipeline that conveys water from CS Pump Station to San Andreas Reservoir (approximately 4.7 miles), including replacement of two segments of the pipeline, general pipeline improvements, and new access roads to ensure access to the pipeline for emergency and maintenance repairs.
Seismic upgrade to the San Andreas Outlet Structures 2 and 3, including improvements at both the outlet towers and tunnel portals located at the Harry Tracey Water Treatment Plant.
