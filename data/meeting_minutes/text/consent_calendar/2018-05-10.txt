387 ARGUELLO BOULEVARD – northwest corner of Clement Street and Arguello Boulevard; 
Lot 017 in Assessor’s Block 1432 (District 1) - Request for Conditional Use Authorization 
pursuant to Planning Code Sections 303 and 716 to permit change of use from Retail 
Grocery to Retail Grocery and Restaurant Use at an approximately 658 square foot tenant 
space within the Inner Clement Street NCD (Neighborhood Commercial District) Zoning 
District and a 40-X Height and Bulk district. The existing Retail Grocery establishment with 
ABC license type 21 for off-sale general will be retained, and a Restaurant Use will be 
added to the existing tenant space. Conditional Use Authorization would permit on-sale 
beer and wine for operation as a bona fide eating establishment for the newly established 
Restaurant Use, pending approval of ABC license type 41. This project was reviewed under
