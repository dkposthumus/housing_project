Commissioner Borden.
There was this interesting SPUR Smart City Summit meeting they had the other day. There's a new company called MotionLewLoft. They have sensorsand it refers to sensorsthat actually track people and bicycles in addition to cars. They talked about how they're working within the Union Square Business Association and working with businesses to figure out the amount of traffic volume on sidewalks at different time. They are sensor[ing] in 18 different neighborhoods. They don't take pictures of people. They're able to track people and they're able to work with the businesses there so they can see when the different corners or block areas are most crowded so businesses can adjust their hours and they show how maybe one hour later or earlier or a shift in hours for a storethatcould allow them to capture 90% more opportunity because the number of people that pass by. One of the examples that they use, which I thought was really informative to our Better Market Street conversation we had last week, is that, they were working with Show Dogsathat has thesausageBays onplace inthe Mid-Market. They were having a lunch and dinner program and beer. They were promoting it. They were not seeingthedinnerpractice howservicethey had hoped. By counting cars and bicycles - the amount of congestion inthosethesetwo areas was very high. What they found was even though there was a lot of car and bicycle traffic, there wasn't a lot of [people] traffic. The best time for them was the lunch hour shift; they were losing more people because people were waiting in super long lines and not having patience. So now they opened up a place next door that has grab-and-go food in addition to the sausages they have. One of the things they were talking about was helping with economic development and the Mid-Market.  I thought it was fascinating because they can provide [the data] inexpensively because these sensors go over the 3G network. You stick them in a window; they don't require any special permits and they provide insight as to how or where a business should locate, where the traffic is. The entrepreneur was saying he has the business [Inaudible] if their marketing plans were working, so I thought it would be interesting if this company, since they're trying to do more and this being a helpful space, they have sensors in 18 different neighborhoods, they can tell you about various neighborhoods; and I thought it would be interesting because whether we keep cars on Market Street or other neighborhoods; when we're looking at spaces and people are wondering why they're not successful, this kind of insight and information could be useful especially when we're working with the more troubled areas. The other thing I was thinking about the same day when I when I was going to that forum - Dreamforce was taking place and there was a problem in the MUNI tunnel. The traffic was shut down.  On the street, there was grid lock. You could not move. I was on the F line, I was comingtofromCity Hall - going to basically New Montgomery and Mission and I ended up getting out to walk.  I could have walked faster than it would have taken me to go two stops of transit. It made me think about in the America's Cup Conversation: how do we look at transportation planning with regards to events? We're always worried about the transportation and demand related to approving new housing but there's a bigger issue around events that take place in the City and how do we manage if our transit system can't adequately perform? How do we manage that and what type of strategies do we have around those types of events? That day was a disaster on Market Street. It made me scared. I'm glad you brought those two issues up because Fisherman's Wharf is going to implement that.  Are we getting off topic?
Commissioner Antonini:
A couple of items last week: I attended the structure's luncheon at SF Business Times and I thought this was particularly informative because of my presence on the Commission, I was aware of many of the things they were talking about; but I thought the presentations were excellent and very informative.  Then in keeping with what Commissioner Borden was talking about, yeah, the subway on Market Street was very forward thinking when it was built with the MUNI on one level and BART on another, the problem is there isn't redundancy in a lot of places and maybe there's something that can solve some of those problems because if you have a problem, there aren't a lot of places that you will be able to [cross over the cars (?),] but they have a few of those and maybe over a period of  time, they'll be able to clear out disabled vehicles quicker.  I had some meetings: I met with architects and sponsors, I'm not sure of the exact address, [41 Tehama], thank you.  This is a project that will be before us in a couple of months from my understanding.  It is near the Freemont off ramp and it plans to be Oscar Park.  I have had calls from the DR requestor at 1491 Dolores and I will be meeting with them on that as well as the project sponsor; possibly with the DR requester also on considering an addition at Toledo which is continued to the week I believe of October 4 if I'm not mistaken.Commissioner Sugaya:
In the sort of euphoria of tech companies taking up space in San Francisco, there was a cautionary note in the Business Times the other day with respect to the increasing number of subleased spaces that are coming online because of existing companies giving up their spaces in the City.  They said it wasn't at a crisis level or anything like that or even that the sublease market was affecting the regular leasing market, but it was a cautionary note that they were saying after the. Dot Com, the sublease market went up to 45% of the market and right now, I think the number was 14.7 or something like that.
8.         Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
In the written Director’s Report, the item regarding Eco Districts, the Department has been doing some work partially through an EPA grant. I'm looking at the possible structuring of a couple of Eco Districts. There's a workshop happening on October 1 to talk about the ownership issue of the Eco Districts. We established an inter-departmental committee that included the Department of the Environment, SPUC, to talk about how to establish these districts in these neighborhoods and we're excited about the potential there. It has some great possibilities. Secondly, I just wanted to call your attention - and we're able to mention this briefly - that there is new legislation related to the Successor Agency. There was additional State law passed that required us to make changes to the structure that we have set up. The Mayor has proposed legislation that would separate the functions of the fiduciary responsibilities from the other functions that were not quite under State law but were required by the City to take on such as entitlement authority. So the legislation that you'll hear about briefly and that we will follow up with you in a memo about -- we'll explain that in more detail. The State has again added additional responsibilities and has again added some changes to the structure in how we have – how we operate under the successor agency model and it will require two separate boards now, one specifically for the fiduciary responsibility and one for other functions that are more related to entitlement and actions within existing redevelopment areas.  We will be getting you a memo on that in the next week or two.
9.         Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
LAND USE COMMITTEE:
·The Committee held ahearing on the Budget Analyst Report of the Possible Impacts of Formula Retail on Fresh Food Businessat the request of Supervisors Mar and Olague.  This report found that the majority of retail food establishments are non-formula retail.  They analyzed the potential impact of opening a large formula retail store in SF and found that if such a store opened 321 non-formula retail establishments would close representing between up to 1284 lost jobs.  The report suggested three policy options 1) prohibiting formula retail in certain commercial areas; 2) requiring CU in all commercial areas; and 3) keeping the current requirements but add a study of economic impact to the evaluation criteria for formula retail.The Board Committee requested that this report be sent to the Planning Commission and the Budget Analyst staff offered to be available to present the report at your request.
·Supervisor Farrell’s Ordinance toReinstate Liquor License Controls and CU for limited restaurants on Union Streetwas also before the Committee.  The Commission recommended approval of this Ordinance with a minor technical amendment on September 9.On Monday, the Supervisor amended the Ordinance per the Commission request.
FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
INTRODUCTIONS:
BOARD OF APPEALS:
Lafayette Park:As you may know, Lafayette Park in Pacific Heights is currently undergoing a significant renovation. A permit for many of the improvements was appealed and upheld by the Board in August. Last night, the Board heard a Rehearing Request of that appeal. The Appellant presented information that she characterized as being new and – if available at the last hearing – information that would have affected the Board’s decision. DBI, Rec Park and Planning all demonstrated otherwise and the Board unanimously rejected the Rehearing Request. There are additional permits associated with the Lafayette Park project, one of which this same Appellant has already appealed, so the Board will be reviewing this project again in the future.
HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:
A couple of items from yesterday's HPC hearing: the HPC unanimously approved and initiated landmark designation for two individual properties. The first one was 401 Castro Street. It was being considered for designation for its association with the liberties and rights by the LGBT community during the second half of the 20thCentury. Also up for initiation is the Dulger Sales Office Building. The art deco building was the headquarters for the developer Henry Dulger for over 20 years and it is significant for its association, he was a prolific developer but also his role in the transformation to have sunset as well as the building's overall architecture, both properties will be considered in October for a final recommendation by the HPC, once the HPC makes its final recommendation, those will be forwarded to the Board of Supervisors for consideration of landmark status. Finally at yesterday's hearing, the HPC considered the Market Street Discontiguous District. It received its final recommendation and approval from the HPC.  The Planning Commission is scheduled to provide review and comment on this proposed district at today's hearing. Both recommendations will be transmitted to the Board of Supervisors and once we have a hearing date scheduled with the Board of Supervisor, we will let you let you know.
10.2010.0493E(J. NAVARRETE:  575-9040)
THE 34th AMERICA’S CUP PROJECT –Informational Item.The 34th America’s Cup project sponsors—the City and County of San Francisco (CCSF or City) and the America’s Cup Event Authority—are hosting the 34th America’s Cup (AC34) sailing races in San Francisco Bay. A series of AC34 yacht races would be held in San Francisco Bay in 2012 (America’s Cup World Series) and in 2013 (Louis Vuitton Cup, America’s Cup Challenger Series; potential America’s Cup Defender Selection Series; and the Match). Several of the venues proposed for the AC34 events are piers, water areas, and facilities managed by the Port of San Francisco (Port) including piers and water basins/water areas on the northeastern waterfront and Pier 80. The project is being coordinated with the Port's construction of the James R. Herman Cruise Terminal on Piers 27-29, which began construction in early 2012, and the shell and core of the cruise terminal structure is proposed to be used in 2013 as part of the America's Cup Village. Various other venues are proposed for spectatorârelated activities, some of which are under the jurisdiction of other city, state or federal agencies, including Marina Green, Fort Mason, Aquatic Park, Alcatraz Island, San Francisco Civic Center, Union Square, and Justin Herman Plaza.
Most of the facilities required to accommodate the two-year event would be temporary improvements to be removed at the conclusions of the events, although certain permanent infrastructure improvements would be required at some of the proposed venue sites within the Port's jurisdiction. The proposed project also includes a number of implementation plans that address transportation management, waste management, parks coordination and management, sustainability, water and air traffic, public safety, youth involvement, and workforce development.
