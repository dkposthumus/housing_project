235 2ND STREET – east side between Tehama and Clementina Streets; Lot 123 in Assessor’s 
Block 3736 (District 6) – Request for Downtown Project Authorization pursuant to Planning 
Code Section 309 to allow for a reduction in the provision of off-street freight loading 
requirements of the Planning Code, as permitted in Planning Code Section 161(e), and to 
modify Condition of Approval No. 2(E) under Exhibit A of Motion No. 15003 (Case No. 
1999.176X) requiring two off-street freight loading spaces. The proposed project 
(“Project”) would convert the existing, ground-floor freight loading area fronting 
Clementina Street, a portion of the ground-floor parking area fronting Tehama Street, and 
an interior ground floor space previously occupied by a retail use fronting 2nd Street into 
floor area for office use. In total, approximately 9,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area is 
proposed for conversion from accessory freight loading, accessory parking, and retail floor 
areas to office use. Two existing garage doors and adjacent curb cuts would be removed, 
with infill façades to match the building’s existing façades along both street frontages. The 
Project would modify a third (existing) garage door fronting Tehama Street to 
accommodate three new service vehicle loading spaces, replacing two existing freight 
loading spaces. The Project would reduce the number of existing accessory parking spaces 
from 50 to 25 spaces and would add 32 Class 1 bicycle parking spaces. The subject 
property is located within a C-3-O(SD) (Downtown Office, Special Development) Zoning 
District and 200-S and 250-S Height and Bulk Districts. This action constitutes the Approval 
Action for the project for the purposes of CEQA, pursuant to San Francisco Administrative 
Code Section 31.04(h).
