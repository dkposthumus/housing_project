C.COMMISSIONERS’ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
7.         Commission Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements.  Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Antonini:
Once again, we saw some tragic events with the fire on Duboce Street this week. I have made some suggestions in the past, and I probably should take this up with some of the supervisors, and perhaps at least with the planning staff in more detail about some sort of incentives for people with older, seismically structured, allegedly compromised units; to be able to renovate these to bring them up to standard. I have suggested in the past looking at some kind of situation where some sort of trade may be possible with newer units that have fewer of these challenges, and are probably less expensive to maintain and, certainly do not need the amount of maintenance that the older units do. There may be a way to do some kind of trade to make newer units permanently affordable and rent controlled in exchange for allowing the older units to be able to change their configuration (sell them, rent them), but I think it would be a net benefit for the City to have affordable units in safer conditions.  And units that are older and compromised would be made safer.  It might be a system that could be worked out with details obviously, but something along these lines. I think he will continue to see these problems, and these are mostly historic types of structures that under our current policies are not slated for demolition, and shouldn't be. They do need to be retrofitted in a number of different ways. This is a thought I had and I will try to explore this in the near future.
Commissioner Miguel:
Ms. Avery, I would like to close the meeting today in memory of Jon Bulkley. He was an architect based out of San Francisco, although he worked in a number of States. He was a longtime former Board member, and still to this day he died while on the SPUR Advisory Board.  In 1970, he was one of the founding members of the Planning Association for the Richmond. He appeared before this body many times.
Commissioner Moore:
I read an article today in the San Francisco Business Times, which I find a little bit amazing. There are 68 Walgreen's in the 49 square miles of this City. I would like to see what the stats are. I figured out that for every three-quarter square-miles there is one Walgreen's.  That does not speak very well to help the city at all. I think it means that everybody literally is within 500 ft., on average of a Walgreen's. In looking at other similar types of businesses moving in, we might want to take a closer look within our Planning Department where the deficiencies are. I do see an increased number of businesses taking a space in the business district and I find it a very dull and boring phenomena.
This morning there was a very interesting article that I strongly recommend the planning department and everyone read. There was a study released on industrial employment in the bay region. It talked about manufacturing and industrial employment in the U.S., with a focus on the Bay Area. There was a noticed increase in manufacturing in San Jose, and a slight decrease in San Francisco. When I looked at the wages for industrial workers, food, pharmaceutical, and electronic manufacturing were very high. They were in the $90,000 or $106,000 annual wage category, which I think is a factor to look at when we want to stabilize our employment bases. I look to the Department to perhaps look at industrial zoning, which is now PDR, so that we can be prepared to find space for those types of employment opportunities when they arise. I think the article would be great for the rest of the commissioners and I can provide a link.
Commissioner Borden:
There was another article talking about Fillmore Street and how it has become one of the hottest, upscalemeatclothingmarket streets in the Country. The rental prices for retail there have gone through the roof as a consequence.  And a lot of international brands are clamoring to get there sooner so they don' t meet the 11th formula retail [store]. It has actually caused a run on real-estate there, which has been interesting to see the effect that is taking place.
Commissioner Antonini:
A couple of things I should have brought-up earlier: the first is that I had a meeting with the Sponsors about a couple of projects coming to us in their future. One was [an end Hillcrest Line], and one is in the Richmond District on Geary Street, which will eventually be a demolition and new construction, which could be a dental office from what I understand.
And finally, another thing that I thought was quite important and interesting was on the subject of family flight, which is something that we deal with.  There was an article in yesterday's paper, or the day before, about parents taking over the failing Daniel Webster School to help the area. It talks about how successful they were and how they have produced a good school that is sought after and diverse by nature. But the key was that for all eight of these families, their children were allowed to attend their neighborhood school, which was this particular school. I saw this interesting article and it might perhaps be the key to help us in the future to improve the quality of our education system in San Francisco. This is a great example that could be utilized in all parts of the City, hopefully.
