0302 (District 3) – Request for a Conditional Use Authorization, pursuant to Planning Code 
Sections 209.3 and 303 to construct a health spa (d.b.a. “Alchemy Springs”) at the 
basement level of the existing commercial building, located within a RC-4 (Residential-
Commercial, High Density) Zoning District and 80-T height and bulk district. 
Approximately 2,706 square feet of the new health spa use will be located inside the 
5,750-square-foot basement level of the existing building and is considered a principally 
permitted Personal Services retail sales and service use. The 2,455-square-foot outdoor 
portion of the project would encompass the entire rear yard and is classified as an Outdoor 
Activity Area, which requires a conditional use authorization when not located at the front 
of the lot within a RC-4 zoning district. This project was reviewed under the Community 
Business Priority Processing Program (CB3P). The Planning Department found that the 
project is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act. The Commission’s action 
constitutes the Approval Action for the project for the purposes of CEQA, pursuant to San 
Francisco Administrative Code Section 31.04(h).
