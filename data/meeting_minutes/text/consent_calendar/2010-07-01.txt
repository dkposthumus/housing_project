Commissioner Antonini:
-  A couple of things. I noticed today that there is a proposal that's being considered for development and we aren't supposed to comment on the viability, but I thought it was good to be aware of this one, because what we always deal with is making San Francisco as family-friendly as possible and I am happy to hear that a group is working on a school's measure and talking about neighborhood schools. It is good people are aware of this, because in addition to the cost of housing and the available of the types of housing, the thing we hear most often are schools, so that's a move in the right direction.- Last week we closed our meeting in memory of Jo Costello, a young lady on the crew team at U.C. Berkeley and died at the age of 22 what she did in addition to graduating from Cal, made the public aware of lung cancer which kills more than all the other cancers in America, and surprisingly a considerable percentage of people who contract this disease are nonsmokers and people who are not exposed to any environment that would support that kind of thing. She took it upon herself to become a spokesperson for this and that's a wonderful thing.
- They are having an event September 12th, at Golden Gate Park and I think it's great that the public is aware of it and the fact that we haven't really improved the life expectancy for people who have contracted lung cancer in the past 18 years, it's still only 18%, and this is an area where we have to focus on a cure or better treatment options.
Vice President Olague:
- I want to congratulate Commissioner Sugaya and Commissioner Moore, and request that we close the hearing today in memory of Rene Caravaning who worked on issues such as affordable housing. If it weren't for people like him working quietly behind the scenes, then the City wouldn't be as diverse economically and racially so, I just wanted to thank him for his work and close the meeting in his honor. He worked with people like Calvin Welsh and Sue Hestor, that whole group that have worked so hard for keeping those values.
Commissioner Sugaya:
-  It' is been a while since some of the news became public respect to Planning Department staff. Must have been -- I don't know how many months ago, or a month ago, at least, and then more recently, there's rumors about another staff being let go. I would like to ask for a closed session with the Director so that the Planning Commission can be informed as far as what -- within the limits of human resources, and other city regulations, not after information about specific staff people, I would just like to know in more general terms, the status of the department and plans for positions, like the Zoning Administrator, so it's not a witch-hunt and there are strict limits, I know on what can be talked about anyway, within those guidelines if there's interest on the Commission.
Commission Secretary:
- Commissioner before any other Commissioners weigh in, which the subject is not on your which the subject is not on your calendar, I might point out, but I would just -- if you would give me an opportunity to talk with the City Attorney.
- I know closed sessions on personnel issues are pretty much restricted to the hiring, firing and performance evaluation of myself as your Commission Secretary and the director of planning and would not extend to other members of the Planning Department, so let us have a chance to discuss before we say yea or nay on your request.
President Miguel:
-  I also would very much like to congratulate Commissioner Moore and Commissioner Sugaya on their reappointment to another four-year term on this Commission, very aptly deserved. It will be my pleasure to continue to serve with them at least for the next two years of my term. I would like to mention something, an insert that was in the San Franciscoâs Business Times last week, entitled San Franciscoâs Structures It goes into such things as the problems of housing, instead of cobbling together the financing for low income house, but the center of it has some very interesting statistics, what is in under construction approved, and in planning in San Francisco's office and research development pipeline, as well as residential development pipeline, maps, other things, and the entire insert is well worth getting your hands on, if you haven't seen it.
- It was an excellent production by them, been aware they were putting this out, and I can't vouch to the absolute accuracy of all their statistics in there. Just in general they usually do a pretty good job of putting everything into current numbers. So if anyone hasn't seen it, you might enjoy it.
Commissioner Sugaya:
-  I found it fascinating because it's not just a lip, it's on maps of the City and Downtown and South of Market, etcetera. There's also an interesting article in that issue about the Historic Preservation Commission and it is a fairly positive, I would say article and kind of says a lot of the fears people had when proposition J had with respect to the powers of the Commission and their ability or what they thought would be a Commission holding up projects, hasn't materialized, and there was a nice quote from the source over blowed shares, and the people sponsoring 150 Otis, the veterans housing project saying they had no problems going through the City commission in there review process. I thought it was a nice article.Commissioner Antonini:
- I also noticed that and the Business Times has been doing that structure, what was disturbingto me, the number of projects, both residential and commercial, usually 15 to 20 of them, fiveof one and six of the other.
Commissioner Borden:
- I wanted to recognize Walter Shorestein who passed this passed week who has been a major force in the community and the real estate community. He supported a lot of causes and caused a lot of fights but had an illustrious career as not only a great, you know, business person, but also a person who supported the City.
Commissioner Lee:
- Two weeks ago, San Francisco did an article about UCSF and generated jobs, and also generates more income for the city, about 6-point-some-billion that has to do with Mission Bayand there was an issue about patented last year for the university was zero was previous year they had quite a few patents. That's very important because of the stem cell technology at UCSFhas been able to spin off over 800 corporations, which gives us the economic base that we need to meet the future, and I think one thing about structures I noticed what Commissioner Antonini noticed, we don't have a lot of building. The average person in San Francisco doesn't understand. We don't create jobs. Most of the jobs are union jobs, plus all the entitlements. Whether for affordable housing, daycare or the school district, we don't get that, one day I will talk with Mayor Haas of the San Francisco Time to take a look at what we approve and don't approve, if we don't have any kind of development in the City, we are not going to have a tax base.
