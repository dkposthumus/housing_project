Commissioner Antonini:
Thank you. I would like to 
thank some of the excellent staff members for their excellent work.First, Johnny Jaramillo, for the update on the Downtown Plan, which I think was 
extremely well-done.Some of that has been mentioned in the press, a summary of the findings that 
were in thatreport, and I think that the emphasis on the fact that our downtown area is one 
of the finest in the Country as far as being dense, walk-able, and a well-served 
by transit is very important. I think the only thing I would say, it is not 
negative, but just not to judge our conclusions for the future from what has 
happened in the last 20 to 30 years. The fact that there are fewer professional 
-- or at least the same number of professional managerial type positions and 
corporate jobs in the downtown area, surely that part north of Market does not 
necessarily mean that is going to happen in the future.Because, this is such a great area, we're seeing more and more of the employees 
of Bay Area businesses living in San Francisco, rather in suburban areas, and I 
think that there is becoming an awareness among the leaders of the many of the 
companies, that makes perfect sense for executive functions, government 
relations, and probably some of the work force to be in San Francisco. I think 
we have the perfect opportunity to work on that to the development plan in 
Transbay. I think that the future is bright in that regard, and I think there 
is, hopefully, going to be a resurgence of the percentage of the work force that 
does business in San Francisco. At one time, it was as high as 30%. I think it 
is down to 16%. I think with what we have, the wonderful area we have for 
businesses, there, that is already being built out, you know, it is appropriate 
that we be 25% to 30% of the work force in the Bay Area. The only downside on 
transit in that regard is, and we' re served by Bart from many directions and 
from Caltrain, and unfortunately, because Marin never became part of the Bart 
system, it does not go out to northwestern San Francisco,  in Marin, which is an 
area that has to be analyzed for the future. Finally, I guess there was the 
question about, you know, the metropolitan area. There are mixed opinions as to 
whether San Francisco Bay Area includes the South Bay also. The Census Bureau 
and others consider them two different metropolitan areas, So that does not 
really make too much difference, but it is interesting to look at it, and I 
think we do have to consider it one region, but they certainly are distinct 
areas. Secondly, I want to thank Elizabeth Watty, for a very excellent report, 
answering questions I raised about the Van Ness Special Use District and 
hospital child care information. As our discussion continues on CPMC and on 
housing issues, it is important to have the facts first and make decisions 
second. She has provided us and the Commission with some really interesting and 
important answers to what the Van Ness Plan Special Use District is, and a 
history of all the different entitlements and developments that occurred and the 
relationship to the housing requirement. Certainly, it is pointed out that there 
was one instance where a hotel was demolished and was replaced by housing. There 
have been no instances where anything has been demolished and replaced by large 
institutional use. I think it is quite clear the plan was crafted to make sure 
that there is good land between housing and commercial, especially private, but 
I do not think it speaks to institutional and public serving uses, you know, 
because they should be distinct from the requirement in my opinion that is 
something that is under discussion. It is very interesting. Finally, she did a 
really good job of pointing at the level of charitable contribution for the Cal 
Pacific system, relative to about 12 other hospitals in the bay area. I think it 
is important that everybody read this kind of information and understand, you 
know, where they are relative to the others, which is actually pretty much on 
par with most. Some are higher in child care, and others are lower in child 
care. So it is important to have the facts before we make our decision. I want 
to thank her for a very excellent report, and I hope it is available to the 
public. I am sure it is.
CommissionerMiguel:
I have met with people 
regarding the Eureka Street Project and also the Veterans Affairs Medical Center 
in out on Clement Street. I would like to commend the Department again, the 
Better Streets Plan, which continues to gain recognition. It was just awarded 
the California APA 2011 Best Practices Awards, and it will be presented during 
the California Awards Ceremony in Santa Barbara this September. With that, 
perhaps we will go national with it. As Commissioner Antonini mentioned, the 
information on the Downtown Plan, 25 years of work, was excellent. John 
Jaramillo did a very good article on it. I did appreciate the information on the 
Van Ness Plan, although different Commissioners will interpret things 
differently.
President Olague:
I guess, usually as a little 
small gesture, we sometimes close the meeting in memory ofsomeone who greatly contributed to the city. We're going to be closing the 
meeting today in memory of the Executive Director of the Eviction Defense 
Network, it is quite a loss he was a giant as far as advocating on behalf of 
low-income tenants and renters here in San Francisco. So if we can close in his 
memory that would be appreciated. Also in solidarity with the people of Norway 
who experienced a rough last Friday. Even though we met the day after that, it 
is something that I think we should also be mindful of, that huge loss.
7.         Directorâs 
Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Excuse my tardiness, I was at 
the Board of Supervisors on another matter. I wanted to let you know that the 
Better Streets Plan has received its third award, an award from the American 
Planning Association of the Southern California Area, that will be given to the 
Department in Santa Barbara later this year. That is a project that is getting 
much-deserved recognition. I am very pleased for all the staff involved in and 
all the City Departments that worked so hard on the project.
8.Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of 
Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
LAND USE COMMITTEE:
11008 Inclusionary Alt. 
	for Market & Octavia.This Ordinance would to 
	provide a new land dedication alternative in the Market and Octavia Plan 
	Area in lieu of payment of the Affordable Housing Fee and provides 
	requirements of such land dedication.  (on-site 15%, off-site 20%, fee 20%, 
	new alternative 40%)  Currently, this alternative only exists in the Eastern 
	Neighborhoods.  On June 23, you considered this Ordinance and recommended 
	several modifications that were suggested by a working group.  Supervisor 
	Wiener incorporated all of your suggestions.This week the Committee 
	modified the Ordinance and continued the item[1].
FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
Two of the items on the Land 
Use agenda were sent out for a vote on the following day.  These items were the 
Limited Live Performance Permits and the Inner, Outer Clement and Geary NC 
Controls.
§Limited Live Performance.Commissioners, you heard 
this item on July 7.  This Ordinance would to create a Limited Live Performance 
Permit for indoor locales whose primary function is not presentation of live 
performances.  At that time, you recommended approval with modifications. You 
requested that the Ordinance be amended to extend the opportunity for 
small-scale entertainment to be considered an accessory use in the SOMA, West 
Portal, and Pacific Avenue  districts[2]. 
In addition, you recommended that any restrictions on the visibility of 
entertainment from public rights-of-way be removed, as well as any requirement 
that doors and windows be closed while the accessory performances are underway.  
At last weekâs hearing Supervisor Mirkarimi indicated that he would incorporate 
all of your modifications, except one.  On the request of Supervisor Kim, he has 
amended the Ordinance so that it allows this entertainment use in the SoMa 
Districtsâbut only in the areasnotinvolved in the Western SoMa 
Community Planning Process.  This week at both the LU hearing and the Full 
Board, there was interest in expanding the Ordinance to allow DJs.In the 
end, the Full Board[3]continued the item to August 2nd.
§Inner, Outer Clement and Geary NC Controls.Commissioners, you heard 
this item sponsored by Supervisor Mar on July 14, at that time you recommended 
approval with modifications.  Supervisor Mar amended the Ordinance to include 
your recommendations, except for one.  First you recommended permit one 
additional restaurant in the Inner Clement and then allow additional restaurants 
in both the Inner and Outer Clement by CU.  The Supervisor accommodated this 
request as it still is a relaxation from the existing controls. Second, you 
recommended to remove the prohibition on Formula Retail Pet Supply Stores. 
Although Supervisor Mar did not remove this prohibition, there was discussion of 
this at both the Committee and the Board.After discussion, the Board 
approved Supervisor Marâs Ordinance on first reading.
§BUDGET.This week the Board unanimously passed the Cityâs Budget on FINAL reading.  The 
Mayor then joined the Board hearing and signed the budget into law.
§BF 110277 
Vintage Signs.This 
week the Full Board considered Supervisor Camposâs Ordinance that would allow 
for more types of signs to be covered under the historic sign ordinance.  You 
heard this item on June 2 at which time you recommended approval with 
modifications.   Supervisor Campos incorporated your recommendations into the 
proposed legislation and chose the word âvintageâ to replace the word 
âhistoric.âThe item, as amended, was passed on FINAL reading Tuesday.
§110627 General Plan Amendment - Community Safety Element.This Ordinance added 
language to the Community Safety Element of the General Plan to reference the 
most recent Hazard Mitigation Plan. This amendment ensures the City and County 
of San Francisco will qualify for additional funding enabled through California 
Assembly Bill AB 2140, for certain disaster recovery projects.  This Commission 
had recommended approval of the Ordinance.This week the Board approved the 
Ordinances on FINAL reading.
INTRODUCTIONS:  2 Hearing 
Requests
Board of Appeals:All actions below were made 
	by votes of 4-0. President Goh was excused. In broad terms, none of these 
	cases appear to rise to the level where the Commission would necessarily be 
	interested, although this of course is just one opinionâ¦.
2955 26th Street (E. Jackson).This case involved the Departmentâs disapproval of a building permit to (1) 
remove a longstanding illegal unit and (2) construct an expansion to be used by 
the resulting single-family house. The Department disapproved the permit out of 
deference to a previous Board of Appeals ruling on an earlier proposal to remove 
the illegal unit. In that case, because of the displacement of a low-income 
tenant that would have resulted, the Board disapproved the permit and instructed 
the property owner to seek a parking Variance to allow legalization of the 
unit.  The legalization process was never completed, the unit remained, the 
property changed hands, and the current owner of the building invoked the Ellis 
Act and afforded the displaced tenant relocation benefits. Owing to the changed 
circumstances, the Board felt that the project should go forward. However, 
because Section 311 notification for the project had not taken place (as we 
disapproved the permit, notice wasnât appropriate) the Board allowed our 
disapproval to stand however they waived the otherwise-applicable year-long 
period during which the same building permit could not be re-submitted. In other 
words, they told the applicant to re-submit the same plans and they told us to 
issue the notice and â barring the filing of a DR â to approve the project. 
While the technicalities of this case were highly awkward, the outcome is 
satisfactory.
1138-1140 Page Street (A. 
Starr).This case 
involved the Departmentâs approval of a permit for an expansion of an existing 
residential building, however the real issue was private litigation between the 
parties for which the BoA hearing appeared to be used as leverage. A DR was 
previously filed on this project but a settlement was reached and no hearing was 
conducted. Construction began, however during construction the roof collapsed, 
causing extensive damage to the subject property. Also, (1) structural problems 
were discovered in the Appellantâs adjacent building, (2) tenants in that 
building raised concerns about safety issues and construction noise, and (3) 
there were allegations that the proposal had become a de-facto demolition. The 
Appellant stated that their first desire was to have the building declared an 
unlawful residential demolition, which would effectively preclude the project 
for five years, and their second desire was to have the project appear before 
the Planning Commission as a DR under Section 317. This case, too, was highly 
technical, but after being presented with Planning Code Section 317âs controls 
and DBIâs demolition policies, the Board rejected the appeal and upheld the 
permit, although it did impose a condition relating to hours of construction. 
Here, too, the outcome was satisfactory.
650 2ndStreet (R. 
Sucre).This case 
involved a proposal to construct a stair penthouse, deck, and wind screen on the 
roof of a live/work building which would connect to a top-floor unit. On appeal 
was a Letter of Determination that stated the project would not comply with the 
Planning Code because the building was noncomplying with respect to height â it 
is 73â tall in a 65-X district hence the remaining 2â are inadequate for a stair 
penthouse or wind screen. The appellantâs argument was based on (1) a misreading 
of the 10â height exemption for such features and (2) the fact that â under 
ambiguous circumstances â three other similar penthouse/decks had been 
constructed on the roof of the building. The Board continued the matter until 
August 24 so that we could work with the Appellant to figure out a 
Code-compliant means of getting them access to their proposed roof deck. Itâs 
worth noting that the Board clearly supported our position. This last case, too, 
ended satisfactorily.
