Assessor’s Block 0206 (District 3) – Request to grant a Variance by the Zoning Administrator which will extend

Code: width of openings for off-street parking and loading (Section 155(s)(4)(A)); and active use, ground floor 
ceiling height, and transparency requirements for street frontages in commercial districts (Sections 145.1(c)(3),

reaching a roof height up to 218 feet tall. The Project Site is located within a C-3-O (Downtown Office) Zoning
