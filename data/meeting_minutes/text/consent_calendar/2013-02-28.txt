Commissioner Moore:
On a very positive note, I would like to share with the Commission that I walked byBroderick Street yesterday, Drew, and look at the most stunning example of a vertical garden. Patrick Blanc, you remember a few years ago, not everybody was on the Commission at that time. We approved it with actually not having any precedent in San Francisco and it turned out to be just absolutely beautiful. You should go by there. It is the example of how to do it, if you have the right landscape architect and the right nurseries to provide the type of plants which thrive. It looks fantastic. On another note, my concerns about Chase signage continue. I walked by a very stunning example at the corner of Sutter and Montgomery where I am sure all of us walk, to count 22 Chase signs on the Montgomery and Sutter Street facade.  It's a former location of Charles Schwab which was a very kind of discreetly signed, but highly visibly brokerage firm at the corner, happened to be a San Francisco firm, and with Chase now moving in there are 22 signs, 11 on the outside of the façade, where in every column spacing there is one sign.  So, as the arcade goes on you have a sign per column spacing and then on the inside between lit signage on the storefront you have the blue ATM's and everything else which comes with it. I would like the Department to put that on the list of things to observe. It is very much not what I think we want or what our Code really prescribes. Lastly this morning I read of a wonderful story. We talked about 150 Otis Street the other day, Veteran’s Common. Apparently the 2540 Mission Street building which is the Medjool building with the roof top garden bar was just adapted to accept about 20 -- I'm not quite sure I’m right about the number, vouchers of veteran’s homes units negotiated by former Supervisor Dufty and I think that is a wonderful and positive thing to share with each other. It’s described in today’s paper if anyone wants more detail on that.
Commissioner Antonini:
I read with interest about the story regarding, I think it was the chairperson of Yahoo that ask that employees not work from home anymore and in the future begin having to go to their campus to work. And being in the line of work I am, it's pretty impossible for anyone to work from home so I really can't comment on -- unless they're equipped and want the patients go to their homes. I can't really comment on tech businesses,  however, but it seems to me that in a creative type of atmosphere you would want as much interaction as possible between employees face-to-face and you can multi-task  more and network and do a lot of things that aren't easy to do if you're all at different locations and the other thing I would suggest being a San Francisco resident, and having a business here, would be, as we know many of the employees at a lot of these companies are San Francisco residents and have to commute to the campuses and I think we see the results of these with the buses and other things going through the City, but it might be wise for some of these companies, and I think we're beginning to see more of it, to relocate many of their workforce to San Francisco or their whole operation and it seems to be working well for Salesforce, Yelp, Twitter, Zynga and other companies that are here in San Francisco, and they're starting to find out you don't need the campus. You can have people in properly built vertical environments and still be just as productive as you are in a campus. It is kind of a disadvantage because there is no public transportation. Everyone is sort of locked in there more or less figuratively during the course of the day and probably it’s not as good as it could be, but that is my personal opinion. I'm not making a decision for any of these firms, but makes sense wasting an hour each way a day for everybody to commute to the campus from San Francisco or not everyone, but a significant part of your workforce could be better spent in more productive ways.
