Commissioner Moore:
-  
I would like to ask the Director to briefly take us through his progress report 
on the Academy that is in todayâs commission packet.
- I 
wrote a letter to Scott Sanchez to update us briefly, including the public, or 
share with us regarding the Academyâs shuttle busses â they are totally out of 
control. I am also getting an increasing number of comments from the public 
about this.
- I 
am sure it is being approved under a jurisdiction outside our own, but if this 
institution continues to take the largest bus in its fleet, without having the 
ability to turn the corner easily and clog up major intersections during 
critical hours of downtown traffic, that goes beyond the patience of anybody who 
is moving around the City.
Commissioner Miguel:
-  
It is not on calendar.  We canât have a robust discussion, but I wanted to point 
out that there was a letter we sent to the Academy a couple of weeks ago.  In it 
we outline specifically the enforcement strategy that we intend to pursue with 
the Academy and outlined specific dates for submission of material that they 
have to submit.  If those dates are not met, then we will close the case and 
schedule items for denial.
-  
Part of the enforcement strategy is to focus on any of their properties that 
were purchased after the application was submitted in May 2008.  There were two 
properties, perhaps three that we know of that were purchased and started to be 
used since that date.
-  
Part of the whole analysis with regard to transportation is that we are 
discussing that with them and getting detailed information about how the buses 
run, how much they are used and that sort of thing so we can work it into the 
analysis.
- I 
am chairing monthly meetings with the CEO of the Academy and our staff to make 
sure we keep on schedule and that we are doing what is necessary to move all of 
this forward as well.
Commissioner Antonini:
- 
Many of you watched the opening ceremonies of the Olympics last Friday night and 
saw the shot from above Vancouver. I am sorry to say I have not been up there 
for a long time. When I was there, it was in the 1960âs, it was very flat.  
There were not many tall buildings at all except for a couple of residential 
buildings out by the ocean.  You can see what has happened there.  They have a 
liberal parking allowance for their residential buildings, and they may have 
found a way to build them without casting any shadows.  In any case, maybe we 
should talk to Vancouver a little and see how they are doing it and if they are 
having traffic problems or other kinds of problems.
-  
The other item I wanted to bring up was in regards to CEQA appeals.  As most of 
you know, effective January 1, 2003, the appeals from CEQA decisions were, in my 
understanding, to the Board of Supervisors or to the county in which they are.
-  
I talked a little bit to the City Attorney on this, but it strikes me that San 
Francisco is a unique situation because we are a City and County.
-  
In most instances, and I have been familiar with one particular environmental 
process I follow in another county, there was no appeal to the county Board of 
Supervisors.
-  
It was all held within the City where there was jurisdiction.  It seems to me 
this is a little different situation, because you have with our Board of 
Supervisors, elected officials who are part of the entitlement process 
themselves, whereas Boards of Supervisors in other counties are usually not 
involved in the entitlement unless it happens to be unincorporated land of a 
particular city.  Perhaps the way this is being handled is not proper for San 
Francisco since our situation is different.
Commissioner Borden:
-  
I want to thank all those people who reached out to me for what turned out to be 
an extended leave with their words of concern.
- I 
want to talk about an article in the paper about historic churches or churches 
that are abandoned and what is happening to them.
-  
I know we have seen in the past other churches mentioned, and maybe staff could 
put together a little report on some of these churches.  Some of them are 
already in the Planning Department queue, and some of them are not.
-  
I know there was an extension at the state level related to historic resource, 
but maybe there is something we can do.
-  
I donât know if there is anything we can do locally to kind of help them get tax 
credits through other things.  That would be something great to look into.
-  
The third issue is not really a planning issue.  The Americaâs Cup has come back 
to America, and I would love to put a word out there. I myself have spent a lot 
of time sailing on the bay and have done a bit of racing, and I think it would 
be a great engine for the economy.  A lot of great working-class jobs come with 
the shipping and sailing industry, so I really hope that we put our best foot 
forward to help make that happen and work with the agencies necessary to kind of 
help make that a reality.
Commissioner Olague:
-  
I would like to understand a little bit about the scheduling of the hearings, 
because I will be gone for a week in April, and I want to make sure I am here to 
participate in some of those hearings.
Commissioner Sugaya:
-  
I seem to recall â is there some city action going on with respect to Mid-Market 
planning?
- 
The Mayor has asked us to look at the possibility of rethinking the proposed 
redevelopment plan so we are just starting to look at that.  Are we trying to 
scope out what would be necessary?
-  
Obviously it is a big development area and the preservation issues are really 
important in that corridor as well as looking at how we could help just in 
general revitalize that corridor. I think we went through that before and it 
just kind of skipped my mind.
- I 
was reading Planning magazine the other day on an article about digital 
billboards and messaging signs and those kinds of things are taken under 
consideration as we move forward in the planning effort.
- I 
think with respect to Vancouver, you did have a director from Vancouver, I think 
he said something like it was not quite what people thought it was.  One of the 
questions that I get about Vancouver, and I think I have mentioned this before 
having lived there for many years is  âwhy canât you [San Francisco] be more 
like Vancouver?â and I got a little tired of it.
- 
Finally, my response was it is not the 51ststate.  It is a different 
country.  One of the interesting things, the problem that is happening, is that 
virtually every single high-rise that you see is residential, which is a great 
thing in the sense that they have attracted a huge residential population, 
including families.  The irony is that they have built virtually no commercial 
space in their downtown for 25 years, so they have developed this very odd 
pattern.  Itâs a huge problem with traffic congestion because people are 
actually living in downtown and working in far away areas.
Commissioner Lee:
-I am actually aware that since they have a different form of government 
there, in the middle of actually figuring out who owns all of this residential, 
I think I mentioned to you in a private conversation because they are getting 
concerned that too many people with second homes who really do not contribute to 
the day-to-day viability of the city legally, in that form of government, you 
can have that kind of study.
-Also, regarding the improvement, their system is a little different.  If 
you look at the demographics, they do not have the homeless issue that we have, 
the health care issues, but more importantly, the takeover of Hong Kong. If you 
are a Hong Kong citizen, you have a right to the Vancouver tons of money left by 
Hong Kong in the mid 1990âs.
-A lot of Hong Kong people could not get into the USA.  Instead, they went 
to Vancouver.  You can get the funding you need to build in that city.  There 
are a lot of corporations, a lot of people who came from Hong Kong and have the 
money.  They had funding sources so they could become citizens.  The USA has a 
similar program.  If you bring $1 million and hire 10 people for three years to 
help the economy that will help you to expedite your citizenship application.
-Also, I noticed this week that Berkeley is trying to expedite their 
permits for more development.  Given that we have the high unemployment rate, I 
would like the staff to give the Planning Commission updates on San Franciscoâs 
unemployment rate.  The State puts a report out.  Statewide unemployment is 
12.4%.  We need to know exactly what the unemployment rate is.  Second, I saw 
the title of the newspaper this morningâs business section.   The assessed 
values of properties has gone down 24%, that means that the general public needs 
to know if their property value goes down by 24%, we lose 24% of our property 
tax.
Commissioner Olague:
-  
I guess when we are talking about shadows, part of the issue comes up because we 
are forcing so much density into the downtown areas because that seems to be 
where a lot of the issue regarding shadowing concerns are.
-  
We should look at ways where we might be able to absorb more density in areas 
other than the east of the City.
-  
I know that Commissioner Lee has raised several times the issue of in-law units, 
so we should look at the RH-1 district and where maybe that is not longer 
working given the kind of focus and direction.
-  
I think in many ways, the CEQA process is broken.  If we look at the numerous 
appeals that we have, we have to turn the mirror and look at ourselves and what 
we could be doing better.
Commissioner Sugaya:
- 
It would be interesting to see something â maybe I guess the logical place is 
out of the economistâs office, to let us know what may be the case, because I 
read a separate article, and it said that San Franciscoâs drop was only 12% 
compared to other counties, where they were falling by up to 40%.
Commissioner Miguel:
-I wanted to mention that I have had some meetings this week regarding the 
discretionary review reform, and for a project on Arkansas Street.  I was also 
able to get some neighbors and Safeway representatives in a series of 
conversations regarding the possible re-do of the Safeway store on La Playa out 
at Ocean Beach.
-In particular talking about other countries, specifically Canada, the 
February issue of The American Planning Associationâs magazine, I found what I 
thought for San Francisco was a very interesting article regarding the area.
-Often the case in the US, the process of creating such a huge project is 
what they are doing there â covering 325 acres has been the worse for some time 
(almost 30 years). It is complicated and controversial and has changed the way 
major developments have typically been undertaken in Paris by institutionalizing 
a citizen committee that remains in place after the project is completed.
-I am thinking of our committees that are working on Octavia Street or 
Eastern Neighborhoods.  The article goes on quite a bit and says that the 
decision to drastically alter the rules by which Paris conducts planning an 
Administrative Court Judge ruled in the community groupâs favor, giving them 
more than they had hoped for. Public forum reworking the project plan - the 
judge called for the creation of a committee made up of representatives of 
community groups and city officials to oversee the project construction.  The 
concluding paragraph says that the one indisputable success of the participation 
process, first formulated in Paris, has become a standard throughout France. 
 While the law has been trying to value the direct citizen involvement in every 
major development project, Paris has become a model for incorporation of the 
public ideas in the planning structure.
-San Francisco was a little ahead of this. It sort of shows that there are 
other areas of the world that has understood that public process, although 
condemned in many circles, probably is the correct way to go.
