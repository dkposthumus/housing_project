C.COMMISSIONERS’ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
7.         Commission Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements.  Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Antonini:
Last week we had a long discussion regarding the consideration of financial institutions and formula retail.  A number of speakers made some good points that I agreed with. I just want to comment a little bit on some of the things I believe in. I think the one thing that we don’t probably address at present time is the appropriateness in a neighborhood commercial district as to their formula retail.  Right now the legislation is such that all neighborhood commercial districts require that formula retail have conditional use. I think each neighborhood, should be able to collectively decide what controls works best for them.  In some instances the discretionary review [procedure] may be the better solution, or maybe it is conditional use.  There are some neighborhoods that actually welcome properly regulated formula retail as a stimulus to the neighborhoods that are economically depressed.  Another thing that I think we need to take a look at is the architectural quality and presentation of all businesses, particularly those who have logos and art that is standardized - some standard signs to just sort of see if this can part of the process.  Whatever the process could be, whether it is discretionary review or a conditional use, that this be looked at carefully.  I know in some instances in the East Bay where on one side of the freeway is horrible - almost no controls on signage, and the other side everything blends nicely with the context that is there.  You do not even know that there is formula retail because they fit in so well.  So, I think that is an important point. Also, of course, we want to make sure that we always look at everything - in particular the type of situation for the neighborhood - not just for protection, but basically what is best for the neighborhood because competition is important.  Also, it is very important to make sure that we look at the individual businesses as we go forward - are they native San Francisco businesses? Do they employ San Franciscans? Are they part of our fabric, or are they from somewhere else?
Commissioner Moore:
Talking about formula retail, I have a question for the Director. It was actually quite a shock that I came across a CVS pharmacy in the Financial District on California Street [on the 400 block, on the south side] where normally we have traditional banks and historic buildings, and all of a sudden knowing how you can change to a formula use on that street, I see a CVS occupying a historical building. On top of that this CVS pharmacy is the only one that has a protruding sign on that street that no one else is allowed to have. So, I am just curious how this happened.
Secondly, I understand that the Metreon has been sold. it is obvious that has not come to this Commission once it turned out of redevelopment; and my question to the Director is when there is a change of ownership, does that mean that the entitlement that were given remains the same, or are the changes being reviewed by some else?
Commissioner Miguel:
It was my understanding that signs are non-conforming. In addition to that, during the past week, I had conversations with individual businesses and supervisors regarding projects on 9thAvenue, regarding CPMC student housing.
Director Rahaim:
Just one announcement: I think you all received the announcement that we have released the draft of the Community Safety Element of the General Plan on Wednesday in conjunction with the Anniversary of the Great Earthquake.  I just want to remain you and the public what the purpose of the Community Safety Element is.  It devotes a new section on response and recovery.  We maximize our availability to save lives and address injuries after an event.  The changes on the update are not significant but they are important to support various another departments, and an initiative is underway to increase earthquake emergency preparedness.  There is number of them as you know.  We will be proposing to initiate the adoption of this element at Commission in May.

9.Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
No Report
BOARD OF APPEALS:
There was a case last night that the Zoning Administrator (ZA) thought would be of interest to this Commission.  It was an appeal of a ZA letter to the Entertainment Commission from October 2011, for property at 1337 Grant Avenue.  In this letter the ZA requested that the Entertainment Commission conditions of approval on a place of entertainment permit for the property be consistent w/ the conditions required by the Planning Commission and the conditional use that was authorized in 1997, which required that the music to be non-amplified.  The appellant argued that this conditions were superseded  by a 2005 conditional use to add a bar to the property and the previous tenant has operated without this limitation. The Board found that conditions of approvals from 1997 due remain in full force and upheld the ZA determination.  The Board directed the appellant to file for a conditional use permit if they want to amend the previous conditions of approval. The appellant indicated they have scheduled an intake appointment to take care of that.
HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:
The Commission [HPC] approved sharing one Commission Secretary with the Planning Commission; and established a sub-committee (Richard Johns, Diane Matsuda, and Karl Hasz) to work with the Planning Commission (or sub-committee of the Planning Commission), the currant Commission Secretary, Department staff, and DHR to develop a job description that requires, among other things, dedicated balance to the needs of both commissions, and establish other priorities of the position.  The vote was unanimous.
