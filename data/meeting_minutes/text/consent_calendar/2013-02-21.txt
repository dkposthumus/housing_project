Commissioner Antonini:
I'd like to ask that we adjourn today in memory of Lou Spadia. I'd like to just say a few words about Mr. Spadia because I think there are some great life lessons here for those of you who did not know who he was or did not see the obituary in the Chronicle or Examiner. Lou was a native San Franciscan, raised in Potrero Hill. And like was the case with my father, he didn't learn English ‘till he went to Elementary School. I'm not sure which school it was, but it was somewhere in San Francisco. I'm not sure if this was the case for Lou also, but my father got to do the first grade twice because the nuns at St. Michael’s in Livermore wanted to make sure he was fluent in English before he advanced. I think it served him well through the rest of his life. In fact, he gave them a considerable sum when he passed way because he felt they were successful because of their insistence on his fluency in English. Anyway, more on Mr. Spadia, he advanced through high school, he was so fluent and so well liked that he became student body President in Mission High School, then right after the war he got out of the service and was probably the first employee of the San Francisco 49ers when they were formed by the Morabito brothers in 1946 as part of the All-American Football Conference, and his early jobs included things like being the equipment man, making travel arrangements and having to do bed checks on players to see that they were in bed. But I think the lesson here is he worked really hard and worked his way up through the organization, becoming business manager in '57 and becoming CEO after the second of the Morabitos passed away in the mid-1960s. And he also was influential with the NFL in persuading Pete Rozell, another product of San Francisco and graduate of USF, to start putting national ads in NFL programs and it was the beginning of the growth of the league, but what's even more important, Mr. Spadia went on as CEO until the team was sold to the Dibartolo's in the late 1970s. He gave back to the community which I think is really important. He formed the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame, and was known as the Hall without a hall because he said that the money we raised on this event we don't want spend to build a structure to house the plaques of the players. We want to give it to children to help them in sports and their educations. So, that's really important. And I think the lessons, as I mentioned, is, even today, I think if you'll work hard and persevere, you can advance in an organization, and I know of situations in today's world where people will begin at the bottom and rise to the top of organizations by hard work. And secondly, of course, it's very important to be fluent in the language of your country, in this case English. And third you've got to give back to the community for the things that were given to you. So, I think Lou is a great example and that's why I want to adjourn in his honor.
Commissioner Sugaya:
I had the privilege of meeting Mr. Spadia when I was a little kid.  He was a member of St. Pius Church where one of my very good friend's mothers was a secretary. So, we had occasion to meet him. I don't remember exactly, but anyway, I’d like to thank Director Rahaim for the Railroad Boulevard I-80 I-280 project memorandum, and I assume at some point in the future we'll actually have some presentation or something when it gets along far enough. And then, we also, courtesy of our Secretary and I believe the Mayor's Office received a list of the current -- this week's agenda items for various Commissions and Boards. And I'd just like to note that under Entertainment, on the 19th, they had an issue which was Town Music Studio at 1660 Geary Boulevard, place of entertainment permit. And that is in the Japan Center. So, could staff look into that a little bit and give  --  maybe just give us a short, like a memo or something on what's going on with that. Given that Other Entertainment seems to have caused some issues. And then under the Building Inspection, there was discussion and possible action -- I'm just reading this -- on a proposed ordinance amending the Building Code to establish Mandatory Seismic Retrofit for Wood Frame Buildings of three or more stories and containing five or more dwellings. Could we also get some information?
Jonas Ionin, Acting Commission Secretary:
In fact, that is on your Advance Calendar as a future presentation.
Commissioner Borden:
I also got to know Lou Spadia, I worked at the Chamber, in his years he would actually still come in. It was always such a delightful person to have around. If people don't know what the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame is, when you're in the United Terminal at San Francisco International Airport, that’s where it manifests itself, you will see the plaques and the recognition of all the great athletes. I think it’s just a really smart idea and a great way that makes our airport terminal very local and interesting. The other thing I wanted to announce is that the Red Cross has moved into their new offices at 1663 Market at Gough and this Friday they're having an opening blessing. So, if you're around, it is in the building where Café Trieste was and Martha’s Brothers will be going in at some point. You can come see a great adaptive reuse project of a great old building that is being inhabited and what they will have at some point in the future is the disaster operations center for San Francisco for when there is a major seismic event and they're going build a state-of-the-art disaster operations center because we actually don't have one.
Commissioner Moore:
Commissioner Borden, could you send out a quick e-mail to us so that we kind of know the time and date and repeating the location one more time.
6.     Director’s Announcements
DIRECTOR RAHAIM:
Just a couple of quick announcements, we have had the Green Connections Plan that we've been working on with a number of City and nonprofit agencies including the Parks Alliance, Lock San Francisco and Nature in the City. There has been a survey that has been online for a number of weeks that closes at the end of the month. So, just to offer -- want to get their last thoughts in on that. That survey will close. It's on the Planning Department website. That survey does close on February 28th. I wanted to let you know that the Japantown Plan, which the community has now changed the name of to the Japantown Cultural Heritage and Economic Sustainability Strategy is now available online on the Department's website. Or through the Japantown Task Force as well. That community has completed its work on that plan and the draft is out for public comment. And there is a public meeting on that plan on next Tuesday, the 26th, from 5:00 to 8:00 P.M. At the Japanese Cultural and Community Center at 1840 Sutter Street, so, that is to talk about the draft of the whole plan that the community has completed. Finally, I just wanted to let you know that we are on track with the Academy of Art and the violations, the conditions of the notices of violations. They have met their first two rounds of deadlines. So, they have met the requirements that we asked them to meet to date, and we are working with them on a series of -- we are scheduling a series of meetings to go over the details of our long-term plans. And also, of course, on any of the conditions in the enforcement actions, but we are on track as of right now with the Academy. That concludes my report. The Zoning Administrator tells me that there was a Board of Appeals hearing last night, but there wasn't anything related to Commission actions. He will be here next week to give you a fuller report on the Board of Appeals as well.

HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:
Tim Frye of Department staff to provide you with a presentation on yesterday’s Historic Preservation Commission, it was a very short hearing, so, there's only a couple items to share with you. The Commission continued its decision on who to appoint to the Historic Preservation Fund Committee. As you know, this is a Committee that was made up of variety of stakeholders from the preservation community and various City agencies as a result of the Emporium settlement a number of years ago. The Historic Preservation Commission has one appointment to that Committee and has decided to postpone that decision until all members of the Commission are appointed. The Commission also received an update from Commissioner Hasz on 900 Innes. This is the Shipwrights Cottage down at 900 Innes in the Bayview neighborhood. There are some outstanding DBI violations on the landmark property. Commissioner Hasz was appointed to work with the community and Randy Shaw, the property owner, in finding ways to raise the money for a new roof on the structure and to secure the structure and to address the outstanding violations. And he gave a report on the estimates that are currently being procured via several contractors and will report back to you once the community and the property owner have a better idea of what direction they're going to take to address the violations. Commissioner Hasz will also be present at the DBI hearing in early March to represent the Historic Preservation Commission along with the Planning Department and the property owner.
