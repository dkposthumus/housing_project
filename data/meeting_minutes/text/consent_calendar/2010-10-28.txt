Commissioner Antonini:
My congratulations to Scott Sanchez.  On another item today, in today' s 
"Chronicle," great area -- great article on the area south of the China Basin. 
There were a couple of things I think the public should know about that. The 
area is large, and there is talk of an arena that would only take up a portion 
of that. My calculations are only maybe 25% of the available area, so there is 
room for more development still consistent with the parking needs which the 
Giants have which I think would be sufficient for the arena use. The second 
thing about the arena is not just focused on the Warriors or an NBA team, which 
is very important, but I think that facility would get used as many as 300 days 
a year because it is such a good location. I have talked to a number of people 
in the entertainment area, and they feel it might be a site for major concerts' 
because people want to be in san francisco and its accessibility is terrific. I 
think it would be a greateconomic boom, not to mention other things we cannot have now because of the 
facility not being there.I have mentioned major political conventions and other 
events that require that kind of facility. it would be great, but much more can 
be done at that site in addition to just that and that would help it make -- 
help make it more sustainable.
Commissioner Sugaya:
I had an opportunity to attend the scoping commission for the Academy of Art 
Tuesday night in downtown at one of their facilities, at Post and Mason Streets. 
There are quite a few people there, but it was interesting to the extent that it 
kind of reminded me of some of our hearings, where 90% of the people who were 
there sung the praises of the Academy of Art University rather than talking 
about what should be covered in the environmental report. And I think that we 
can expect the same at future hearings, or people from far away -- as Contra 
Costa County came to testify. In any case, there were other targeted comments, 
and I don' t know if it was that truthful, but I know it is part of the process.
President Miguel: 
  I also would like to individually compliment Scott Sanchez. I appreciate the 
work you have done so far. It has been interesting, from time to time I watch 
onTV the Board of Appeals, and I think you represent the Department extremely 
well, and that is greatly appreciated. During the week, I have had occasion to 
interface with some of the members of the HPC, both sides of the pacific project 
that will be before us. I have had the pleasure of being on a panel Monday that 
was chaired by John King from "The Chronicle," which was very interesting, as 
well as talking to some of the people who are involved with the health services 
master plan and with the Booker T. Washington project.

Directorâs Announcements
John Rahaim:
My congratulations to  Scott and I look forward to working together with him in 
the coming years. I went to the neighborhood at work Friday afternoon to discuss 
a number of topics with the residence. one of the things I wanted to mention to 
you is we will be, towards the end of the year, probably early December, giving 
you an update on the overall action plan, wrapping that up, and presenting to 
you some of our recommendations for changingthe items under due process for internal procedural changes, primarily, and we 
will beconvening with public stakeholders on that process in early December as well. 
That group requested that we hold that meeting on Saturday morning rather than a 
weekday evening so we could have better attendance. So we will do that. The 
other thing I wanted to mention, as you May recall, several months ago, the 
Mayor and Supervisor Chu had requested the department convene a park shattered 
task force to analyze the effects of development that is under way. Those 
meetings are being held on an infrequent basis, so for your sake and the 
public's sake, if your interested in attending, these meetings are available to 
the public and call the department and we will let you know when the next 
meetings are.
