commercial space located in a NC-3 (Moderate Scale Neighborhood Commercial) Zoning District and 80-D and

NOTE: On February 1, 2024, the Planning Commission held a public hearing on the certification of an EIR, 
adoption of CEQA findings, and a request for Conditional Use Authorization to allow a new Whole Foods Market 
grocery store at 2675 Geary Boulevard.  However, a separate agenda item was inadvertently omitted on the 
February 1, 2024, hearing agenda, therefore the Commission did not take an action on the adoption of CEQA 
Findings. As a procedural requirement, the Commission must adopt the CEQA Findings for the EIR (2019-
004110ENV-02), prior to the approval of the Project (2019-004110CUA-02).
