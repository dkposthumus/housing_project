– Request to modify the Inclusionary Affordable Housing Condition of Approval of the Downtown Project 
Authorization for the project (the “Initial Project”) at 30 Van Ness Avenue previously approved by the Planning

Van Ness Special Use District by the Board of Supervisors through approval of Ordinance No. 001-25 on January

Code Section 415 through satisfaction of the affordable housing fee in Planning Code Section 415.5, subject to

floor area of approximately 722,072 gross square feet of uses, with approximately 467,107 gross square feet of
