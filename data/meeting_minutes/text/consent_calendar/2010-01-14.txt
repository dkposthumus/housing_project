·Future Meetings/Agendas. At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Antonini:
A couple of items in the paper that I thought were note worthy: The first is an article by John Nolte in the paper on January 3rdabout the Duboce Park neighborhood and the changes over a span of time from 1972 to the present. A lot of times we have to look at our land use policies and make sure we are always encouraging people to renovate and improve their property to the highest amount possible. We have to be able to still take into consideration affordable housing. I think that by realizing more fees and revenue from these improvements we can build projects for affordable housing. Trying to keep places in disrepair with the idea being that these will provide for affordable housing is a disservice to everyone concerned.
The other thing I found that was interesting was part of a SPUR report that talked about contrast between transit systems in the Bay Area and in Washington DC. In the one area they said we were doing a bad job was the establishment of transit villages close to where the stops were. We havenât done much of that in the Bay Area. We are beginning to see some of it parts of the East Bay. I think we have to look seriously in San Francisco where possible â look for more densification and transit villages in areas that are close to the transit stops â putting people closer to transit where we can. I know these issues will come up in the next year.
Commissioner Sugaya:
I have a question for Director Rahaim. Are you familiar with the Washington (DC) metro area governments at all? Do they have more of a regional system in place?
Director Rahaim:
Sort of. They have something called The National Capital Planning Commission that covers the district and Maryland and some county in Virginia. They have some jurisdiction but not as much as you would have here.
Commissioner Sugaya:
I was going toward the direction that perhaps they had more transit villages because the regional system was more coordinated in terms of land use issues where as here it is totally everyone doing their own thing.
Director Rahaim:
I think there is pretty close coordination between Metro, which is the transit system, and those counties. But it is not necessarily the coordination that is mandated or codified.
Commissioner Sugaya:
On another observation: On next weekâs agenda there is a 6:00 agenda item which is 555 Washington. The calendar starts off with the certification of the final EIR, which needs to take place before we can consider the rest of the items on the agenda relative to that project. I understand then that Sue Bierman Park and the shadow issues are then calendared before our consideration of the actual project because itâs supposed to be a joint hearing with the Rec/Park Commission. But is seems a little backward to me to be having Rec/Park involved in shadowing issues and Sue Bierman Park issues when the Commission hasnât even rendered an opinion as to whether the project can be approved.
Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:
Commissioner, in order for the project to be approved, Park/Rec and the Planning Commission must understand the shadows and consider them. They have to make findings on the parks. So without the findings made on the parks, the commission canât approve them. You have to make a determination that the shadow that is created is acceptable before you can approve the project.
Commissioner Sugaya:
So if it is inappropriate, what happens to the project?
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
I think that we should probably discuss that under the calendared item.
Commissioner Lee:
Regarding the metro system in Washington DC, I happened to be going to school at that time when they started breaking ground. It is not just Montgomery County. Youâve got (other) counties. What they had was quite a bit of federal funding. They have a greater advantage in Washington DC than we do here because the feds funded most of that project.
On December 29ththere was an article in the Chronicle about âWhat Tourist Donât See in Chinatown.â This is an issue that they talk about affordable housing and the lack of housing. Well part of the problem is 30 years ago, some of the people that are criticizing the city now for lack of affordable housing are the ones that put in certain historical standards that you canât demolish buildings. And the zoning is so complex in that area that you really canât, without making major changes to the Planning Code, develop more housing. Chinatown is dying. They all know that. I think right now there is a political will to change some of the zoning on Broadway, Kearney and also Stockton. So Iâd like to get a one page summation of the zoning in Chinatown â what it is right now. Iâd like to speak to some of the people on the Historical Preservation Commission to see what areas we can have meetings of both commissions in maybe rezoning Chinatown so that we can have higher density for affordable housing.
Commissioner Borden:
On that Washington thing, one of the major differences also is that their transit system is designed to get people around the city as well as out of the city, where our system is designed very much to get people into and out of the city but not around the city. And also their phasing of their new metro stops all around the area including the exterior areas, they really look at where growth and development is happening and they plan to grow in those areas. I think that is a really smart thing. There is an agency that controls the Washington transit system (like BART) and looks at the growth patterns in a better way than we do.
Commissioner Moore:
Iâd like to express my concerns about next weekâs calendar. I believe that the severity of the issues in front of us next week starting with the Development Stimulus and Fee Reform item which is very important to give appropriate time to. Then it continues with the items Commissioner Sugaya mentioned that start at 6 p.m. Iâm sorry to be so verbal about it, but I do believe it to be an abuse of our time and our capabilities to act responsible and be alert. I have to assume, knowing what the issues are including the response to an unusually long and critically Draft EIR of 555 Washington, it will take us to 2 or 3 (a.m.) at night. Since we are tasked with making very difficult decisions, not even talking about how I feel about it or whatever, I do think that it is tasking, at least my capabilities to be alert and present. These are very weighty issues and I do think it is not very well scheduled.
Commissioner Antonini:
From what Iâve heard, I havenât seen the entire calendar yet, it seems fine with me. Remember we are starting at 10:30 I think â 11(a.m.). That gives us two and a half extra hours for some extra time depending on if we put a lunch in there. Iâm fine with it, although if there is a possibility and there are some items that are not as time critical as the more important issues; if there is anything that could be moved off of there to expedite it that would be fine. But for me I think the important items are the ones that have a lot of time-critical nature should probably be kept on.
Director Rahaim:
Commissioners, the reason that we did it the way we did it was (1) because of the joint hearing needs of the Rec/Park Commission; and (2) we moved the hearing up hoping we could have a gap between the end of your regular meeting and the start of the joint hearing. Rec/Park preferred meeting late because they have their regular meeting that starts at 4 p.m. We had a number of different contingencies facing us on this issue.
Commissioner Miguel:
I would like to commend Ms. Avery on the struggle she went through trying to get this thing through â first of all scheduling it at all, let alone at a particular time. It was not easy this time.
Commissioner Moore:
Iâm not debating that it was very difficult to schedule that. I am pointing out that there are other issues like the Fee Stimulus and Crystal Springs Pipeline. We are packing it on and there is no other room to give. In addition to that, the majority of us also have jobs. We work. We go to work every too. Itâs not just starting here at 11 oâclock and staying here until 2 oâclock at night.
Commissioner Miguel:
Just to report in: I had meetings this past week with Supervisors David Chiu and Eric Mar on items. Iâm sending a letter, not technically from the Commission, but from myself on the Commission, thanks to Sheriff Mike Hennesy for the assistance that his Deputy Sheriffs give to us. We had particular need for them a short time ago, and particularly when we have overflow rooms. They have been very capable in a cordial manner considering the handling the people who come to our meetings and are very considerate of our time, so I thought that was in order.
The question on transit in Washington DC, tomorrow I will be at a panel in Berkeley that is discussing SB-375 and the relationship between transit and housing. The Washington DC system is one of the items that is coming up on that as well as the inadequacy of what we have locally here.
Commissioner Olague:
Iâd like to ask the Department if they know of any studies that look at the connection between affordability and smart growth or dense housing near transit corridors because usually the economic equity issue gets always gets left out. I want to understand that a little bit better. We have this understanding that as the building rises so does the cost of construction. So how do we reconcile the idea of providing work force housing near transit corridors if itâs not done necessarily in an equitable manner? I want to know what the breakdown is and if there are any studies that have done on economic equity issues as they relate to smart growth.
Commissioner Miguel:
Commissioner Olague, the conference Iâm attending tomorrow is the Social Equity Conference and it is dealing particularly with low-income communities. So I hope Iâll get some information and be able to bring it back to you.
12. Directorâs Announcements
Director Rahaim:
The Land use Committee will have its next hearing on DR Reform on February 22ndand they have asked us to have additional meetings in advance of that time. We will have meetings at the Planning Department on January 27thand February 2ndat 6 p.m. For both of those dates we have invited community members to come to hear additional information and provide feedback.
13. Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS
Land Use Committee:
·Housing Practices of the Academy of Art University âSupervisor Mar requested a hearing on the housing practices of AAU. The Committee heard presentations by Planning Department staff, DBI, Housing Inspection, Fire Department and the SF Rent Board. The discussion centered on the various Planning Code and other municipal code violations by AAU over the last decade as well as the implication of these violations on the cityâs housing stock. The Committee expressed a desire for more definitive action to rectify current violations and to prevent future violations of municipal Codes. To that end, the Zoning Administrator discussed: (1) pursuing further enforcement actions against properties that were converted to AAU use after submittal of the environmental review; (2) the production of a timeline for environmental review; and (3) the possibility of taking existing CU applications to the Planning Commission for denial if timelines were not adhered to. Other ideas discussed at the hearing include (1) potential for new impact fees on private universities (similar to existing jobs/housing linkage fees imposed upon office uses; (2) removal of signs on properties that feature use violations and legalization of signs on properties that do not have use violations, and (3) a task force of relevant city agencies to coordinate compliance with City Codes.The item was an informational hearing and closed after approximately 1.5 hours of public comment.
Full Board of Supervisors:
·5 Foot Bonus for Active Uses in a limited area in District 11 âOn November 11/11/09, this commission recommended approval of this item. The Ordinance would provide up to a f-foot height increase where the additional height is applied to an active ground floor. When you heard the item you recommended approval with two modifications: (1) that the bonus apply to NC-1 zoned parcels in the vicinity (not just those that front Broad or Randolph Streets); and (2) that the bonus only apply to development proposing commercial uses on the ground floor.At Committee, Supervisor Avalos amended the legislation to accommodate both of the Commissionâs recommendations. With those amendments, the Board finally approved the ordinance this week.
·CU Appeal of 1969 California âThis commission granted a CU for this property to establish a commercial use in a designated city landmark when the landmark is located within a residential district on 10/8/09. At the hearing the Board seemed to agree that the gallery was an appropriate use. The issue of concern was what constituted an âeventâ and what kinds of non-art gallery events could occur in the space.The Board upheld the Planning Commission and added the following conditions to the CU: (1) Deliveries related to art gallery to occur on street cleaning days; (2) valet parking for events must arrange off-street parking for all vehicles, no use of street spaces. Valet parking operations must not unreasonably obstruct driveways at any time; and (3) No residential parking permits shall be sued by gallery employees. Alternatively, the gallery must provide employees with off-street parking.
Introductions:
·The Mayor & Board President Chiu introduced two pieces of legislation in light of the recent court decision titled âPalmer/6thST Properties vs. City of Los Angeles.âWhile the impact of this decision is not certain, the case may affect inclusionary requirements, especially as they relate to rental projects in San Francisco and other jurisdictions. The two pieces of legislation include: (1) a resolution establishing interim controls for Section 315 of the Planning Code: Affordable Housing Program; and (2) an ordinance amending Section 315 to change the Inclusionary Housing Requirements to an Affordable Housing Fee Program. The interim controls will ensure that projects currently moving through the entitlement process will conform to the requirements of the draft ordinance and thus will be consistent with the final ordinance/code changes when they are enacted. The permanent controls propose to modify Section 315 to a fee-based Affordable Housing Program, requiring all projects to pay an affordable housing fee to MOH: Under this proposal if a developer chooses to have the units be for sale or if they receive public assistance, then they retain the option of building the units on-site or off-site. NOTE: These amendments will not reduce or eliminate the affordable housing requirements. The proposal would also amend the Rincon Hill Area Plan affordable rental housing requirements to delete the requirement that 50% of on or off-site units be provided as rental.
·100061 âResolution stating that the Board opposes changes to the Prop K Park Shadow Ban that would increase shading of public parks and open space and instructing that this policy be communicated to the Rec & Park and Planning Commissions.
BOARD OF APPEALS:
·673-675 44thAvenueâ a demolition and subdivision of a very wide lot that you heard as a DR and the construction of two two-unit buildings. You did not take DR and approved the demolition and new construction. The Board did not overturn you. The voted 3 to 2 to uphold the Planning Commissionâs decision.
·MasonicTempleâ an appeal of a letter of determination by the Zoning Administrator. The Board upheld the ZA decision on a 2 to 3 vote. 4 votes are needed to overturn the decision.
