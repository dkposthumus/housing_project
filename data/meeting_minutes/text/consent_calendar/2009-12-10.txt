Commissioner Moore:
She reported that she participated in a neighborhood walk with the Mid-Polk Neighborhood Association the other day.  Director Rahaim, staff, and Supervisor Chiu also participated.  It was very informative and she appreciated the neighborhood being very organized.
Commissioner Antonini:
I had a meeting yesterday with an architect and project sponsor that we will be hearing sometime in January involving on site, off site, or in lieu fees.  I also want to thank Tiffany Bohi from Michael Cohenâs office and Peter Albert from MTA for a very informative tour they gave yesterday of the India Basin area, Hunters Point and Candlestick Point.  It was sort of like looking into the past and seeing the future.
Commissioner Moore:
[When looking through her envelope, she noticed a draft notice of cancellation that included January 7, 2010.]  She asked the Commission if they were aware of that and stated her preference to hold a hearing that day.  [It was determined to hold a hearing on January 7, 2010.]
Commissioner Miguel:
He met with the owner of the Tip Top Market and city representatives on how they are going and how the city is working with them.  We will get a report later on that.  He also met with people regarding the 7thAvenue project that is coming up in January regarding BMR.  I was a guess at the Community Leadership Alliance in the Tenderloin.  I met the new Police Captain down there and had a discussion with him regarding liquor licenses and that sort of thing, and enforcement.  Yesterday evening I had the pleasure of meeting with Mercy Housing and some of the community people regarding the project at Fulton and Gough on parcel G that is part of the old Central Freeway.
Commissioner Olague:
For the record, the only meeting Iâve really attended in the past two weeks was with a couple of Swedish-Americans of the Swedish-American Hall.  It was very enlightening to understand a little bit more the contributions of that culture in the Bay Area and in the upper Market.
5.         Directorâs Announcements
Director Rahaim:
I also wanted to mention the tour of the Middle Polk Neighborhood that Commissioner Moore mentioned.  I attended with three other staff and Supervisor Chiu and Commissioner Moore.  I always find it useful to see the neighborhood through the residentâs eyes.  It was a very interesting tour.
Tomorrow morning I will be attending along with Elaine Forbes and others, the DR Reform meeting in District 11.  It will take place at 10 a.m. at the Ingleside Police Station in Balboa Park.
