Commissioner Moore:
A few weeks ago I asked in public comment whether or not the Director would set up another update on the America's Cup. I was very fortunate on Tuesday night to hear a presentation by the Vice-President of the Golden Gate Yacht Club, who are the sponsors of the event, to hear an update. which I feel contain that so many interesting aspects of how the America's Cup has changed, relative to the race this year and a big one next year, that I think this Commission would be really interested to hear. I think the Planning Department themselves would be thrilled to see much of the discussions we had have all turned the event into something I think addresses a lot of very positive aspects. I sent an e-mail to Mr. Martin and Mr. Vanwater, who I believe are responsible in the Mayor’s Office to attend to this subject. If this could happen, probably not in preparation for the August racing, but the October racing, I think everybody will be well informed and feel comfortable for what is happening.
Commissioner Antonini:
We had an excellent meeting of the commission secretary search sub-committees that consists of members of Planning and HPC Commissions yesterday, and among the things handled at that meeting included adding some other sources or venues to announce the position opening. We did discuss the future calendar. We set up possible meeting dates in September and October, with a possible emergency meeting on August 22, which I will tell a little bit more about. That is in relation to the fact that we have yet to hear a response from the Department of Human Resources to whom we had sent a letter above the signatures of Presidents Fong and Chase asking for reclassification of the position relating to salary level and other issues relating to the classification. We have not received any response, and we are concerned because we cannot move further in this process without a response from DHR. For instance, the position notice cannot go out until the issue has been answered. We hope that will happen soon.  This is one of the reasons why we may have an emergency meeting on August 22nd, because if that has not been approved and/or it needs to be revised – this is the beginning of the process. Also yesterday we discussed the fact that there has been funding obtained for the managerial position in the Commission’s office at a Planner III class. We were told it would serve as an addition to the commission secretary team. Currently there are three members, and this will be a fourth member of that would serve under the secretary, and the secretary would be involved in this election of this individual, and it was expressed by the subcommittee and is the feeling that this position should be exclusively for the secretary’s team. Certainly the job description speaks to the very importance of this, and it is extremely important, because nothing can move forward and the Commission could not focus without the secretary during the myriad of things she does each week, so very important. Final thing, there was a closed session that dealt with interview questions, but we cannot talk about that because that was a closed session. The meeting was very good. We're making progress and moving forward on this.
Commissioner Sugaya:
I have one question, the position in the Department to assist the secretary, has that been posted yet or is that off in the future some time?
Director Rahaim
It has not been posted. The idea is the new secretary would help in the process. Just so you know, there is a posting -- we have to do an annual exam process for all positions at a certain classification, so we have to do the annual process. That process is just to create a pool of candidates to be considered.
Commissioner Sugaya:
I would just like to report that I had a meeting earlier today with the DR requestor for 434 Geary Boulevard, and they are the owners of the property next door. I did suggest that they should present us with photographs of the interior of the building. She may be e-mailing to all commissioners.
Commissioner Antonini:
I did have a meeting last night. The project is 434 Geary Boulevard. I have also been in touch with project sponsor, so I think this is an interesting project that hopefully we can work out something on it. It is scheduled on the calendar for next week. I also did want to comment on an article by John King and his concern that it seems like all office and residential buildings of any height are in glass or almost glass facades. I am a little concerned about this too. They can be very attractive, but they can also be very unattractive. I think most people have been very favorable to the 560 Mission project, which is one of the best examples of glass. I certainly hope that we have careful design guidelines as we move these things forward and go to staff for finalization; that they are looked at very carefully; not that you cannot have pre-cast buildings and be very attractive too, but I think he makes a good point. Certainly richness is important. I certainly would like to – it would be great if someone proposed a building of the first part of the Century, such as the Shell or Russ buildings for maps and also the Southern Pacific building. I think maybe the cost for construction is expensive and one of the reasons why we see so much glass, because it is much quicker to build and probably cheaper. I hope we can still maintain quality even with that. It was a very interesting article that raises some good points.
9.         Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
The only item I wanted to bring to your attention was the memo regarding the budget from Tom Desanto and Keith DiMartini, giving you an outline of the proposed budget. It was essentially the budget the Mayor proposed. There were some minor reductions that were approved by the Board related to temporary salaries and professional service contracts. The budget proposed by the Mayor, which was somewhat larger than what you look at originally, was largely approved by the Board of Supervisors.
