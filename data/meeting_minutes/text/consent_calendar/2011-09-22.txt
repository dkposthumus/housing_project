Commissioner Moore:
I wanted to ask the Director, staff and the Mayor's Office to 
talk with us about the San Francisco foreclosures and how they are affecting the 
City overall. There was an article in the newspaper, and while we are very aware 
of how foreclosures are ravaging the rest of the Country, we live in a healthy 
City where foreclosures are not as noticeable. However, this particular article 
indicates there is more to be concerned about than what meets the eye. Perhaps 
the article over stated that, but perhaps there should be a discussion about it 
because many of the decisions we're making are affecting the City at all levels 
â support structures, etc.  We need to get a feeling about which neighborhoods 
are hit and which parts of the population are affected and geographically how it 
plays itself out would be very important for us to take into consideration. I 
ask the Commission to support me on this, and ask for such a presentation, or 
have somebody that can fill us in. The second thing is, on a much brighter note, 
there was a screening of a movie last night at the Kabuki Theater of a film 
shown at the Toronto Film Festival. Commissioner Fong was good enough to pass 
our names around. The name of the movie is "Urbanized." it is a phenomenal movie 
about cities worldwide talking about urban issues and how people in 40 cities 
across the world are attacking the broadest range of issues. We talk about it 
every Thursday, but how the rest of the world addresses these issues is 
inspiring. I hope the entire Planning Department and anybody interested in City 
urbanism, I would encourage to see this movie. Its mind blowing, wonderful and I 
cannot speak more about the experience of having seen it last night.
Commissioner Antonini:
One subject we frequently talk about is transportation, which 
is where much of what planning revolves around. I came upon a pictorial book 
with text on the MUNI and there are very many interesting things in that book. 
It was one of the Nation's first transportation systems. Most of the others were 
private until 1913. They did some really marvelous things, mostly by building 
tunnels in places like Stockton Street, and the cut through to allow street cars 
to move quickly to various neighborhoods.  An interesting statistic is that the 
daily volume of Muni is greater than BART and Golden Gate Transit.  It is 
probably a fact that the number of people to take Muni per day is astonishing. 
We're moving a lot of people on any given day. One interesting statistic is we 
have a portion of Muni , the metro system, It has six different lines, and two 
of those lines, I'm not sure which ones, each carry more volume individually 
than the entire Santa Clara Valley Transit Authority light rail system in the 
South Bay. There is one down there, but nobody rides it. The point of this 
exercise is to make the public aware and talk to your representatives at the 
State and Federal level and let's get funding where people use transit, and that 
is in San Francisco. Let's try to revive the spirit of what was done many years 
ago and explore the idea of more transit in its own right of way â the ability 
to move people quickly other than competing with traffic on the street were 
possible. That's a really interesting situation. We see on a day like September 
11thwhen we had a game at Candlestick, we had a game that AT&T Park, 
we had Shakespeare in the park, and we had more than 120,000 people for those 
events alone. They did not ride Muni, but many of them did use public 
transport.
Commissioner Miguel:
There was a noontime forum this week on middle-income 
housing. Our Director was one of thepresenters as well as Ted Egan, the City's Economist. They did go into what you 
were discussing. It was well attended, and it was very interesting. Also during 
the week, I met with people from the Armory. One of the Department noontime 
forums was on windows. We often get a subject that comes in front of us on 
replacement windows â which ones not to use, etc., so for me and many in the 
Department, it was relatively educational. Yesterday, I met with the Executive 
Medical Committee of St. Luke's.
Commissioner Sugaya:
I don't know if I missed it at the last update, but 
apparently the Academy of Art University is now in ownership of the former 
Culinary Institute Building. Are they supposed to be doing that? I guess you are 
not supposed to answer that. It is our understanding that further purchases -- I 
don't know what the situation is but it seems this needs to have some vetting 
somewhere. The other concern is I don't know what its historic status is, I did 
not look it up to see if it was a landmark or not, but the access to public 
spaces on the interior is a concern I would like to voice at this point.
Commissioner Borden:
We're always talking economic development opportunities here. 
There's an organization called the Urban Desolations. They help do workshop 
improvement programs and write business plans and help them be â¦  They have an 
event coming up called Blocks of Art. All of the different galleries and 
restaurants will be open and there will be art displays and the goal is to get 
people down to that neighborhood to see what is going on there. All of these new 
businesses have come in and some of them are struggling. They are struggling 
because people don' t think to go to Sixth Street where there are stories about 
crime in that area and this initiative as a way to get people down in the 
neighborhood and expose them to the vitality that exists and encourage people to 
come back. It is October 14th and itâs between Market and Howard on Sixth 
Street. I will make sure there are some e-mails.  But I want the public to know 
because we spend a lot of time on trying to improve neighborhoods in commercial 
corridors and there are neighborhoods where wonderful things are happening, but 
they need support.
President Olague:
A lot of them hire locally. A lot of them are really great 
places. I do want to share myenthusiasm for the film "Urbanized."  We stuck around and answered questions 
after the second showing. There was a lot of enthusiasm from the audience. It 
was a really good crowd. I agree it should be mandatory. I was getting jealous 
when I was watching scenes from Bogota, Colombia and what they have done with 
bicycle lanes and sidewalks and roadways. I was looking at other cities and 
thinking why can't we do that here? Maybe we will hear from that -- maybe we 
will hear about that later on today.
Commissioner Moore:
I lost my train of thought. The Rapid Transit -- it was one 
of the things we were saying ourselves, it would be really fresh to grab onto 
projects that have proven to work across the world. That's what the movie is 
about and it is really inspiring.
Commissioner Antonini:
I was able to tour an area of a future project that won't 
come before us until next year.It is the San Francisco Overlook. It's a very interesting area in the Western 
part of San Francisco and I think everybody was able to see some of the 
beautiful things that have been done. There are trails up there that connect 
over there on a nice day, it's a great walk.
Commissioner Moore:
I received calls regarding the Armory and people suggesting 
that we ask the Historic Preservation Commission to weigh in. It's a very 
difficult situation, particularly when preservation is normally not asked on 
this project, but I think we could ask for them to look at it and give us their 
thoughts.
President Olague:
I also received those e-mail from the owner of the Armory and 
from Commissioner Martinez, -- requesting our review.  I gave that request to 
the Department so that we have asked HPC to review that. We have already made 
that request.
8.         Directorâs 
Announcements
Director Rahaim:
We are tentatively scheduling an informational hearing on 
November 17thwith regard to their [Academy of Art University] 
purchase of the property. We have said repeatedly they are able to buy 
properties, but it is how we it is used and controlled through the permitting 
process. That is the situation we're in with the Academy at this time.
Just some scheduling announcements:  tomorrow I will be 
speaking at the Annual San Francisco Business Times Structures Breakfast at 8:00 
A.M. along with the Mayor and several other speakers. I will be covering some 
Long-Range Planning projects along with the Central Core Plan we're getting 
underway. The Commission is off next week due to the Jewish Holiday and I will 
be taking a few days off at that time.  Bill Wycko will be in charge during that 
time.
9.         
Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and 
                         Historic Preservation Commission.
LAND USE COMMITTEE:
At Mondayâs Committee, 
Supervisor Farrell amended the Ordinance to include the second recommendation, 
but did not include the first recommendation pertaining to the max height of the 
free standing sign.With the amendment, the Land Use Committee forwarded the 
Ordinance to the full Board for this Tuesdayâs hearing. At the Tuesday meeting, 
the Board approved the Ordinance on first reading.
FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
INTRODUCTIONS:  NONE
Board of Appeals:
The Board considered one item 
that may be of interest to the Commission:
1727 Union Street(Brickyard)
The Board held their third 
hearing on an appeal of the building permit application for 1727 Union Street 
(dba Brickyard).  The Board previously heard the appeal on June 22, 2011 and 
August 10, 2011, and continued the item to allow the Permit Holder one final 
opportunity to meet with neighbors and submit modifications to the proposal to 
address neighbor concerns related to noise issues.  The Permit Holder submitted 
two alternatives.
The first option involved 
permanently closing all but one of the five doors that provide access to the 
patio (the Commission's approval required two doors to be permanently closed and 
allowed two to be opened as weather permits).  The second option involved 
replacement of the doors with a wall and single door providing access to the 
patio.  The neighbors did not support either alternative.
Inspector Granelli from the 
Entertainment Commission attended the hearing and discussed the sound readings 
that he took at the subject location and provided an informative overview of the 
noise ordinance.
The Board expressed their 
dissatisfaction with the Permit Holder and their efforts (or lack thereof) of 
working with the neighbors.  The Board also expressed concerns about the 
adequacy of the conditions imposed by the Commission and discussed (at length) 
possible alternatives.  The Board initially voted 3-2 to uphold the appeal and 
deny the permit; however, the motion failed because four votes are required to 
overturn a departmental action.  The Board ultimately voted unanimously to 
approve the permit with the condition that all but one of the doors be 
permanently closed and required the open door to be self-closing.
1731 15th Street(Group Housing)
As noted at previous meetings, 
last night the Board was to hear an appeal of a building permit application for 
a group housing use at 1731-15th Street.  Earlier this week, both parties 
(Permit Holder and Appellant) agreed to continue this item to December 14, 2011 
(the last Board hearing of the year) in order to allow additional time for 
settlement discussions so the Board did not consider this item last night)
HISTORIC PRESERVATION 
COMMISSION:
The Historic Preservation did meet yesterday. They had a 
couple of items before them for Review and Comment:Pier 36â after 
discussion, they felt their prior letter containing their comments were not 
sufficiently responded to. This time, they suggested altering the MOA with 
language that the interpretive program should be created by a historian that 
meets the qualifications of the Secretary of Interior Standards; HPCs prior 
letter should also be re-sent; and it should be pointed out that the prior 
comments previously forwarded were not adequately addressed.On the Natural 
Resources Area Management Plan:they approved sending a letter on the Draft 
Environmental Impact Report to the Departmentâs Environmental Review Officer 
that highlights four points:  1) the mitigation measure under MCP7 is to involve 
a historical landscape architect; 2) ICP8 is a significant adverse impact; 3) 
when the programmatic aspects of the development occur, the historic resources 
should be evaluated by a landscape architect and historian that meet the 
qualifications of the Secretary of Interior Standards; and 4) that as these 
projects move forward it is anticipated that they will undergo the Section 106 
(NEPRA) process for federal permits.  The letter should also point out that the 
commission could not agree on the integrity of Sharp Park. The commission also 
continued with its discussions ofArticles 10 and 11. They discussed part 
of Article 11 at this meeting until time ran out.  They continued further 
discussion until their October 5thmeeting.
