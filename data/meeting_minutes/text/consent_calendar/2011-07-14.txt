INTENTION TO INITIATE COMMISSION-SPONSOREDPLANNING CODE AMENDMENTS RELATED 
TO A PROPOSED PLANNING COMMISSION POLICY FOR STANDARDS FOR BIRD-SAFE BUILDINGS-Pursuant to Planning Code Section 302, the Planning Commission will consider a 
Resolution of Intention to initiate amendments to the Planning Code. The 
amendments are intended to a) reduce building-related hazards for San 
Franciscoâs resident and migrant bird species; b) establish consistent building 
standards for creating bird-safe buildings; and c) provide certain exemptions 
from these requirements. The proposed Ordinance would amend the Planning Code to 
create a new Section, 139 Standards for Bird-Safe Buildings; and would amend 
other sections, including Section 145.1; and adopting findings, including 
environmental findings, Section 302 findings, and findings of consistency with 
the General Plan and priority policies of Planning Code Section 101.1.
Preliminary Recommendation: Approve a draft Resolution of intention 
to initiate amendments to the Planning Code and schedule a public hearing on or 
after
