  None. 
12. REVIEW OF PAST EVENTS AT THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, BOARD OF APPEALS AND HISTORIC PRESERVATION 
COMMISSION 
Audrey Merlone: 
Good afternoon, Commissioners.  Audrey Merlone for Aaron Starr. And I will also echo on behalf of staff, thank 
you very much, Commissioner Koppel, for always treating staff with respect and kindness. So, with that, on the 
Board report, there is one item of interest at Land Use Committee this week.  This was Supervisor Peskin's Polk 
Street Neighborhood Commercial District ordinance. The ordinance would create an exception to allow store 
front mergers and large uses for certain limited restaurant uses that are also designated legacy businesses in 
the Polk Street NCD. You all heard this item last week and voted approval with two modifications. As a reminder, 
those modifications were first, to remove the prohibition on store front mergers and second, to conditionally 
permit uses that are 2,500 square feet or greater and remove the 4,000 square foot nonresidential use size cap.  
Unfortunately, Supervisor Peskin chose not to incorporate these recommended modifications. There were 2 
public comments in support of the proposed legislation at Land Use. They were both from the family who owns 
Bob’s Donut and they shared appreciation for support and their goals to relocate and expand. After hearing 
public comment, the item was sent with a positive recommendation to the Full Board. And at the Full Board this 
week, there were no Planning Department related items. Thank you.   
 
Corey Teague, Zoning Administrator: 
  Good afternoon, President Diamond, Commissioners, the Board of Appeals did not meet last night.
