8. REVIEW OF PAST EVENTS AT THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, BOARD OF APPEALS AND HISTORIC PRESERVATION 
COMMISSION 
 
Audrey Merlone: 
At the Land Use and Transportation Committee this week there were two landmark designations. The first was 
the Grand Theater at 2665 Mission Street. This landmarking was introduced by Supervisor Ronen, and 
unanimously approved by the Historic Preservation Commission on November 15th of last year. The building 
was designed by G. Albert Lansburgh and S. Charles Lee in 1940 and is significant for association with city’s 
network of neighborhood theaters, and as an excellent example of the Streamline Moedern style. 
 
The Committee voted unanimously to forward the landmarking on to the Full Board with a positive 
recommendation.
