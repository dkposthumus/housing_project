15. DIRECTORâ€™S ANNOUNCEMENTS 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
I'm not sure if we mentioned this in the past, but Lydia So has been nominated to sit on the Planning 
Commission by the Mayor to replace Commissioner Tanner. I believe she's scheduled for Rules next week, or 
that's what's anticipated. So, she's likely to join us sometime in May. She was on the Historic Preservation 
Commission, currently on the MTA Commission. So, we look forward to seeing her here.
