Land Use Committee 
 
 
221105 Planning Code - HOME-SF. Sponsor: Peskin. Staff: V. Flores.  
 
221021 Planning, Administrative Codes - HOME-SF. Sponsors: Dorsey; Peskin. Staff: V. 
Flores.  
 
 
This week the Committee took up the two HOME-SF ordinances, sponsored by President 
Peskin and Supervisor Dorsey. 
 
 
The first Ordinance, introduced by President Peskin, would amend the Planning Code to 
exclude Article 10 Districts from HOME-SF. 
 
 
The second Ordinance, introduced by Supervisor Dorsey, would amend the Planning Code 
to allow projects under HOME-SF to subject new dwelling units to rent control rather than 
increasing the affordability requirement.  
 
 
The Historic Preservation Commission and Planning Commission heard these items on 
February 15 and February 16th respectively. 
 
 
The Historic Preservation Commission adopted a recommendation of approval for both 
Ordinances. The Planning Commission recommended approval for the first Ordinance, and 
approval with modification for the second Ordinance. Those modifications included:  
 
1. Amend the legislation to allow projects with fewer than 10 units to participate in 
HOME-SF by subjecting the entire building to rent control. 
2. Require leases for these projects to disclose that the unit is subject to rent control. 
3. Eliminate the shadow/wind/historic resources criterion from the eligibility 
requirements. And   
4. Revise the eligibility requirement to allow the demolition of one unit. 
 
 
The Supervisor incorporated the first two recommendations in addition to four other 
amendments, which are: 
 
1. Eliminate the exemption from parking requirements since there are no longer parking 
minimums.
