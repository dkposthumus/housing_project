REVIEW OF PAST EVENTS AT THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, BOARD OF APPEALS AND HISTORIC PRESERVATION 
COMMISSION 
Aaron Starr, Manager of Legislative Affairs: 
Good afternoon, Commissioners Aaron Starr Manager of Legislative Affairs.  
 
Land Use 
The week Chair Melgar was absent from the Committee so she could attend Jury Duty. Supervisor Dorsey sat in 
on the committee but was not a voting member. 
 
Planning Code, Zoning Map - 2301 Chestnut Street Special Sign District. Sponsor: Dorsey 
 
The first item on the land use committee’s agenda was Supervisor Stephaie’s ordinance that would create a 
special sign district at 2301 Chestnut Street. Commissioners you heard this item on November 14th and 
recommended approval with one modification. This modification was to amend the Ordinance to allow all 
corner Commercial businesses in NC Districts to have two projecting signs. 
 
Because Supervisor Stefani was recently elected and sworn into the state Assembly, Supervisor Dorsey took up 
sponsorship of this ordinance. While the commission’s modification was not added to the original file, the 
ordinance was duplicated and Supervisor Doresy indicated that he would work on the amending the duplicated 
ordinance to allow two projecting signs for corner businesses in all NC Districts. The new ordinance would also 
likely sunset the special sign district as it would no longer be necessary.
