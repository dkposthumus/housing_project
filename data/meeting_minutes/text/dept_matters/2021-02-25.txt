Director’s Announcements 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Good afternoon, Commissioners. Just wanted to mention some nominations the Mayor 
made to the Historic Preservation Commission. Four seats were up and expired at the end of 
last year. The Mayor reappointed Diane Matsuda, who is currently serving as the Vice 
President, as well as Chris Foley. She nominated Ruchira Nageswaran, who is an architect 
with Knapp Architects in San Francisco, for seat 1 which is currently occupied by 
Commissioner Hyland. And seat 3, there’s been no nomination yet made in that seat 
currently held by Commissioner Pearlman. So, I think – the three nominees are at Rules 
Committee next Monday, could be at the Board on Tuesday, then seated for next 
Wednesday’s Commission hearing. Thank you.

Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
 
I don’t have any report from the Board of Appeals and the Historic Preservation Commission 
did not meet yesterday, but you were advised of the current situation at the Historic 
Preservation Commission by the Director just now.
