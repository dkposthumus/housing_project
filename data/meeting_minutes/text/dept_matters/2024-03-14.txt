9. DIRECTOR’S ANNOUNCEMENTS 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Just welcome, Commissioner Williams. I don’t -- he didn’t mention but we had the pleasure as a staff of working 
with you I think a decade ago or maybe a little more on the Excelsior Strategies which I was on the Commission 
when we heard them. I think, Commissioner Moore, you were here. But it was a great collaborative community 
process. So, thank you for your work there and we’re looking forward to working with you in the future here on 
the Commission. So, welcome.
