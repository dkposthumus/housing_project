Director’s Announcements 
 
Director John Rahaim: 
Commissioners, I was actually going to call that memo to your attention that we put in the 
packet for today's meeting that Tom DiSanto wrote about technology updates. I’m not 
going to go through these items in detail but I did want to kind of summarize very briefly 
the various enhancements that we are doing. The Building Eye map, which is the first item 
noted on the memo, is a very interesting interactive map that the public can use to actually 
find out, parcel by parcel, what's going on in the city, and it allows you to search in active 
applications by location, by date, by a whole number of factors so it's actually quite useful. 
The Records Digitization process is probably the single largest thing we're doing - if you've 
been to the Department, you will see that the huge file room we have is no more, that we 
used to have. All those files are now digitized and that's actually the reason that more 
information is available to the public than there used to be. We've had some comments 
from the public about suddenly more information coming being available online than 
there used to be when they were researching projects and that's exactly because 
everything is now digitized and we’re actually airing on the side of literally digitizing every 
single piece of paper in the files. It’s a massive two or three year project that actually Ms. 
Silva is in charge of and is really doing a great job. We are also switching to an electronic 
document management system related to that. We are making further improvements to 
the Property Information Map, which is a very, very popular map on our website, very 
popular system, and we are moving into the 21st century in a number of other ways. We 
will finally, next month, have citizen access to the Accela system. For us, as you know, we 
have been live on the Accela system for 3 ½ years, I think. So for now, it will be access only
