Directorâ€™s Announcements 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Just a couple of follow-ups from questions you all had at previous hearings. One, we had a 
discussion with the community about Trader Joes. I think they came to talk in General 
Public Comment. Not a ton of progress on the movement of Trader Joe's starting 
construction, although Supervisor Preston has called for a hearing. That will be held in 
early April, and we'll participate in that and hopefully hear directly from the sponsor and, 
or Trader Joe's. You also asked about the concrete building standards, and I checked in 
with Brian Strong who's the Chief Resilience Officer at the City Administrator's office. 
They're not quite ready for a hearing. They're still kind of working doing outreach on that, 
but they said in late summer or early fall they may be ready for a hearing. And then there 
was a question about there's 4 Silicon Valley Bank and their relationship to a few projects, 
affordable housing projects, by MOHCD. There are four projects that are currently under 
construction and MOHCD doesn't anticipate any change to that. There may be a different 
entity who's actually the lender in this, but they're working with SVB or the entity that's 
going to take over those loans and they don't expect any change. There's one project that 
hasn't started construction, whereas SVB is the lender, the construction lender, so they're 
exploring options on that one as well, but hoping that there'll be no delays to those 
projects as a result of that. That's all I have.
