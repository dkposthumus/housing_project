Directorâ€™s Announcements 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Thank you all. Just want to recognize a Planning anniversary of sort. This is a portion of the 
meeting where I'll be doing it. I'm like Willard Scott doing anniversaries and birthdays, but 
this month marks the five-year anniversary of your unanimous adoption of a resolution 
that reformed our Transportation review for CEQA. And if you recall, I think some of you 
were on the Commission and I was. We changed our analysis from a Level of Service or 
LOS, to Vehicle Miles Travelled or VMT. Which looks at the amount in distance of car travel, 
car travel via project.  It was somewhat of a technical change but somewhat revolutionary 
in a sense that kind of more aligned with our Transportation and Environmental policies. 
So, just wanted to recognize that. It was a huge undertaking and something that was 
underway for probably a decade or more. And a ton of our staff and MTA and CTA and City 
Attorney and OEWD staff worked on it and you all adopted it and I think the benefits are 
proven. We were able to streamline the CEQA approvals for safety, transportation safety, 
and mobility projects and housing projects. And while we were the first county to adopt 
VMT, others have followed suit: San Jose, Oakland, LA, and San Diego. So, just wanted to 
recognize that.  
 
I also wanted to recognize and thank Commissioners Hyland and Pearlman who had their 
last hearings at HPC, the Historic Preservation Commissions over the last couple of weeks 
and just thank them for their service and work with the Department over the years. And 
welcome Ruchira Nageswaran, who is the new Commissioner at HPC. The Mayor also 
nominated Cristina Dycus and she's working her way through the Board confirmation 
process. And that's all I have. Thanks.
