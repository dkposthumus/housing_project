John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
Well, only one announcement Commissioners. Last week we had the honor of, the 
Department had the honor of getting a couple of awards from the Northern California 
Chapter of the American Planning Association. We received an award for the Central SoMa 
Plan. We also received an award for the recent policy change to eliminate parking 
requirements citywide, which you all supported, which the Board supported. And thirdly, 
one of our planners, Veronica Flores received an award as a New Emerging Young Planner 
for the City, so we were very proud of her and very proud of all the awardees in the 
Department. So, we just wanted to make that announcement and congratulate everyone.  
Thank you.
