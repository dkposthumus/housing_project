Directorâ€™s Announcements 
 
Director John Rahaim: 
Just one announcement today, I wanted to let you know last night I went to the Southeast 
Facilities Commission meeting to talk about the 1550 Evans Project. I think you remember, 
there were a number of members of the community, who came out a few weeks ago 
concerned about a position, that, I had proposed, of adding housing to a site, that had 
been proposed by the community, and the PUC, for a Community Center and Education 
Facility. I had not been aware when I first proposed that idea with a couple of colleagues 
that this process had been going on with the community for several years, where they had 
agreed on a plan and a facility for this site that is owned by the PUC. So, last night I went to 

San Francisco Planning Commission
