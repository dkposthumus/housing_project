Directorâ€™s Announcements 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Thank you, commissioners, I just wanted to do the same and recognize former 
Commissioner Ron Miguel and pass on the Department's condolences to his wife, kids and 
family. I got to know him over the last couple of decades working with him as he sat on the 
Commission here. I often presented as a city staff person before him, but also sought out 
his advice and guidance. I think from Commissioner Johnson's description, he always had 
great advice that was direct and concise and was to the point. It was implementable and I 
sought that out often. Even after I sat on the Commission, he set out his advice on how to 
be a good commissioner. He was tremendously respected by city staff and staff within the 
Planning Department. He helped shape the Market-Octavia Plan, the Eastern 
Neighborhood Plan, the Transit Center district when he was a commissioner. He had a 
keen understanding of San Francisco in our neighborhoods and will be sorely missed. 
Thank you, all for your comments. That concludes my report.
