Director’s Announcements 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Good afternoon, commissioners. I just wanted to make one announcement. You have been 
getting some emails and public comment about 317 and our demo calcs. Obviously, a 
topic we have talked about over the years, where we have had proposals and the Board 
has proposals. But I just wanted to let you know, we are working on it, both coming up 
with our own potential changes to 317, as well as working with supervisors who are also 
working on this issue. So, we will be bringing it before you. I don't necessarily have a 
timeline yet but either through a board proposal or our own, this issue, you know, we 
intend to bring back to you. Thanks.
