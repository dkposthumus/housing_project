Director’s Announcements 
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
One more.  Commissioners, on behalf of the Department, thank you for everything you've 
done. And I just will say, and we can say more next week, two things, one is, I'm looking 
forward to working with you in your new role. I think it would be great to have you there 
and to have that connection and your knowledge from here and working with you there. 
And secondly, we need to have an appropriate sendoff for the next couple of weeks. So, 
we’ll all start thinking about that. Thank you.
