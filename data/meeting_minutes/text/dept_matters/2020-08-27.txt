Director’s Announcements 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Thank you, Commissioners. Thank you, Commissioner Imperial and Moore for the 
comments on the internship program and participating in it. I do want to thank Tina Tam 
who led the effort with our interns. As you know, many agencies and corporations got 
canceled their internship programs over the summer because of COVID and we made our 
conscious effort to keep ours going. And I think it was tremendously successful. So, we sent 
around a link, please do take a look at those presentations.  
 
So, welcome back to everyone and congratulations Commissioner Diamond, Imperial and 
President Koppel on your reappointments to this commission. A few items, you probably 
have heard that Jeff Joslin announced a few weeks ago that he was leaving his position as 
our Director of Current Planning. His last day was last week, August 20th. So, I just wanted 
to publicly thank him for his 7+ years with the Department and his leadership at Current 
Planning. He was definitely unprecedented at times and that he was here - - and especially 
I want to highlight his work building our capacity around Design Review and Preservation. 
I think the changes he’s made will have a lasting impact on our work for years to come. So, 
thank you to Jeff. Liz Watty who’s been the Deputy Director of Current Planning for the 
past 4 years has taken over in an acting capacity while we take out a process to fill that 
position. So more to come on that.  
 
Our offices officially moved to 49 South Van Ness last week.  It was a bit odd because we 
didn’t physically move, our stuff moved. So we haven’t been able to occupy the space. 
Some staff had gone in to unpack and do some work.  We are still awaiting any additional 
guidelines from the City, DHR, and DPH on how and when we will ultimately be able to 
occupy the space.
