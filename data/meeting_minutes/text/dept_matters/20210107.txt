Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic 
Preservation Commission 
 
 
Aaron Starr, Manager of Legislative Affairs: 
 
Good, good afternoon, Commissioners. Aaron Starr, Manager of Legislative Affairs. This 
week, the Land Use Committee considered two resolutions to Initiate landmark 
designations, both sponsored by Supervisor Peskin. The first list for One Montgomery and 
the other one was for the John Deere Buck Coffee Company at 447 Battery Street. Both 
resolutions were unanimously recommended to the Full Board.  
 
 
 
At the Full Board this week, the Supervisors passed on second read Supervisor Ronen’s 
ordinance that would allow light manufacturing and wholesale storage on the 24th Street - 
Mission NC District as well as the Mayor's ordinance that would amend the Planning Code 
to continue to allow existing NCDs to sell Adult Use Cannabis until they can convert to 
Cannabis Retail. And that is all I have for you tonight. Happy New Year. Thank you. 
 
 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
 
The Historic Preservation Commission did meet yesterday briefly. They only had Legacy 
Business Registry applications on their Agenda, but they did adopt recommendations for 
approval for all of them. That included the American Conservatory Theater Foundation, The 
Center Hardware & Supply Company, Pipe Dreams on Haight Street, Blade Runners Hair 
Studio and the 24th Street Dental Office.
