8. DIRECTOR’S ANNOUNCEMENTS 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Just one item from me. I would ask if we can adjourn today's meeting in honor of Gigi Platt, who passed away. 
She passed away yesterday. I heard from Mark Reiser. She served on the Landmark Preservation Advisory Board, 
I think in the 70s or maybe the 80s, but she was a fierce advocate for Preservation. She also sat on the Historic 
Preservation Fund Committee, which was that $2.5 million settlement from Westfield and kind of advising on 
how we spent that money. She was on the Board of Heritage, where she was legendary in the Preservation 
community. So, I just ask that we adjourn the meeting in her honor. We're doing the Citywide Survey, which I 
think is something she pushed for years to do. 
President Tanner: 
Certainly. 
9. REVIEW OF PAST EVENTS AT THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, BOARD OF APPEALS AND HISTORIC PRESERVATION 
COMMISSION 
Aaron Starr, Manager of Legislative Affairs: 
 
Land Use Committee 
230704 Planning Code - Fleet Charging Locations and Parcel Delivery Service. Sponsor: Chan. Staff: Delumo.  
 
First on the agenda was Supervisor Chan’s ordinance that would prohibit Parcel Delivery Services from being an 
accessory use to Fleet Charging. Commissioners, you heard this item on November 16 and recommended 
approval with modifications.  
 
That modification was to amend the language to make clear Parcel Delivery Service activity would still be allowed 
with a separate entitlement.
