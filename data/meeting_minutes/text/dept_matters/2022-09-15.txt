1. Landmark Designation for City Cemetery –   
 
The landmark designation for City Cemetery, sponsored by Supervisor Chan was heard 
at Land Use Committee this week. Supervisor Chan gave a brief history of the site, 
highlighting the importance of the site to the City’s Italian, Chinese, and Scandinavian 
immigrants. If landmarked, City Cemetery would also be the first archeological 
landmarked site in the City. The Supervisor introduced several small amendments to 
ensure that the staff of the Legion of Honor would still be able to proceed with their 
standard construction processes necessary to the operation and maintenance of the 
museum.   
  
 
Planning staff gave a presentation on the City Cemetery, noting that the San Francisco 
golf alliance had expressed concern over whether the landmarking would affect the 
operations of the golf course on-site, however Planning has worked with the Rec 
&Park to ensure operations of the golf course will not be affected.   
 
 
A representative from Rec & Park and a representative from the Fine Arts Museum also 
spoke at the hearing, expressing their strong support of the landmarking.
