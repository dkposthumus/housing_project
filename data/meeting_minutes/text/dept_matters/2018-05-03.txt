Aaron Starr: 
• 180086 Planning Code - Legitimization and Reestablishment of Certain Self-
Storage Uses. Sponsor: Kim. Staff Butkus 
 
 
 
On the land use agenda this weeks was an ordinance, sponsor by Supervisor Kim, to 
allow the Legitimization and Reestablishment of Certain Self-Storage Uses. This 
ordinance is being proposed to allow the Hall of Justice to store its record at a property 
that is currently uses as a self-storage facility. The ordinance would allow the building 
to revert back to that use once the city vacates the property.
