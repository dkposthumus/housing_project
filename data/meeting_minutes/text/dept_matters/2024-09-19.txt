10. DIRECTOR’S ANNOUNCEMENTS 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Congratulations, Commissioner So. I’ll just let the Commission know how we work with officers too because 
some some of you may not know is every two weeks, generally we'll have an officer's meeting, that I think have 
been successful and productive and those will continue but it's with the both the president and vice president. 
So, we look forward to continuing those to talk about what's on the agenda and how we tackle some of the 
major issues we have. So, looking forward to continuing that with Vice President Moore and with the President 
So. 
Commissioner Moore: 
So, just to support Director Hillis said the officers meetings are indeed attended by both the Vice President and 
the President. And in the end, it doesn't really matter. It is not about position, it is about participating. So I see 
the support that both officers have given in the past will continue to be equally effective. And I do appreciate 
Director Hillis’ explanation to that. So we will charge forward and do what we all need to do. Thank you.
