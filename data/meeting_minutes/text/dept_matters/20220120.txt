Director’s Announcements 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Good afternoon, Commissioners. No announcements today just congratulations President 
Tanner and Vice President Moore. I look forward to continuing to work with you. And also 
thank you to Commissioner Koppel for your leadership over the last few years that I have 
been here and before that. I know this has been an atypical couple of years and we have 
faced many unique challenges about just reopening the Department and how we keep the 
Commission meetings going and giving the public a voice and your leadership have been 
invaluable during that time. So thank you very much for your service. 
 
Commissioner Koppel: 
Thanks. 
 
 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary:

Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic 
Preservation Commission 
 
 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
 
The Historic Preservation Commission did meet yesterday. They also held their Election of 
Officers, where they elected Commissioners Matsuda and Nageswaran for a second term. 
And then the only other item that may be of interest to the Commissioners is that they 
adopted a recommendation for landmark designation of the Clay Theatre on Fillmore Street.
