Director’s Announcements 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Good afternoon, Commissioners. Just a couple of quick announcements. One, I wanted to 
let you know that we’re planning to calendar an informational hearing in early October to 
give you a presentation and data on the economic impacts of the pandemic and the City’s 
initial response to the Economic Recovery Task Force. And we’re hoping to have those 
representatives from the Controller as well as the Task Force to join us during that 
presentation. The hope is that this hearing will be a springboard for us to start discussing 
the long-term land use implications of the pandemic. I recognized that the impacts, 
especially the long-range impacts of the pandemic, are still being understood. But I think it 
is clear to all of us that the crisis will make a mark both physically and socially on the City 
that we should anticipate and respond to. So, I look forward to having that discussion with 
you. 
 
I also wanted to let you know that the state wrapped up its legislative session recently. 
And after a flurry of initial bills related to Land Use and Housing, only a few made it to the 
governor’s desk. We’re in the midst of analyzing those and we’ll report back to you either 
by a memo or a hearing in the coming weeks. And that concludes my report. Thanks.
