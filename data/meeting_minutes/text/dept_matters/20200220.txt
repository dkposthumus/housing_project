There is no report from the Board – from either board actually of Supervisors or Board of 
Appeals. The Historic Preservation Commission did meet yesterday and one item of interest 
to the Planning Commission could be the Spreckles Temple of Music, the outdoor 
auditorium, or bandshell rather, as part of the 150th anniversary celebration of Golden Gate 
Park. They are proposing some improvements to it. They are doing some maintenance work 
as well as including sort of a temporary lighting installation, so the Historic Preservation 
Commission acted approving all but one portion of the temporary installation, eliminating 
the word sign that would sit above the bandstand and they felt that would be too 
distracting.
