Director’s Announcements 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director:  
Good afternoon, Commissioners. Just quickly, you might have seen the Mayor and 
Supervisor Peskin are introducing legislation that will impact downtown in Union Square. 
Basically, to ease the ability to convert buildings from office to residential. It will mostly 
impact older buildings but getting rid of some process and hearings and easing some 
requirements also for upper floors in Union Square giving some additional flexibility for 
their use. So you’ll hear those. Those are changes to the Planning Commission. They will 
come to you for comments and recommendations. We’ll also talk about them in April 
when we’re here talking about the housing element but just wanted to flag those. 
 
 
Commissioner Moore: 
 
Good. 
 
 
 
President Tanner: 
 
Thank you. That’s great to hear.
