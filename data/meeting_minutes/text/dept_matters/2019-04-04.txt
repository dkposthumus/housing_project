Director’s Announcements 
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
Just a couple announcements. I was going to talk about the roof decks. We have talked 
about that. We will schedule a hearing on that. The second thing is that article about the 
100,000 units. I also caught light of that. I’m happy -- I think we definitely need to look at 
the methodology. I can't imagine the number is anywhere near that. That is one quarter of 
the city’s housing stock. The city has only 400,000 units in total.  
 
Commissioner Johnson: 
This is for the entire Bay Area. They corrected it. 
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
In the Bay Area? Okay, I don't know the number is for the city but okay. So, anyway we will 
look at that. Because this, that method, the methods of calculating and kind of discovering 
what units are truly vacant is a very inexact science and there has been a number of 
attempts to look at that but definitely want to look the background of this particular study. 
And thirdly, I am stunned to hear about Ms. Woods' passing. We worked with her very 
closely. She’s been on the Mission Bay CAC for many years.  She was on the advisory board
