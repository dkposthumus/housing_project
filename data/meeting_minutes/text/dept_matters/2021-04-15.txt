Director’s Announcements 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
good afternoon, commissioners. Just a couple of follow-up items. We talked about the 
number of hearings and the limitations under SB 330. We've since made, at your request, 
kind of clarifying language to director's bulletin number seven that calls out the fact that 
independent requests from project sponsors will not count against the hearing limits under 
S.B. 330, and that's our interpretation of the state code, but we've discussed that with the 
city attorney, so we've clarified that in the memo that talks about S.B. 330. And then, you 
also received two memos regarding how project sponsors in the last five years or so have 
satisfied their affordable housing obligations. One is a more general memo that looks at how 
many have satisfied their 415 obligations with on-site first off-site first other options, and 
you'll see that about 70% over the last five years have selected the on-site alternative. So, 
more than the majority of projects. And then, you also asked, as in Commissioner Diamond 
asked, how many projects have come back to the Commission to change, and all of them 
changed from on-site to fee or off-site to fee and there were approximately four projects 
over the last five years that made that selection. So those memos we sent you, and to the 
extent you have questions, please let us know. That's all I have. Thanks.
