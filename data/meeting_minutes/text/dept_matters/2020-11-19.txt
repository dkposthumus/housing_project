Director’s Announcements 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Thank you, Jonas. Thank you, Commissioners, and we will follow up on the items you 
brought up. One, thank you for those that attended our staff brown bag lunch with Bill 
Gilchrist on Monday. I think it was a productive conversation. And thank you, Commissioner 
Moore for suggesting it. Certainly, it was well received by staff.  
 
I want to let you know that Liz Watty, who I think all of you know and are familiar with her 
work, has accepted my offer to be the Director of Citywide Planning. She has been acting in 
that role. She was Acting Director -- I mean Deputy Director for seven years. She's been with 
the Department 15 years. Started actually as an intern and moved her way up to Planner I, 
II, and III and now Director. So, I'm sure you’ve recognized her work and we look forward to 
continuing to work with her. One of the first things and the current thing she's tackling and 
something she was tackling, even as Deputy Director, is expanding our services working 
with DBI, who we’re working cooperatively with to expand our permit services both in-
person to the extent that we can, and allowed by the Health Department, and online. As you 
know, our revenues continue to suffer both from the economic conditions and metering the 
allowable people being allowed into the Permit Center to file for permits. So, we will 
continue to update you and she will continue to work on that.  
 
Bridget, during the Prop H informational, may bring this up as well, but I just wanted to let 
you know that the Mayor issued an Executive Directive this morning for -- related to 
implementation of Prop H focused on the city coming together in working to meet some of
