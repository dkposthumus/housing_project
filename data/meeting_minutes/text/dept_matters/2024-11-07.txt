11. DIRECTOR’S ANNOUNCEMENTS 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Thank you. Commissioners, I was going to make the same note that we did receive that Pro Housing designation. 
It also came kind of a year and a day after the state issued the Policy and Practice Review and we’ve made great 
progress. There are a couple of items that’s still kind of remain and we can give you an update on kind of where 
things stand with the Policy and Practice Review. Also to note, Ms. Schuttish kind of brings up the Flat Policy, 
and I think she’ll bring it up today too. But I wanted to remind you, it is 1) the policy is in effect, you’ve adopted 
it. We kind of treated it as a code, But it is on our work program, will come to you as part of the rezoning work 
that actually codifying the Flat Policy. So, looking forward to that as well. Thank you. 
12. REVIEW OF PAST EVENTS AT THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, BOARD OF APPEALS AND HISTORIC PRESERVATION 
COMMISSION 
Aaron Starr, Manager of Legislative Affairs: 
Good afternoon, Commissioners Aaron Starr Manager of Legislative Affairs. 
My husband started practicing Qi Gung a couple of years ago. If you’re not familiar it’s like Tai Chi, Tai Chi is 
more martial arts based, and Qi Gong is more focused on moving energy in and around the body. 
So, energy, or Qi, has been a topic of conversation around my house a lot lately, and I’m starting to notice it 
more myself. The energy when you walk into a room and whether it has good or bad vibes, or you can tell if 
someone is tense or relaxed by the Qi they are giving off.
