Director’s Announcements 
 
 
Liz Watty, Director of Current Planning: 
Hi, Liz Watty, Director of Current Planning, acting Director while Director Hillis is out of the 
office today. We do just have one quick announcement I wanted to share with you. We 
actually have graduate students from Cal-Poly’s Master’s program in City and Regional 
Planning in the chambers today. They drove all the way up from San Luis Obispo to join us. 
Each year the Graduate Student Planning Association selects a Planning agency across 
California to give their students the opportunity to learn and hear from development 
review professionals working in the real world and this year they selected San Francisco. 
Our staff have given them an overview of our Department and Design Standards, Living 
Alleys, various local and state housing programs and how we implement them. So, they 
have gotten a little bit of a crash course from us today but we wanted to just acknowledge 
that they are in the chambers and to welcome them.
