14. DIRECTOR’S ANNOUNCEMENTS 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Just one item. You know, we're nearing the end of the state legislative session, so all bills have either passed or not 
passed out of both houses of the state legislature and are sitting on the Governor's desk. There are a couple of them

that are significant to us that relate mostly to housing, but land use items as well, and we plan to come to you in 
November with an Informational hearing as we digest them. One I wanted to note, because it was in the 
newspaper, and that was SB 423 which is an extension of SB 35. So, basically allowing for ministerial approval if 
we’re not meeting our RHNA targets, where we measure, whether we’re meeting our RHNA targets was going to 
take place in year 4 of our RHNA cycle and then year 8 of our RHNA cycle which will be 2027. That bill was amended 
so that we have to look and see how we're doing in relation to our RHNA cycles in year one. So at the end of this 
year, and if we're not meeting our goals, either market rate or affordable housing projects or both become 
ministerial. So that's a significant change. So we'll come and talk more to you about that, but just wanted to 
highlight that. And again, it's on the Governor's desk. We believe the governor will sign that. So, more to come on 
that and a couple other state bills. 
President Tanner: 
I was going to say, are there may be some other bills, but I know we routinely get an update I think as the legislative 
cycle moves forward on kind of what passes and what we might need to look forward to and get signed.  
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Yeah, we’re going to have a hearing in November that just talks about all these.  
President Tanner: 
Great. 
Commissioner Diamond: 
Director Hillis, if you could just elaborate a little bit, we have to make, meet 1/8th of the goal in year one?  
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Yeah. 
Commissioner Diamond: 
I see. 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Yeah, correct.  
Commissioner Diamond: 
And the affordable category and in the market rate.  
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Both will get looked at separately, yes. So, as you can imagine, we're not going to meet -- 
Commissioner Diamond: 
Right. 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Our RHNA goals in year one, which is, you know, 8,000 a year, so, you know, after we report to HCD, they accept 
our report that we didn't meet our RHNA goals, which will be sometime early in the spring of next year, ministerial 
approval would kick in. We've obviously got a history with that because we haven't met our affordable goals, so 
we’ve approved projects, ministerially under SB 35 for affordable projects, that'll obviously kick in for  market rate 
projects as well. There's limitations to it - you got to be creating two or more units; they can't be subject to rent 
control, the existing units, or there can't be existing units subject to rent control; can't be individually listed locally 
or on the state or National Register; there are labor provisions. So, there's details every project is not eligible for 
that we’ll come and talk to you about.

Commissioner Diamond: 
When you come back to us with a fuller report, will you be able to tell us how many applications are pending that 
this might apply to. So we have some sense as to the magnitude of the impact of this provision. Thank you. 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Sure. Yeah. 
Commissioner Moore: 
On the positive side as the discussion of adaptive reuse of office is heating up, which in the beginning, when it was 
brought up was actually not received particularly, well, would that give us a break on our housing element because 
that particular building type was not introduced as a candidate, a resource for housing anyway.  
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Yeah, I mean they'll definitely count to, towards our RHNA goals, if we create, you know, the Warfields building is 
moving forward, currently it'll create 40 units. We issued an RFI with OEWD. Responses were due this past week. 
There were ten responses, I think close to a 1,000 units where sponsors said we're interested, but we need certain 
kind of concessions from the City in order to make these projects feasible. So we're looking at that and how those 
kind of guide guide our policy decisions and land use changes or code changes in the future. So, we’ll also come 
back and talk to you about those, but those will certainly count towards our RHNA goals. Some of those projects, 
100% affordable as well which was exciting to see. So, you'll hear more about that as well. 
Commissioner Moore: 
It's a slightly most stinging question, but can we also look for financial mechanisms. I'm not talking it calling it help 
from the State as well as from the Federal Government because the housing shortage is a national problem not a - 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Yeah, yeah. 
Commissioner Moore: 
- - solely San Francisco focused problem and I would be interested to see as to whether or not we are also
entertaining discussions about financing, which is basically ultimately the stumbling stone of why we're not
moving. 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Absolutely. I mean, we're already doing that regardless of conversions figuring out how we finance and get 
resources to build the 46 thousand units of affordable housing we need to build. So, that is, you know, as we've 
talked to you in the past, it's part of our work program going forward. 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
Commissioners, I'd like to respectfully remind you this is not an agendized item and we should limit the discussion 
related to it,--  
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
But yes, that's part of our, that's part of our work program and could it apply or could there be mechanisms that 
apply to office to residential conversions separately, sure we're looking at that.  
Commissioner Moore: 
I would be interested if as a department to keep us really posted not even to schedule a special short discussion on 
it once it is agendized. 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Yeah, absolutely. Sorry Jonas.

Commissioner Moore: 
Sorry, Jonas.  It's a very burning issue and I think everybody's trying to find constructive solutions. Thank you. 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Yeah 
President Tanner: 
Great, thank you.  
15. REVIEW OF PAST EVENTS AT THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, BOARD OF APPEALS AND HISTORIC PRESERVATION 
COMMISSION
Aaron Starr, Manager of Legislative Affairs: 
Good afternoon, Commissioners. Aaron Starr Manager of Legislative Affairs.
This week the land use committee was cancelled; however, they did meet last week.
Land Use Committee
230855 Planning, Administrative Codes - Development Impact Fee Reductions. Sponsors: Peskin; Safai and
Mandelman. Staff: Grob. Forwarded
First on last week’s agenda was the duplicated file for the Development Impact Fee Reductions. The prior week, 
Supervisor Safai proposed amendments to the ordinance that would allow pipeline projects between 10-24
units and those under HOME SF to receive the inclusionary rate reduction. The item passed out off committee
without recommendation on a unanimous vote.
230880 Initiating Landmark Designation Amendment - San Francisco Fire Station No. 44. Sponsor: Walton.
Staff: TBD. Recommended
The committee also considered a resolution initiating landmark designation for San Francisco Fire Station No.
44. The station is located 1298 Girard Street in District 10, Supervisor Walton’s District who is also the sponsor.
A few speakers called in to support the resolution. The item was then forwarded to the Full Board with a positive 
recommendation. This initiation just starts the designation process, as the item still needs to be reviewed and
acted upon by the HPC.
230922 Planning Code - Landmark Designation - Colombo Market Arch. Sponsor: Peskin. Staff: LaValley. 
Recommended 
Next on the agenda was the landmark designation of the Colombo Market Arch. Located at 600 Front Street. 
The arch is the last remaining remnant of the building that used to house the Colombo Market, which was 
eventually torn down as part of the redevelopment of the Embarcadero. During the hearing, Supervisor Pekin, 
who is the sponsor, praised the designation report, and said how much he enjoyed reading it and that he 
learned new a lot from the report. There were a few speakers who called in to express support of the 
designation, and after closing comments from Supervisor Peskin the item was unanimously referred to the Full 
Board with a positive recommendation.  
230446 Planning Code, Zoning Map - Housing Production. Sponsors: Mayor; Engardio and Dorsey. Staff: Starr. 
Continued to 10/02/23 
Finally, the Committee considered the mayor’s Constraint’s Reduction ordinance. Commissioners, you 
considered this item in June of this year and voted to recommend approval with modifications. Those

Meeting Minutes 
Page 9 of 13 
modifications included adding a tenant buy-out provision to the eligibility list to be exempt from Demo CUs, 
and language to maintain 15’ setback when there is a predominate street pattern of 15’ setbacks. 
The mayor’s office did take all the Planning Commission recommended modifications and had a set of 
proposed modifications to introduce at the land use hearing. They included items like maintaining the CU for 
large lot developments in Priority Equity Geographies and expanding the PEG SUD to include all of Calle 24. 
Planning Staff read these into the record; however, the Committee did not take a vote to accept the 
modifications, saying they needed more time to review and understand them. 
The mayor’s office did not send a representative to the hearing, and instead relied on Planning Staff to answer 
questions about the proposed ordinance. Questions from the Committee members were intense at times, and 
mainly focused on how the mayor’s office plans to build the 42,000 affordable housing units called for in our 
RINA goals, and how this ordinance helped advance affordable housing. Committee members, specifically 
Peskin and Preston, took exception to the fact that the mayor did not send a representative to the hearing. 
There were almost no questions about what the ordinance did, nor were there any questions about how the 
ordinance helped fulfill our obligations under the Housing Element. 
As you might have guessed, public comment was also lengthy and contentious. Many of the commentators 
were misinformed about what the ordinance did, as evidenced by their claims that the ordinance would 
demolish thousands of rent controlled buildings and lead to mass displacement. Those that supported the 
ordinance spoke about our obligations under state law and that this ordinance would remove bureaucratic 
barriers to housing production.  
After several hours of questions and public comment, the committee voted to continue the item to October 2. 
Full Board past two weeks.  
230817 Interim Zoning Controls - Extending and Modifying Conditional Use Authorization Requirement for 
Parcel Delivery Service Uses. Sponsor: Dorsey. Staff: V. Flores. Adopted 
230856 Mayoral Appointment, Historic Preservation Commission - Hans Baldauf. Sponsor: Mayor. Staff: Ionin. 
Adopted 
230922 Planning Code - Landmark Designation - Colombo Market Arch. Sponsor: Peskin. Staff: LaValley. Passed 
First Read 
230880 Initiating Landmark Designation Amendment - San Francisco Fire Station No. 44. Sponsor: Walton. 
Staff: TBD. Adopted 
230855 Planning, Administrative Codes - Development Impact Fee Reductions. Sponsors: Peskin; Safai and 
Mandelman. Staff: Grob. Passed First Read.  
Commissioner Diamond: 
I read in the paper as many of you did with horror about the public comment section at the Board of Supervisors 
where people were calling in with racist and anti- sematic comments and with the board president Peskin saying 
it had to stop and he was gonna reconsider to some extent, the use of the public comment section as a forum for 
those who are abusing it, which sadly would affect everybody and I wondered whether that, you know, that 
exploration will have an impact on call-ins at the Planning Commission hearings, what the status of that is. And I 
don’t know, whether who, to whom to direct that question.

Jonas P. Ionin, Commissions Secretary: 
Commissioner Diamond, if the board elects to modify its public remote public comment opportunities that avail 
themselves, it would not impact us unless they passed some sort of legislation that would encompass all 
commissions and policy bodies throughout San Francisco. But we make up our rules as far as public comment is 
concerned. 
Commissioner Diamond: 
Fortunately, we have not been subject to those kinds of comments and I certainly hope it continues along that 
path. I just didn't know what he was exploring as a, you know, a rule that would apply to all public hearings or just 
limited to the board of Supervisors. 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commissions Secretary: 
Right. 
Commissioner Moore: 
I unfortunately heard that this is happening in all other surrounding communities, including all the way down to 
San Diego and Los Angeles, and I hope we will not be having to focus on that, but I think ultimately, we would have 
to talk to our city attorney because somebody weighed in that it may go against free speech. I personally would 
weigh in on where you are but it’s a very serious issue. 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commissions Secretary: 
I mean, knock on wood, I'm quite shocked that we have been so fortunate.
