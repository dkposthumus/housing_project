Directorâ€™s Announcements 
 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Good afternoon Commissioners. Just two announcements, one I just wanted to let you all 
know we are officially back in the office next week starting November 1st so that's when we 
start with our staff being in the office at least two days a week and possibly three days 
remote but it's our first time fully occupying 49 South Van Ness so we are looking forward 
to that.
