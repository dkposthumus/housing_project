Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic 
Preservation Commission 
 
 
Aaron Starr: 
At Land Use this week, Supervisor Ronen’s ordinance that would amend the UMU Districts 
was continued to the call of the Chair. At the Full Board this week, Supervisor Peskin's

Mandelman’s ordinance that would require conditional use authorization for projects that 
are demonstrably unaffordable passed its first read. And that concludes my report. Thank 
you.
