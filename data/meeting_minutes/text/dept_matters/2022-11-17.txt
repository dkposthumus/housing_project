Aaron Starr, Manager of Legislative Affairs:
Good afternoon, Commissioner’s, Aaron Starr Manager of Legislative Affairs
Land Use
This week the Planning Commission considered an ordinance introduced by Supervisor
Safai that would allow long-term parking of and overnight camping in vehicles on parcels
designated and authorized for use as Vehicle Triage Centers (VTC) or Safe Parking Program
sites.
The Ordinance also makes minor amendments related to Cannabis Retail deadlines.
You heard this item on July 21st and unanimously recommend approval.
At the land use hearing, Supervisor Melgar inquired about how many applications were
left in the pipeline and how long these applications would take to review. The Supervisor
also expressed concerned that they’ve heard this before. The Office of Cannabis clarified
there are 35 applications left in the queue and that it has taken longer to review these
applications than anticipated. The Office of Cannabis clarified that they only recently
cleared the backlog of equity applications and now able to focus on these 35. They hope to
complete review of these by the time the legislation takes effect.
There were no public comments and the committee moved it to the Full Board with
positive recommendation.
Full Board
At the Full Board this week, the Board held a committee of the whole on the Housing
Element Update. This was only a hearing, and no action was proposed.
The presentation was led by Director Hillis and Miriam Chion, with other staff available to
respond to comments and questions. The Supervisors used the opportunity to provide
input on the draft and express frustration with the process.
