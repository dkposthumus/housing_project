Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic 
Preservation Commission 
 
Jonas P. Ionin. Commission Secretary: 
Aaron Starr is out sick so he asked me to relay to you only that the CEQA appeal for 344 14th 
Street was denied and the CPE was upheld at the Board yesterday. He'll give you a full report 
next week. I will also simply announce that, well, there's no report from the Board of Appeals 
and the Historic Preservation Commission didn't meet yesterday. But just to inform you that 
the mayor has nominated Sue Diamond to fill the vacancy here on the Planning Commission.
