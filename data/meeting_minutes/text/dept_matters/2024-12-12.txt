12. REVIEW OF PAST EVENTS AT THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, BOARD OF APPEALS AND HISTORIC PRESERVATION 
COMMISSION 
Aaron Starr, Manager of Legislative Affairs: 
Good afternoon Commissioners, Aaron Starr Manager of Legislative Affairs. 
Like you, the land use committee had their last meeting of the year this week, and also the last land use 
committee for Supervisors Peskin and Preston.  
241055 Building, Planning Codes - Code Corrections and Updates. Sponsor: Planning Commission. Staff: 
Starr.  
The first item was this commissions’ code corrections ordinance. Commissioners you heard this item on 
September 19 and voted to recommend approval with modifications. All but one of the proposed 
modifications were additional clean-up items, and they were all added to a revised ordinance prior to 
transmittal to the Clerk’s office. The one amendment not added was suggested at the last minute by a 
member of the public. It dealt with allowable uses in conjunction with Self Storage in the PDR-2 zoning. This 
commission stated that they were not opposed to the amendment but that the language needed to be 
worked out with staff. You then left it up to the Land Use Committee to integrate the amendment at the 
committee hearing. 
During the hearing, Supervisor Peskin stated that he wanted to add the amendments. To accommodate this 
and to allow for the original ordinance to move forward, Peskin duplicated the ordinance and amended it. 
The original file was then forwarded to the Full Board with a positive recommendation as a committee 
report.
