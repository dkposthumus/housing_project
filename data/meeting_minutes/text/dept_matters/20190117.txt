Director’s Announcements 
 
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
Congratulations to the new President and Vice President. And thank you, both, for your 
service and we look forward to working with you.  And Commissioner Hillis, you are 
certainly welcome to join us for the biweekly meetings still in my office if you’d like.  
 
Last week you’ve heard a number of people testify about a project on 47th Avenue, 1295 
47th Avenue. Where there was a concern about a DR that had been potentially rejected by 
the Zoning Administrator and I just wanted to get back to you on that to clear up what 
actually happened. This project was an ADU, which does not require notification, of course. 
And the tenant became aware of the permit back in June of '18 and was aware of the 
proposed ADU and that work being done on the project. We informed them of the process 
for DR’s but the actual DR was not filed until the Department had already approved the 
permit. So it was, you know, and per our procedures and per the code, once the permit is 
approved, it's no longer possible to actually file the DR. So I think there was a 
misunderstanding about the timing and in this case I don't understand exactly why the 
staff says they actually hadn't informed the tenant and their attorney on this. But in this 
case it was simply after the permit was already approved. And I will remind you that 
subsequent to -- I think it was last fall -- I can't remember exactly when we added a 
procedure if you might recall that requires building owners to inform tenants when they're 
putting in an ADU, that they have to inform them if the ADU would be in a space that the 
tenant uses for parking or storage or laundry, or something of that facility. So that 
procedure went into place after this particular project went forward. So I just wanted to 
clear that situation up. Thank you for your time and happy to answer any questions.   
 
President Melgar: 
Thank you, Director. We were all wondering about that.

This week, the land use Committee considered the rezoning and associated General 
Plan Amendments for 1650-1680 Mission Street. The ordinance would rezone the 
subject properties to C-3-G and make corresponding changes to the Downtown Plan 
and the Market and Octavia Plan. Commissioners, you heard these items on October 25 
of last year and voted to approve the proposed amendments.  
 
At the Land Use hearing, Sue Hestor was the only public commenter and brought up 
the same concerns she expressed at the Planning Commissions hearing. Mainly that 
DBI could approve tenant improvements to the subject site not knowing that a change 
of use is needed. As a result, the new property owners would not be charged impact 
fees. As discussed at the Planning Commission hearing and reiterated at the 
Committee hearing, the property owners are still required to seek a change of use 
application to establish a General Office use, and that change of use does trigger 
certain impact fees. Supervisor Peskin made a motion to put an uncodified provision in 
this ordinance that would memorialize that changes of use on this property are subject 
to impact fees. This amendment was taken unanimously, and the items were then 
forwarded to the Full Board as a committee report.

Lastly the land use committee heard the proposed changes to the C-3-R District. This 
item was continued from last week so that certain amendments could be drafted and 
added to the legislation. The amendments related to proposed CU findings that would 
allow non-retail uses on the 3rd floor. Supervisor Safai had some questions about why 
retail was not desirable on the third floor, and representatives of the Unions Square 
area gave public comment in support of the proposed amendments. The Committee 
then forwarded the item to the Full Board with recommendation.

The Board then considered the CEQA Appeal for the project at 84 Page Street. This is a 
school playfield project. One of the neighboring residents appealed the CatEx for this 
project on the grounds of school-children related noise impacts. At the hearing, the 
appellant went so far as to play a sound recording of children playing outdoors to 
make his point. In Supervisor Brown’s opening statement, she stated that the sound of 
children playing outdoors makes her happy. Staff gave their usual cogent defense of 
the Departments rational for the CEQA determination, and two elementary school 
children made a moving speech in support of the playfield. The hearing was short, and 
in the end the CatEx determination was upheld unanimously.  
 
• 
181200 Hearing - Appeal of Determination of Exemption From Environmental Review - 
11 Gladys Street. 3:00 PM Special Order, Items 59-62. Staff:  
 
Next the Board considered the appeal for 11 Gladys Street. This project proposes a 
modest vertical addition to a small house in Bernal Heights. One of the neighbors 
appealed the CatEx on the grounds of geotechnical and archeological impacts; 
however, it soon became apparent that the main concern was the loss of the 
appellant’s views because of the development. The district supervisor Hilary Ronen 
noted in her remarks that her office did try to settle the appeal by getting the affected 
parties to discuss a potential resolution, but with no success. In the end the CatEx 
determination was upheld unanimously.

Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
There is no report from the Board of Appeals. The Historic Preservation Commission did 
meet yesterday and considered -- the Architectural Review Committee considered the 
replacement of the Path of Gold lights as well as the Better Market Street plan being 
proposed by the Department of Public Works. They also held their elections yesterday 
where Commissioner Highland was elected President and Commissioner Matsuda was 
elected Vice President. They also initiated Landmark Designation for the property at 2851 
through 2861 24th Street.

Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
There was some opposition from the property owners, but I think when they speak with 
staff and get a better sense of their path forward, they may be ok with that. I will also 
mention that there were three Legacy Businesses that were considered and recommended 
for as legacy businesses. And my personal favorite bakery, Schubert’s, was one of them.
