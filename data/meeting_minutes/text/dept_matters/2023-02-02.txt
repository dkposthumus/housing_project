This week, the Land Use Committee heard the long-awaited Article 8 Reorg that includes 
many other substantiative changes, which is sponsored by Supervisor Dorsey. The 
Planning Commission heard this item on November 17 and voted to recommend approval 
with modifications. Those modifications included: 
1. Exempt Childcare Facilities and Residential Care Facilities from FAR limits in those 
zoning districts.  
2. Remove the language referencing adequate lighting and the Planning Department’s 
lighting guidelines from the definition of Walk-Up Facility.
