Director’s Announcements
Rich Hillis, Planning Director:
Just on the Housing Element to follow up. You may have read in the paper that we did get
certified but we did have a project come in to attempt the builder’s revenue project. It was
the one you’ve heard in the past, on 17th Street, but we had a certified Housing Element so
builder’s remedy was not relevant. And we we’re only one of only a handful of jurisdictions
in the Bay Area that did get certified in time so thank you all for adapting and modifying
the timeline, and for your leadership on this. So, thank you.
