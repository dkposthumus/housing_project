Good afternoon, commissioners. Aaron Starr manager of Legislative Affairs 
Land Use Committee  
 
240263 Planning Code - Divisadero Street Neighborhood Commercial Transit District. Sponsor: Preston. 
Staff: V. Flores. 
 
The week the Land Use Committee considered Supervisor Preston’s ordinance that would amend the 
Planning Code to permit liquor stores in buildings with off-street parking accessed on Broderick Street 
within the Divisadero Street Neighborhood Commercial Transit District (NCT). As you likely recall this is 
intended to help the mixed use complect that houses Falletti’s grocery store.
