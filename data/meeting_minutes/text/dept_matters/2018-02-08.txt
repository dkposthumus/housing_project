Director’s Announcements 
 
Director John Rahaim: 
Commissioners, I was going to call to your attention this memo that AnMarie and Josh 
Switzky wrote. You just received it today and I would encourage you to read it.  It’s a very 
thorough analysis of the effects of potential effects of SB-827 as it's currently written and if 
you would like to have a hearing in the future, we're happy to schedule that in a 
reasonable timeframe, so let us know if you want to do that.  
 
President Hillis: 
Yeah, I think we would.
