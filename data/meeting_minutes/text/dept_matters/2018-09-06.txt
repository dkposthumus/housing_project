Director’s Announcements 
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
Just a couple of things Commissioners - next week is the Global Climate Summit here in 
San Francisco that is being convened by Governor Brown. I think that Mayor Breed's 
announcement is related to that and as well as other items. There are a number of events 
that are happening that are kind of peripheral to that conference and, the conference itself 
is actually by invitation-only, but it will be several thousand people in town talking about 
these issues at a very high level. So and I know that the Department of Environment and 
Mayor’s office have been very much involved in helping to organize those events, so we're 
looking forward to seeing the outcome of that. Secondly, Commissioner Richards, it's 
funny that you mentioned those three P’s, if you will. You may recall that last year as a 
result of the last Bay planned Bay Area, the MTC and ABAG staffs convened a regional 
working group on housing and it's called CASA. By the way, it does not stand for anything, 
that's just the name of the group. And those are the three terms that they’ve used as a 
basis for their discussions, as the goals of that effort, which were to protect existing 
residents and preserve existing affordable housing and produce housing. So that's exactly 
the same mantra they're using in their work regionally and the results of that work are 
coming out, I think, later this fall. And I was going to talk to President Hillis about 
scheduling a hearing on it, because I think it would be really important for the Commission 
to hear the results and the recommendation from that regional group.
