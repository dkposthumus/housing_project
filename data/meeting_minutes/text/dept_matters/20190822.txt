Directorâ€™s Announcements 
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
Commissioners, welcome back from your break and I will just apologize to everyone for the 
heat. The air-conditioning on this half of the building hasn't been working all week. So, we 
will try to muddle through this other than that, I have no further comments. Thank you.

Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic 
Preservation Commission 
 
 
 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
There is no report from the Board of Supervisors or the Board of Appeals. The one item of 
interest that may be to the Planning Commission that was brought up at yesterday's hearing 
in front of the Historic Preservation Commission was they reviewed and commented on the 
Board of Education action regarding the George Washington High School murals. 
Specifically, on The Life of George Washington section of the murals. There was some 
consensus by the Commission that they should not be covered up, but the Board of 
Education actually recently not reversed its ruling, but instead of whitewashing over the 
murals to permanently obscure them from view. They decided to simply hang something 
over them so that they were obscured from view. I don't believe this issue is over, though, 
just yet.
