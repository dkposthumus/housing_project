Aaron Starr: 
Next the Committee considered Amendments to the Central SoMa Plan, continued from 
the July 23rd Land Use hearing. This commission heard these amendments to the Plan on 
September 27th and voted unanimously to approve the amendments with modifications.  
 
At the Land Use Committee there were about 20 public comments covering a range of 
topics, including:  
 
• 
Support for restoring funding for the Old Mint at $20mn;  
• 
Calls for additional anti-displacement policies for residents, small businesses, and non-
profits, both within the Plan and more broadly;  
• 
A desire for a greater quantity and more accessible open spaces, including requests 
that future open spaces serve youth and families; and  
• 
Feedback from SF Flower Mart vendors who oppose seeing residential development 
on the site due to potential conflicts with their operations.  
 
Following that, Supervisor Kim responded to some of the public comments, describing 
potential ways of increasing affordable housing, including evaluating the existing Jobs-
Housing Linkage Fee and considering legalization of live-work lofts. She introduced several 
amendments that included most of the Planning Commission recommendations and 
indicated there would be additional amendments at the next hearing on October 15th. The 
Committee then voted to approve the additional amendments and to continue the Plan to 
the next hearing on 10/15.
