Preservation Commission 
 
 
Aaron Starr, Manager of Legislative Affairs: 
Land Use Committee 
230690 Planning Code - Landmark Designation - Parkside Branch Library. Sponsor: 
Engardio. Staff: La Valley.  
First on the land use agenda was the landmark designation for Parkside Branch Library 
located at 1200 Taraval Street. This landmark designation was initiated by Supervisor Mar 
last December, and once Supervisor Edgardio took office he assumed sponsorship. The 
HPC heard this item on 5/17/23 and unanimously recommended approval. 
 
Parkside Branch Library was constructed in 1951 as the prototype for the focused building 
campaign of modern branch libraries, consisting of eight buildings constructed between 
1951 and 1966. Parkside Branch Library is historically significant for its association with the 
social and cultural shifts in post-war American library programing and design. It is also 
architecturally significant as it embodies the principles of mid-twentieth century American 
public library design; displays a signature and innovative style developed by Appleton & 
Wolfard and is representative of the work of Appleton & Wolfard, an architectural firm of 
merit. 
 
The Committee voted unanimously to forward the item to the full board with a positive 
recommendation and Supervisor Peskin signed on as cosponsor to the item. 
230732 Planning and Building Codes - Commercial to Residential Adaptive Reuse and 
Downtown Economic Revitalization. Sponsors: Mayor; Peskin. Staff: Langlois.  
Next on the agenda was the amended version of the Commercial to Residential Adaptive 
Reuses for Downtown Revitalization. This commission heard the item on 7/13 and 
recommended unanimous approval.
