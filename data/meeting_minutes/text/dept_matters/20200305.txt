Aaron Starr: 
This week's Land Use Committee heard the Interim Length Occupancies or ILO ordinance 
again. The ILO ordinance proposes to regulate occupancies and dwelling units between 30 
and 365 days. Commissioners, you heard this item twice, but acted on January 30th when 
you voted unanimously to recommend approval with modifications. Those modifications 
include enacting interim controls on new ILOs, collecting data on the scale and location of 
ILO activity and clarifying admin code amendments around the exemptions for nonprofit 
organizations. Monday was the second time that the ordinance was heard at the Land Use 
Committee. This week at the beginning of the hearing, Supervisor Peskin announced 
another continuance to provide time for him to meet with representatives from the ILO 
industry and tenant advocates. He also invited Planning staff to comment during the 
hearing. Staff used the opportunity to reiterate the Commission’s recommendations and 
staff’s concerns over some of the still unanswered questions in the revised ordinance. After 
those comments, Supervisor Peskin moved to continue the hearing to March 9th. At the 
Full Board this week, the ordinance that would amend bay windows and horizontal 
projections that was sponsored by the Planning Commission passed its first read. And the 
appeal for the environmental termination of 1531-1581 Howard Street was continued to 
April 14th. That's all I have for you today.  Thanks.
