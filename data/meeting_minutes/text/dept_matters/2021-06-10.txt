Directorâ€™s Announcements 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Good afternoon, Commissioners. A couple of items for you. One, I just wanted to advise 
you that we've had two meetings now with the Equity Council, which is advising us, the 
staff, on implementation of the resolution you passed, as well as our priorities in Equity 
Plan. I've had good conversations that the meetings so far have been more introductory 
and getting to know each other in what we all do, as well as kind of setting priorities where 
the council wants to address. What their priorities are to take on and those are Housing 
and Budget in our work priorities, etc. So, we'll come talk to you more and give you 
briefings as we move forward. Also, I wanted to let you know that July 1 is when we'll 
expand services at the Permit Center at 49 South Van Ness. We'll be eliminating 
appointments with DBI and going back to the open Permit Center that we had pre-Covid. I 
also wanted to let you know that our Current Planning team is meeting with DBI and their 
inspection staff to brief them on issues around and our rules around tantamount to 
demolition. So I want to thank our Planning team for taking that on and kind of bridging 
us and DBI on our various rules around demolition. And then, I just wanted to let you 
know, we don't have any additional information. We've seen a lot on re-opening, but no 
new guidance on when we are able to go back to City Hall for live meetings. We anticipate 
that to be sometime in the fall, but that's subject to change and we'll keep you updated on 
that. And that's all I have.
