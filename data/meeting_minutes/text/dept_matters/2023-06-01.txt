Directorâ€™s Announcements
Rich Hillis, Planning Director:
Good afternoon, Commissioners. Just want to mention, if you didn't see it in the papers,
Sarah Dennis Phillips, who was with the Planning Department and then with Economic
Development, and you've seen her here representing Tishman in projects they have in the
city, has rejoined the City as the head of Economic Development. So, we're excited to have
her back in the City and I'm sure she'll be here to talk with us about efforts, especially
Downtown, which I know will be one of her priorities leading the Department. So, just 
wanted to make you aware of that. The mayor also introduced our budget yesterday and
we will have hearings at the board starting the week of the 12th. They'll look at the budget
for those next two weeks and then adopt it by the end of the month. So, we'll keep you
posted on any changes to our budget. Thanks.
President Tanner:
Great. That did remind me of just one thing I wanted to say, which is to complement the
staff and all those who participated in the advisory services panel. Did I get that right?
