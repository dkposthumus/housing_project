Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic 
Preservation Commission 
 
 
Aaron Starr, Manager of Legislative Affairs: 
Good afternoon Commissioners. The Board was off this week because of President’s Day, 
but they did meet last week while you were on break. At last week’s Land Use Committee 
entertained the technical corrections and amendments to various Central South of Market 
Area Zoning provisions. However, the item was continued to the call of the Chair so that 
staff could have more time to brief the Land Use Committee.  
 
At the Full Board last week, they considered a 6-month retractive extension for the 
Planning Commission’s ordinance that would allow temporary uses of hotels and motels 
for permanent supportive housing. This is preceded by a clerical procedure just to give 
more time for the author to do public outreach. However, the item was continued until 
February 23rd of this year over disagreement by its necessity and the merits or the 
ordinance expressed by Supervisor Peskin. And then also there were two 90-day 
extensions for the Historic Preservation Commission to review initiations. The first was for 
the landmark status at 447 Battery Street and the second one was for 1 Montgomery 
Street. And that is all I have for you today.    
 
 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
Thank you, Mr. Starr. I did not receive a report for the Board of Appeals. However, the 
Historic Preservation Commission did meet yesterday and they had a short but -- 
conversation regarding the San Francisco Unified School District’s school renaming effort 
and directed staff to draft a letter on their behalf, addressed to the San Francisco Unified 

San Francisco Planning Commission
