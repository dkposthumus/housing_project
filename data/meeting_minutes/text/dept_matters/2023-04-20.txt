Director’s Announcements 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
I think we’ve covered everything. Just the one other point which is Housing Element 
implementation related as we had a meeting last night about the site permit process. It 
was a public meeting to get input from customers, users, of our permitting process. We 
hosted it with DBI. Ms. Watty and Mr. Christiansen kind of led the charge in answering 
questions and talking about potential reforms to our site permit process. So well received. 
We got good feedback and you’re going to hear the [inaudible] in our joint meeting with 
DBI. If I can also add, if we can also adjourn today’s meeting in honor of Eleanor Johns who 
passed away recently too. She was Mayor Brown’s Chief of Staff for decades, both in 
Sacramento and here at City Hall, and also was the wife of Richard Johns who is a 
Commissioner on the Historic Preservation Commission.    
 
Commissioner Diamond: 
And also chair at the Airport Land Use Commission.
