Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic 
Preservation Commission 
 
 
Aaron Starr, Manager of Legislative Affairs: 
 
Good afternoon, commissioners, this week the Board met for the first time to swear in its 
recently elected members and to elect a Board President. 
 
 
I’m sure you all are aware that Supervisor Peskin was eventually voted in as president after 
several rounds of voting. Supervisor Peskin’s office is now in the process of making 
committee assignments, which should be announced at the end of the week or early next 
week.  
 
 
The Board also met on Tuesday for a regular legislative session; however, there were no 
planning items. The Land Use Committee did not meet this week. The Board and the land 
use committee are not meeting next week in honor of Martin Luther King Day.
