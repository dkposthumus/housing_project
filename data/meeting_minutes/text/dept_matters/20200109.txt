Director’s Announcements 
 
 
John Rahaim – Planning Director: 
Commissioners, happy new year to you all. It’s good to see you back.  Hope you had a great 
break. The one thing that the new year has greeted us with is a new version of SB50, as you 
saw in the newspapers. I just received a copy yesterday, so we will plow through that. The 
biggest change seems to be that the new version of the bill is allowing for a local option of 
meeting comparable density as would be allowed in SB50. How that is laid out in specifics is 
still to be determined. They haven't laid out exactly what that means. It appears to allow 
local jurisdictions up to two years to provide comparable plans and densities that would be 
comparable to what would be per required under SB50. So, we will plow through that and 
try to get that to you in the next few weeks. And that is my only comment today.
