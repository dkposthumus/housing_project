Director’s Announcements 
 
Director John Rahaim: 
I just wanted to give you a good news announcement today about one of our staff who 
received an award recently. Allison Albericci is one of our architects on staff and Allison 
received the 2018 AIA Young Architects award this year. This is an award given annually to 
individuals who have been licensed less than 10 years and who have demonstrated 
exceptional leadership and made contributions to the profession early in their careers. 
Allison has been with us about a year now. She has worked in a number of other locations 
as well and we're very pleased that the AIA has recognized her contributions. We wanted 
to publicly acknowledge and congratulate Allison on the award. Thank you.

Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic 
Preservation Commission 
 
LAND USE COMMITTEE:  
•  161109 Planning Code, Zoning Map - Establishment of Geary-Masonic Special 
Use District. Sponsor: Stefani, Safai. Staff: May.  
 
First at the land use committee last week was the Geary-Masonic Special Use 
District. As you may recall this item was continued from the previous committee 
meeting because substantive amendments were made to the ordinance, which 
were recommended by this commission. At the hearing, two people spoke in 
favor of the item during public comment. After public comment the committee 
voted to forward the item to the Full Board with a positive recommendation.
