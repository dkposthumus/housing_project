Directorâ€™s Announcements 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Thank you, Jonas. Good afternoon, Commissioners. I just wanted to take a moment during 
this meeting to recognize, celebrate, and thank Delvin Washington who is joining us today. 
Who is actually retiring this week. He's retiring tomorrow after 24 years of service with the 
department. Delvin joined in 1997 which may not seem like a long time, but if you look at 
the issues of the day, I think we were deferring blockbusters in the proliferation of video 
stores then so a lot has happened. He soon became team leader and had been leading the 

San Francisco Planning Commission
