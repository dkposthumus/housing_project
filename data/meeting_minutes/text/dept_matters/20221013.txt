Director’s Announcements 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Commissioners, I just wanted to make you aware and some of you are aware because 
we’ve spoken to you about a potential change to our schedule to adopt the Housing 
Element. And we will have this on calendar next week so we can have a back and forth on 
it because it could be fairly significant. The change we need to make in our schedule. Just a 
quick summary, we, the Housing Element is due to the state by January 31st but there is a 
grace period built into the code of 120 days which we've been working under the 
assumption that if we have until May 31st to submit our Housing Element, we would not be 
out of compliance during that grace period. We’ve received, just last week a clarification 
from HCD who has been very much aware of our schedules throughout this entire process. 
That that may not be correct, that we may be out of compliance come January 31st if we do 
not have an approved Housing Element. And we don't want to be out of compliance 
because it could jeopardize potential funding sources that the state has around housing or 
transportation. It could also lead to projects being submitted under what's called the 
Builder's Remedy where zoning wouldn't necessarily, we wouldn't take into account our 
current zoning, and we can talk more about this next week. But I just wanted to give you a 
heads up. There's been some media coverage about it in the Examiner and the Business 
Times. So, we will come talk to you and we will calendar this next week.
