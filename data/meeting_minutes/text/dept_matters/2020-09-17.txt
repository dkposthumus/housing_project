200673 Planning Code - Conversion of Certain Limited Restaurants to Restaurants 
- North Beach Neighborhood Special Use District.  
Sponsor: Peskin. Staff: Malone/Starr Item 3 
First on the Land Use agenda was Supervisor Peskin’s ordinance that would allow 
Limited Restaurants in the North Beach SUD to convert to Restaurants. 
Commissioners you heard this item on August 27 and voted to recommend 
approval with modifications. Last week the bulk of those modifications were 
added to the ordinance, but because the amendments were deemed substantive 
the item was continued one week. This week there was no public comment and 
after some brief remarks on the amendments from the City Attorney’s office, the 
item was unanimously recommended to the Full Board and forwarded as a 
Committee Report.  
• 
200852 Planning Code, Zoning Map - Rezone Certain Industrial Parcels.  
Sponsor: Planning Commission. Staff: D. Sanchez. 
Next the Committee considered an ordinance that this body sponsored. Known as 
the Rezoning Certain Industrial Parcels Ordinance, this ordinance re-zones various 
M-1 and M-2 parcels to primarily PDR.  These parcels largely in the industrial heart 
of District 10 and were left out of other larger past rezoning efforts. The 
Department sought to rezone them because the M-1 and M-2 zoning districts are 
outdated zoning designations that don’t adequately protect our industrial zoned 
land.
