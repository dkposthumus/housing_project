Director’s Announcements 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Good afternoon, commissioners. I just wanted to bring one item to your attention in case 
you did not hear about it. The Mayor proposed an initiative ordinance that will be on the 
ballot on November 3rd that makes changes to our Neighborhood Commercial District 
Zoning Controls and Procedures. So it does a host of things, but three I wanted to note – 
one requires us to act within -- actually, it is targeted and approved or act on these items 
within 30 days when they are submitted to the City; it eliminates neighborhood 
notification for principally permitted uses in some corridors; and then it converts some 
uses from conditionally -- from conditional uses to principally permitted arts activities, 
social services and philanthropic facilities, general entertainment, movie theater, 
community facilities, restaurants, and limited restaurants. Because it is a ballot initiative, 
we can only provide factual information to you and the public on this, we will work with 
the city attorney to the extent we have a summary of the ordinance. We can submit it to 
you. We will pass along the full text as well. Thank you. That concludes my report.
