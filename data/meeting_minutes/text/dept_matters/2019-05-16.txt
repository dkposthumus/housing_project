Aaron Starr: 
Land Use Committee  
• 181153 Planning Code - Regional Commercial and Folsom Street Neighborhood 
Commercial Transit Districts, Arts Activities and Nighttime Entertainment Uses. 
Sponsor: Haney. Staff: D. Sanchez  
 
This week, the Land Use committee heard Supervisor Haney’s ordinance that amends Arts 
and Entertainment use controls in the RCD and Folsom Street NCD. The Ordinance 
originally proposed to make all Arts Activities and Nighttime Entertainment as principally 
permitted uses in historic buildings in the RCD zoning district. This Ordinance was heard at 
the HPC on February 6, and then at Planning Commission on February 21. Both 
Commissions recommended approval with modification. Those modifications include:  
 
1. Allow Arts Activities throughout the RCD district.  
2. Conditionally permit Nighttime Entertainment uses within the RCD in historic 
buildings, including those that contribute to a historic district.  
3. Require a Preservation, Rehabilitation and Maintenance Plan for buildings with 
those uses within the Folsom Street NCT and RCD districts.
