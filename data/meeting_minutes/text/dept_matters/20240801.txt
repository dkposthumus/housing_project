want to appreciate and thank you for how respectful you've been of staff. Staff has a lot on their plates, and I 
can tell you from the, like, most sincere place that staff really appreciates, the kindness and the effort with which 
you reach out to them individually, such so that they're not put on the spot so that they can prepare thoughtful 
responses to the very valid and thoughtful questions that you've brought up. So, I really wanted to thank you 
for that. We also always know, as a result of that that you actually read our packets because sometimes it feels 
like we spend a lot of time writing things that no one ever reads, so we always know that with you, I know that 
you have gotten all the way through them and you know everything that's in there. So, I think that's really 
meaningful also to staff.  
And last lastly, on sort of a personal note, it's been really meaningful to me how much it's clear that you really 
care about good government. We may disagree on policy matters from time to time, but you really do always 
bring us back and hold us accountable for being, sort of good, good governance and really caring about our 
customers and the citizens of San Francisco's experience working with us. And so that's something that's very 
near and dear to my heart. And so I appreciate how much you bring it back to that and remind us of how, how 
important that is. So for all of that, we will miss you, your shoes are too, too big to be filled, and you will be 
missed, but also an exciting chapter, for you to enjoy your grandbabies. 
President Diamond: 
Thank you for those wonderful comments. I will say, I know that every Commissioner up here reads the staff 
reports. I'm just the biggest. I'm just the biggest nudge.  
Elizabeth Watty, Director of Current Planning: 
We know you read our staff reports, so we appreciate that. And then and then lastly, Sean, welcome. We're 
really excited to have you as well, Commissioner McGarry, and clearly, you've got big shoes to fill here. So we're 
really excited to work with you in this next phase. When one when one door closes, another opens. So welcome. 
And then just to follow up on Commissioner Imperial's request, I have not been in the loop on the exact schedule, 
but I will for sure relay it back to the housing choice team and relay your request for a September hearing. Sure.
