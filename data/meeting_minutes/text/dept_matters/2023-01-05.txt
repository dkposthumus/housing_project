Director’s Announcements
Rich Hillis, Planning Director:
Good afternoon, Commissioners, and happy new year. Welcome back. Hope you enjoyed 
your break. Two quick updates. First, on the Citywide Cultural Resources Survey work that
we are undertaking. I just want to let you know that we hit a milestone yesterday where
we actually started the field survey portion of our work. Obviously, it was not the greatest
day to start that work out in the field, but we did start. I think we are taking a break today.
We started in Japantown, we will next move to neighborhood commercial districts
throughout the city, and we expect this work to take about 3-4 years to complete the
entire city, but it is a big milestone. We have talked about this survey for decades so it’s
good to get underway on the field survey portion of it. And then, second, on the Housing
Element, 1) again, thank you for all the work and guidance and direction and all the work
you did last year in getting us to an approval. I did want to let you know that the appeal
period for the Housing Element EIR expired the Monday before Christmas and we didn’t
receive an appeal so we will move next to the Board of Supervisor. The schedule remains
the same although they won’t have the need to take up an appeal. Just to remind you of
the schedule, we are expecting to be at Land Use Committee at the board on the 23rd and
