The mayor intends to introduce the ordinance next Tuesday.  
 
The purpose of Cars to Casas is to encourage housing development on parcels that are 
currently being used for auto-oriented uses, with the goal of easing the City’s housing 
shortage while addressing the impacts that automobiles have on climate change, 
pedestrian safety, and livability.  
 
The ordinance would do two main things. The first would be to remove the CU requirement 
to convert an Automobile Service Station to another use, and the second would be to 
decontrol for density on lots with an auto oriented use. Auto Oriented use is defined as any 
Automotive Use as defined in the Planning Code as well as any lot that has an accessory 
parking lot or garage. Properties with existing housing or a legacy business would not be 
eligible for the program.
