Director’s Announcements 
 
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
Thank you.  Commissioners, the only announcement I was going to make was, no no, was 
what President Melgar said, Kate was honored last night along with five other city 
employees for a Good Government award. It was a very lovely event downstairs in the 
North Light Court. And we are very proud of her for all of the work that she's done.  She has 
become, as I said in my comments last night, she has become our go-to person on all 
things related to housing. And particularly her willing, her ability to kind of cut through the 
bureaucracy and just make sure that these projects move forward. Especially affordable 
housing projects. So, we really appreciate Kate’s work and we congratulate her on the 
award. Thank you.

Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic 
Preservation Commission 
 
 
Aaron Starr: 
Land Use Committee  
• 
190007 General Plan - Downtown Area Plan Amendment - 175 Golden Gate Avenue 
Sponsor: Haney. Staff: Butkus. Item 1  
• 
180645 Planning Code, Zoning Map - Rezoning, Preservation Designation - 175 Golden 
Gate Avenue. Sponsor: Haney. Staff: Butkus.  
 
At this week’s land use hearing, the Committee heard the rezoning and GP 
amendment for 175 Golden Gate Avenue. These ordinances would rezone the subject 
property to C-3-G and make corresponding changes to the Map 1 of the Downtown 
Plan so that the property can take advantage of the TDR program. You heard this item 
on September 27 of last year and voted to recommend approval. At the hearing, only 
the project sponsor’s representative spoke during public comment, and no significant 
questions were asked by the Committee members. The item was then forwarded to 
the Full Board with a positive recommendation as a committee report.
