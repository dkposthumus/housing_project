Director’s Announcements 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Thank you, Jonas. Good afternoon Commissioners. One, I wanted to echo the thanks to 
Commissioner Chan, who really inspired us to move quickly on the fellowship and the 
Young Planner's Fellowship. You have all seen the success of our College Internship 
Program, so we hope and intend that this will be as successful, so thank you, 
Commissioner Chan. And thank you, Commissioner Tanner, for your words about the 
growing anti-Asian rhetoric and violence that we're seeing in San Francisco and around 
the nation. We're having various conversations at the staff level about that and hope to 
have more. But I think it only heightens the importance of our collective work around 
Racial and Social Equity, and that’s taking hold in our centering racial equity in our Housing 
Element, strengthening our Cultural Districts, applying the Equity Budget Tool to kind of 
our decisions around the budget, but I think it underscores, too, the amount of work we 
still have to do, so thank you for those words.
