Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic 
Preservation Commission 
 
 
Aaron Starr, Manager of Legislative Affairs: 
 
This week, the Land Use Committee considered Supervisor Ronen’s ordinance to allow light 
manufacturing and wholesale storage uses in the 24th Street-Mission Street Neighbor 
Commercial District. The Commission heard this item last week and unanimously 
recommended approval. During the Land Use Committee, there was one public commenter 
representing the Calle 24 Latino Cultural district who called and supported the ordinance. 
After some minor technical amendments were made to the ordinance the committee 
forwarded the item to the full board with a positive recommendation.  
 
 
Lastly, the commission continued the hearing called by Supervisor Peskin on strategies to 
maximize affordable housing on public lands for one week to allow more time for discussion.

At the full board this week, the board passed on first read the landmark designation For The 
Royal Baking Company. The CEQA hearing for 350 San Jose Avenue was withdrawn and 
therefore, the determination was upheld. And the appeal for 1776 Green Street, also a CEQA 
appeal, was continued to December 15th.  
 
 
That concludes my report and I am happy to answer any questions.
