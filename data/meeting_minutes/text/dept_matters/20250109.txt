DIRECTOR’S ANNOUNCEMENTS 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Happy New Year to you all. As you know, the mayor has sworn in, Mayor Laurie was sworn in yesterday. New 
staff in room 200 that we will be working with. I think, you know, it’s been widely reported that there will be a 
Chief for Housing and Economic Development who I think will we’ll be working most closely with but also on 
the infrastructure side. So, getting to know staff in the Mayor’s office, also the board. You know there was a lot 
of shifting at the Board of Supervisors, there is a new President, President Mandelman, and we’ll have yet to 
hear what will make up the Land Use Committee where we do most of our work. So, more to come on that as 
we know but just wanted to recognize that and wish you all a happy new year.     
10. REVIEW OF PAST EVENTS AT THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, BOARD OF APPEALS AND HISTORIC PRESERVATION 
COMMISSION 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
I have no report from the Board of Appeals and the Historic Preservation Commission has not yet this new 
year. But on behalf of Aaron Starr who is out ill, he wanted me to report that there is not much of a board 
report but that the board did hold its inaugural meeting on Wednesday and unanimously elected Supervisor 
Mandelman as the new board President.
