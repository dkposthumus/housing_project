Director’s Announcements 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Good afternoon, Commissioners. And my mother always told me I mumbled and talked 
too fast so I will slow down. So, just so you know, the Housing Element, the redraft of the 
Housing Element in response to comments we’ve received from the public in HPC are 
going to be posted on our website today by the close of business. So, that will be there for 
officially 7 days of public comment before we submit it to HCD. But obviously, we are 
looking for comment from the public and you and the board from now ‘til adoption. So, we 
will also have a document posted that will point to what has been changed significantly in 
the document. So, that will be available tomorrow. Thanks.
