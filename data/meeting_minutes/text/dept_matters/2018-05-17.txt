Director’s Announcements 
 
Director John Rahaim: 
I have just one announcement Commissioners. I wanted to call your attention that the 
various schemes for the Resilient By Design competition which is the competition related 
to various sites around the region related to sea level rise is wrapping up right now. In fact, 
there are public presentations going on as we speak at the Jazz Center and those are all 
being streamed live and will be available online and each of the nine teams has a video 
that explains their process as well. If you're interested in that or the public is interested in 
that, the website is available to see these various sites to see just as a reminder, the site in 
San Francisco is the Islais Creek site and there are eight other sites in the region, as well, 
that have been proposed for this competition. So there are a number of events today and 
tomorrow related to the projects as well. It's very exciting and very interesting proposals. 
That concludes my presentation. Thank you.
