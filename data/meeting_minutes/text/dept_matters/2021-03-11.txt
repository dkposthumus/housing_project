Directorâ€™s Announcements 
 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Good afternoon. One item I wanted to mention today, as you know the Department is 
currently working on major updates to the City's General Plan which include the updates 
to the Housing Element, the Transportation Element, Safety and Resilience Element and 
incorporating Environmental Justice Policies into the General Plan. These are ongoing and 
there's public engagement processes related to each of those. Though we do have over the 
course of the next two weeks I wanted to update you and the general public about some 
outreach activities that we have starting March 15th and going through the next two 
weeks. It's a series of virtual events and you can find details on our website at 
SFPlanning.org that are open to anyone who lives, works, and spends time in San 
Francisco. So, we'll have kind of broader topics on what the General Plan does and then get 
into details and have specific sections on those various elements as well as on Youth 
Engagement and our Racial and Social Equity Action Plan, our Recovery Plans as well. So, 
there is a series of events over the next two weeks. I encourage you all to take a look at it, 
too and attend where you would like to. So again, information on our website at 
SFPlanning.org. Thanks.
