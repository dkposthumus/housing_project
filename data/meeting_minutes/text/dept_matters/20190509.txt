Director’s Announcements 
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
Thank you, Jonas. Just wanted to briefly call your attention Commissioners to the memo that 
I put in your packet regarding Central SoMa and the Prop M allocation. Really, just 
summarizes some of the discussion you had at your hearing in April and some further 
information based on the questions that you raised at that hearing. So, I just wanted to make 
sure you caught that and if you have any further questions on that, I'd be happy to answer 
them at a later date. Thank you.   
 
Commissioner Fung: 
Question on that. The excerpt you did on what the code mandates in terms of the criteria, 
the briefing that we received as an example on Harrison did not specifically address those 
criteria.   
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
I'm sorry the briefing you received on?   
 
Commissioner Fung:

Harrison Street.   
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
Harrison Street?   
 
Commissioner Fung: 
For the small project allocation.  
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
Oh, I see. Well we – these – yeah I can't remember the briefings, so I apologize 
Commissioner. We can certainly look at that - - 
 
Commissioner Fung: 
The question raises, you know, on most of your other instruments like CU’s, you know, you 
have the five criteria.  
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
Right. 
 
Commissioner Fung: 
Your General Plan Referrals, you have a way of dealing with that so the question is whether 
it would be good to have a specific response to those criteria from staff as we track through 
because I believe the allocations of many projects will be coming forth.   
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
Right. Okay, that’s a good catch and we can certainly look at that more specifically, thank 
you.   
 
Commissioner Moore:   
Director Rahaim, do you have that memo in front of you by any chance? I may be not 
properly reading it. In the first paragraph, first line, you were saying that Prop M, approved 
by voters in 1986 give the Planning Commission the sole authority to allocate office space. 
And then, in Public Benefits under the point three, you're determining, though, that which 
office development best promotes public welfare would be up to Board of Supervisors, 
Board of Appeals, and Planning Commission. Are those two things inclusive or exclusive of 
each other?   
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
Let’s see, item 3, I'm sorry.  
 
Commissioner Moore:   
It's in the second – under Public Benefits the first paragraph with number 3 in front of it in 
parenthesis. In determining which office development best promotes the public welfare, 
convenience and necessities of the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Planning 
Commission shall consider.   
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
I think that was just simply meant to the actual code language. Its still, the Commission still 
has the authority to approve or not approve.

Commissioner Moore:   
But the sole authority  
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
The sole authority.  With of course the appeal to the Board of Appeals.  But yes. 
 
Commissioner Moore:   
Okay.  That wasn’t clear to me.  Thank you. 
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
Okay, thank you.

Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
On behalf of Mr. Sanchez, the Board of Appeals met last night and held their first hearing 
without Commissioner Fung. Vice president Rick Swig assumed the position of President at 
the Board. And the Board considered one item that may be of interest to the commission. 
The Board adopted resolution encouraging the Board of Supervisors to establish notice 
requirements to all tenants of residential buildings when permits are issued to add ADUs.
