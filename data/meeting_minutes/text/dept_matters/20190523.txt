New Construction. Sponsor: Safai. Staff: V. Flores  
 
This week, the Land Use Committee heard Supervisor Safari’s Ordinance that allows ADUs 
in new construction and brings our ADU program into compliance with state law. 
Commissioners, you heard this item on March 6th and recommended approval with the 
following modifications:  
o A maximum of 1,200 square feet for No Waiver ADUs in existing single-family 
homes;  
o Amendments related to Historic Review proposed by the HPC; and  

San Francisco Planning Commission

o Other clerical amendments.  
 
Supervisor Safai did move to incorporate these amendments into the Ordinance at the 
Land Use hearing and directed the City Attorney’s office to draft those amendments.  
 
At the hearing, public comment was generally in support of ADUs, but some commenters 
had concerns about protecting tenant services, and the overall length of the ADU review 
process. Some also express support for imposing rent control on ADUs in new construction.  
 
Supervisor Peskin moved to duplicate the file to incorporate amendments related to ADUs 
in existing buildings. These amendments address many of the concerns raised during 
public comment. The Ordinance was then continued to June 3rd with the intent to 
approve this Ordinance as amended with the commission’s proposed modifications and to 
send the duplicate file back to the Planning Commission.
