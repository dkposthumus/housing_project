And then finally for the Board of Supervisors, Legislative Affairs Manager Aaron Starr 
provided to me that the Fourplex legislation was continued to the June 6th Land Use 
Committee and the Mission Cultural Center passed landmark nominations, passed its first 
read at the Board of Supervisors. 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
 
If I can add on Fourplex legislation because we did get a question as to why it wouldn't 
come back. Currently the proposal that the Board is considering is to limit those, limited to 
only property owners who have owned their property for five or more years to take 
advantage of the density increase to go from two units to four. And although we didn't 
necessarily discuss that as a policy issue when it came to us, it's limiting and we think, kind 
of dramatically limiting the ability for lots to take advantage of this. So that's why it didn't 
come back to the Planning Commission, just because it limits the number. Yeah, it's more 
restrictive.
