None. 
4. REVIEW OF PAST EVENTS AT THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, BOARD OF APPEALS AND HISTORIC PRESERVATION 
COMMISSION 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
No one is here from the Legislative team and requested that I give you a brief update that no Planning items 
were at Land Use. However, the Zoning-- excuse me, the Stonestown General Plan Planning Code and Zoning 
Map amendments were passed on the second read. I have no report from the Board of Appeals, and the Historic 
Preservation Commission did not meet yesterday.
