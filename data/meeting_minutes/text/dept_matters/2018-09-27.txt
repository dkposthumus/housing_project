Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic 
Preservation Commission 
 
 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
The Board of Appeals met last night and considered one item that may be of interest. The 
Board heard an appeal of the building permit for a rear horizontal addition at 575 
Belvedere Street. The Planning Commission heard this item as a discretionary review 
earlier this year and voted unanimously not to take DR and approve the project as 
proposed. Last night the Board voted unanimously to deny the appeal and approve the 
permit as proposed. The Board noted that the project was designed in a matter that 
respected the adjacent properties and complied with the residential design guidelines.
