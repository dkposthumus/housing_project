Director’s Announcements 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Good afternoon, Commissioners. Just a couple of items. One, I wanted to give you an 
update; I mentioned previously that the Mayor had established an economic recovery task 
force. That work is starting this week and the task force has been put together. I think 
there are close to 100 people if not more on it. I am going to serve on it, former 
Commissioner Fong as well as Assessor Chu are amongst the co-chairs. So, we'll come back 
to through either a director’s report or an informational item to update you on the task 
force's work. Our staff will be involved, as well. I also wanted to thank and note, many of 
our staff are working currently as disaster service workers. As city employees, we all have 
an obligation to serve as disaster service workers and we have about 20 or more 
employees serving now who have served in various capacities from front-line staff to 
helping with some of the planning efforts. So, I wanted to just recognize and thank them. 
And that's my report.
