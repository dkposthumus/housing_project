Director’s Announcements 
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
In the realm of interesting code enforcement cases, I thought I heard on NPR in this 
morning report that the famous Sagrada Familia church in Barcelona, which has been 
under construction for 130 years, has never had a building permit. And the Mayor of 
Barcelona today announced an agreement with the church, that they will grant them a 
building permit in return for 36 million euros. Which will be used for street improvements 
around the church to accommodate all the traffic because it is now Barcelona’s, excuse me, 
I think it is Spain’s number one tourist attraction. So code enforcement does occasionally 
work.  That is the end of my comments for today. Thank you.
