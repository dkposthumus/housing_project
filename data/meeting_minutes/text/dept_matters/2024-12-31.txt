Directorâ€™s Announcements 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Good afternoon, Commissioners. I just wanted to give you a quick budget update for the 
Department. We are due to submit our nine-month report to the controller's office 
tomorrow, and we're estimating a $6 million loss in fee revenue or, you know, we're not 
going to meet budget by $6 million for our own fee revenue. We're also awaiting direction 
from the Mayor's Office for general fund impacts. Our fee revenue is about $41 million per 
year, so we believe we're about $6 million under budget for the year. Mostly due to this 
health crisis and lack of applications now and estimated in the remainder of the year. So, 
we'll come back and talk to you more about that. We anticipate that we can bridge that 
gap by keeping positions vacant and reducing some of our non-personnel expenditures. 
But I just wanted to alert you of that as we submit our estimates to the controller's office. 
Thank you.   
 
Commissioner Moore:   
I'm sorry, Director Hillis. I was asking as to whether or not the additional cost for 
conducting these televised meetings in the form that we do incur extra costs, and do they 
have to be borne within your budget?
