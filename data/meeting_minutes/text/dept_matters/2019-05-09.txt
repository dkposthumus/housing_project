Directorâ€™s Announcements 
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
Thank you, Jonas. Just wanted to briefly call your attention Commissioners to the memo that 
I put in your packet regarding Central SoMa and the Prop M allocation. Really, just 
summarizes some of the discussion you had at your hearing in April and some further 
information based on the questions that you raised at that hearing. So, I just wanted to make 
sure you caught that and if you have any further questions on that, I'd be happy to answer 
them at a later date. Thank you.   
 
Commissioner Fung: 
Question on that. The excerpt you did on what the code mandates in terms of the criteria, 
the briefing that we received as an example on Harrison did not specifically address those 
criteria.   
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
I'm sorry the briefing you received on?   
 
Commissioner Fung:
