Directorâ€™s Announcements 
 
 
AnMarie Rodgers: 
Thank you very much. Hi, I'm AnMarie Rodgers, on behalf of John Rahaim who is out of the 
office today. As many of you know, last Friday there was a tragic accident on Howard Street 
that resulted in the death of a cyclist, Tess Rothstein. And on behalf of the Department, we 
wanted to confirm our deep commitment to increasing cyclist and pedestrian safety in all 
of our long-range planning work. Secondly, I wanted to update the Commission and the 
public on some of the permanent improvements that we're working on but you should 
know that this is in light of there were immediate actions that MTA took to remove parking 
along this stretch. As for as the long-term process, these are flowing out of both our south 
of downtown design and activation plan and would implement some of the components 
of the Central SoMa plan. The Planning Department is working with the MTA and Public 
Works to create a two-way bikeway on the stretch, reduce vehicular traffic lanes and 
redesign intersections along Howard between the waterfront and 4th Street. This work is 
called SODA, and we'll be presenting these concepts to the public in mid-May with a goal 
to go out to bid in 2021, and construction would immediately follow. Thank you.
