13. DIRECTORâ€™S ANNOUNCEMENTS 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Yeah. No announcements. Welcome Commissioner Campbell and Commissioner McGarry. Oh, just briefly, this 
morning, I was at the reopening of TransAmerica Pyramid, which was a great event. It's $1 billion investment in 
downtown San Francisco. I think the good thing the building we know and love remains the same. And the 
biggest changes to the ground floor in the park, in the lobby and just making it more open and transparent and 
welcoming. I think Norman Foster, who was the architect, said that was the one kind of flaw he saw in the 
building was just making it more open and active. So there's going to be art and cultural events in the park 
adjacent to it, and it's just much more open and inviting. So check it out. Thank you.
