Land Use Committee 
 
240169 Planning Code - Parcel Delivery Service. Sponsors: Chan. Staff: V. Flores.  
 
This week the Land Use committee considered the duplicated version of the Parcel Delivery Service ordinance 
sponsored by Supervisor Chan. The purpose of this duplicated ordinance is to add a retroactive date to the 
original parcel delivery service ordinance. Originally that date was March 9; however, since the interim 
controls end on March 30th, Supervisor Peskin amended the retroactive date to be March 30. After it was 
amended, the ordinance was forwarded to the full board with a positive recommendation.
