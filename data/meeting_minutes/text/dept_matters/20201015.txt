Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic 
Preservation Commission 
 
 
 
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary: 
I have been advised that there is no report from the Board of Supervisors. The Historic 
Preservation Commission did not meet yesterday. So, I have not heard regarding the Board 
of Appeals and I don’t see the Zoning Administrator either so I will assume that there is no 
report for the Board of Appeals.
