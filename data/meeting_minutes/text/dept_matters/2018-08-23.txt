Director’s Announcements 
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
Commissioners, I also was going to, and welcome back, by the way, to all of you. I was 
going to mention that untimely passing of Mary Gallagher. As you know, she was at one 
time, for a short period, the Zoning Administrator for the City and the Department. So 
Mary has a long history of working with us and with the community. So, we were fairly 
surprised and saddened by her passing as well. The second announcement I had was, is 
good news. You may recall that going back to 2005 or 6 there has been an ongoing series 
of litigation and lawsuits against the City on the housing element. It goes back to the 2004 
Housing Element. You recall there was a court decision at that time that required the City 
to conduct a full blown EIR on the Housing Element. That was unprecedented for the time 
we were the first City in the State to have to do a full blown EIR on an element of the 
General Plan. And the City, then, because of the timing, we did an EIR on both the 2004 
and 2009 Elements. That case has just been resolved this week in the Court of Appeals and 
the court found completely in the City's favor. So, we are very, very pleased about that. It 
has been a long time coming. I just wanted to do a shout out, if I may, for the key attorneys 
in the City Attorney's office who were involved on this. Audrey Pearson has been on this 
case for a decade, and spent a huge part of her career so far on this, so we thank her 
greatly for that and Jim Emmery at the City Attorney’s office, as well as Kate Stacey here, 
who has been looking over all of our shoulders on this for a very long time. So, I just want 
to thank the City Attorney's office for all their work on this after all these years. Thank you.   
 
Commissioner Moore:    
Director Rahaim, was this ruling based on the EIR? It was based on the EIR.
