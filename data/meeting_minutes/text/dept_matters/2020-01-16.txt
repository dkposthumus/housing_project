Director’s Announcements 
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
I will start with congratulating President Koppel and Vice President Moore. Thank you. We 
look forward to working with you in the few weeks that I have left. And the staff will I’m sure 
look forward to that as well. Let me just also thank Commissioner Melgar for all of her great 
work on this Commission. What I really appreciate about your work, commissioner, is the 
balance that you brought to your work and the thinking that you brought. That was super 
helpful to me and very helpful to the staff. And I really appreciate your taking on the task, 
not a small task of finding my replacement which I know was not an easy task. Thank you 
for all of your work that you did on that and we look forward to working with you in the 
future and great good fortune. Thank you.   
 
President Koppel: 
And as soon as I was done congratulating and wishing you luck, I also wanted to thank you 
for the last year of your leadership and especially leading the charge with the search for the 
new director. I really appreciate all of the direction you gave us.
