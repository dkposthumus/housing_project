Director’s Announcements 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Commissioners, good afternoon. I just wanted to follow up on a request that was made last 
week by Commissioner Moore and Commissioner Imperial, to get information on bills 
moving through the state legislature. So we sent a memo this morning and you should have 
received it from AnMarie Rogers, who also posted with the agenda on tomorrow for next 
week's agenda. That basically outlines recent number of bills moving through the process, 
that bills at the state level will need to be moved out of their house of origin by June 19th, so 
it’s a relatively short timeline. There also is a press release issued by Tony Atkins who is the 
Senate President outlining five bills that have taken priority over the dozens of others that 
were moving forward. So, we can eventually provide more information on those five bills as 
they work their way through the process. I just wanted to give you some initial information 
on the request that you made last week. That is all I have.

Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic 
Preservation Commission 
 
 
Aaron Starr: 
At this week's Land Use Committee hearing, there were no Planning Department items and 
at the Full Board this week, Supervisor Mandelman's conditional use authorization 
requirement for Demonstrably Unaffordable Housing passed the second read, and your new 
colleague on the Planning Commission, Deland Chan, was approved by the Full Board. That 
concludes my report. Thank you.
