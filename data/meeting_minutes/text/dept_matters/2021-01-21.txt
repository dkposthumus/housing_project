Directorâ€™s Announcements 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Good afternoon Commissioners. First of all, congratulations. Smooth election restored by 
faith and democracy. I just wanted to give you -- I emailed out a letter earlier today from 
Mayor Breed and Supervisors Ronen, Mar and Mandelman that was sent to ABAG and MTC 
regarding Plan Bay Area 2050 which as you know is the long range regional plan and it 
focuses on Housing, Environment, Transportation, and the Economy. The plan allocates 
growth of households and jobs in the region to counties and cities and it is part of the 
methodology that we use to allocate -- to make the RHNA allocation.  It's ultimately 
approved by MTC and ABAG which will happen later this year, but the draft of the plan, that 
was released in December (an original, an earlier draft had been released in the summer) 
this is the final draft, gave us some concerns and concerns to the Mayor and the Supervisors. 
And ultimately shifting a growth into San Francisco is about a 53% increase in allocation 
from new households to San Francisco. So, from about 139,000 to 213,000 households over 
the plan period, which is to 2050 and we're not the only city being affected. There are 
definitely others that are getting increases but we are probably the most significant. I think 
one of the bigger issues we had is where the growth is being allocated from and where it's 
being allocated to in San Francisco. So that ABAG and MTC divide the city into quadrants. 
So, again most of the increases coming in from the Southeast section of the city which as 
you know have seen a lot of growth and has gentrification and displacement, pressures, 
housing many of our communities of color and vulnerable population. So, that gave us
