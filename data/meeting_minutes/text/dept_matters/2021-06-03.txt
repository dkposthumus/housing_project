Directorâ€™s Announcements 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
Thank you, Commissioners. And I was going to mention the same thing about the internship 
program. Thank you, Commissioner Chan for bringing it up and thank you for all you have 
done to make it possible. And Tina Tam too, I want to thank for all her work because it was 
a big lift from the time we started to discussing it, to getting it to this point, and having 
actual interns. So, thanks again.  Our college interns also start next week. So, there are 25 
college interns as well as 15 high school interns. Some of them will be on kind of a similar 
hybrid model as well. And we will definitely reach out to you all when there are 
opportunities to engage with them as well as for their final presentations. Thank you all 
again. 
 
 
 
Commissioner Moore: 
I wanted to suggest to the director to let us know early where these students are coming 
from. And again, I definitely will offer my availability to help mentor, tutor or explain. I have 
been on for a while. Besides being in the profession there are things to share. Please make 
yourself avail to my being ready, including letting us all know early on which particular 
schools you have chosen. I am always curious on that. Thank you. 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
 
Okay. Thank you.
