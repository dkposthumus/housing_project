Directorâ€™s Announcements 
 
 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
And just a little additional info on the Council. And there is information on our website as 
well for the public including who is on the Advisory Council. It is made up of 11 community 
leaders dedicated to working to advance Racial and Social Justice. Some familiar with our 
processes in the Planning Commission. I think you will recognize some of the names from 
your work on the Commission but some who aren't. And we thought that was a good idea 
to bring both leaders, who are familiar with our work as well as those who may not be. So 
in addition to, as I said deepening our engagement and advising us on how to deepen our 
engagement, we are looking for specific advise and input from the Council on our work 
around Housing Element and other General Plan updates, our budgeting and 
programmatic priorities, implementation of our Phase 1 of our Racial and Social Equity 
Plan as well as development of Phase 2. Please let us know if you have questions. It was an 
inter-Departmental effort in forming the council. So, I want to thank HRC and ORE as well 
as OEWD and Supervisor's offices who we consulted for their advice and thank Miriam 
Chion and Tameeka Bennet for their work. But particularly thank the Council for their 
willingness to participate.  
 
I also want to give you some news on the Permit Center at 49 South Van Ness expansion of 
in Person services there. Today was a soft launch of expansion of some services. Next 
Monday, May 10th will be an official launch of expanding over-the-counter permitting at 
the Permit Center. This is the first step to getting the Permit Center back up and running. 
So customers will still need to make appointments and will continue with the other 
permitting agencies, DBI, etc., to handle the same volume of over the counter permits. But
