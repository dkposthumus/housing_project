Directorâ€™s Announcements 
 
 
John Rahaim, Planning Director: 
Good afternoon, commissioners. No new announcements today. I think it would be 
interesting to talk to the staff and the new director about that issue and bringing some 
other experts and there is a San Francisco Land Trust who have not been very visible in 
recent years but I think it would be interesting to bring them in and talk about that issue. 
Just a side note, I remember thinking of three or four years ago, at the height of the 
economic boom that if I had been in a position during the recession to make that 
recommendation, that the city could have purchased more land during the recession when 
land prices are a fraction of what they are now, it would have been a great thing to do to 
land bank some land during that time. Unfortunately prices now are so much higher but at 
any rate always the future to think about it.

Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic 
Preservation Commission 
 
 
Aaron Starr: 
 
The Board did meet this week, but they only had one item at the Board and that was the 
Twelve Named Neighborhood Commercial Districts which they pass on second read. If all 
goes according to schedule, it should be effective by March 3rd.
