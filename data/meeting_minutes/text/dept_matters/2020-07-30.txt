Directorâ€™s Announcements 
 
Rich Hillis, Planning Director: 
I wanted to make some comments on SB35 and how it relates to RHNA goals because the 
issue I think came up with Commissioner Diamond a week ago or so. And just some 
clarification but we can get you more information on this too and even in our next hearing 
about state legislations as we talk about it. But as you know SB35 streamline housing 
improvements when cities have not permitted sufficient housing to meet their eight-year 
RHNA goals and those goals are divided to affordable, lower incomes and above moderate 
income. And currently the city is meeting its above moderate goals but not its affordable 
and lower income goals. And so, projects that have 50% or more affordable can move 
through the process under SB35 in a streamline ministerial approval.  
 
So, as we look to the next cycle, and our expectation is that the RHNA goals are going to be 
two to three times larger than the current cycle. The timing is a little interesting on how this 
works. SB35 needs to be re-authorized in 2026 so it is also unclear whether those 
requirements will still be applied, but it's a look back over four years. Once the RHNA goals 
are set, the period of time is divided between the first four years and the second four years. 
And we look back as to whether we have met our goals and when SB35 takes effect. It's a bit 
complicated. We can give you a memo that will explain this more but the provisions of SB35 
and how they relate to our RHNA goals won't necessarily apply until the new RHNA goals 
are adopted in there some time to look at how we're meeting our resources. So, we can have 
more information on that in the coming weeks.
