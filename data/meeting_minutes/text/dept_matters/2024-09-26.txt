This week the land use committee considered the Establishment the 555 9th Street Special Sign District, 
sponsored by Supervisor Dorsey 
The proposed Ordinance would amend the Planning Code and Zoning Map to create a special sign district at 
555 9th. The Ordinance models the sign regulations after the C-3 zoning district with two exceptions: 1) 
allowing additional wall signs on the second story facing the internal parking lot and 2) video signs up to a 
certain size and distance from the pedestrian entrances.  
The Commission heard this item on July 18th and adopted a recommendation for approval. During the 
hearing, Commissioners expressed concerns with impacts of illuminated signs on adjacent residences.

amended and recommended as amended to the full Board.
