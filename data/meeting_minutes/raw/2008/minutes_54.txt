6.Commission Comments/Questions(Tape IA)
Commissioner Moore
-Reflecting back on last week on the presentation from the Mayor's Office and Economic Development, I would like to point out an article in the New York Times of March 26.
-Millions of jobs of different colors; green jobs are little more than just a trendy term that just hand out prospects that are still to be defined -- blue color jobs upgrading to green to address the environmental challenges of our country.
-I have sent it to the Mayor's Office of Economic Development, Mr. Michael Cohen.It is a very interesting article.
-Another article, Amit Ghosh was quoted  Planning start thinking how to feed us.There are 600 green plots in the City that could be potentially used for food production.
Commissioner Olague
-I read an article last week in the Sunday's Chronicle about San Francisco Open Spaces.There were 15 or 16 listed there.
-I would like to know if there is such a listing in the Planning Department or maybe in Park and Recreation.
-It says that all these are governed rather subjectively.Is there any kind of enforcement?
Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator
-We can get you a list of Public Open Spaces created since 1985.There are other plazas that have been created.That article is listing only 16 and I think there are more.
-They were not in exchange and they are maintained in good shape.
Commissioner Sugaya
-The issue is not whether they are well kept but that many people just do not know they are there.
-We have one next door that was part of the Conditional Use.They have a terrace but it is not visible.You even have to go inside the building to see the plaque, if they have one, saying that there is a public accessible open space.
Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator
-I believe that we have a standardized plaque and I believe that it should be on the outside.
Commissioner Moore
-For significant building security, many of these spaces you cannot access.
-How are we looking ahead in dealing with building approvals which in reality can not provide these spaces anymore?I think we need to come to terms at some point.
Commissioner Antonini
-Is there a differentiation between ground level and above grade open space?Is there a requirement that some of them be on ground level?
Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator
-The preferences are 7 or 9 categories of open space in the Downtown Open Space Guidelines and we try mostly on grade and open.Hotels would have it inside.
Commissioner Moore
-I would like to have a special meeting on the subject matter to sit together and talk it through for standards and expectations of how to move forward with open space.
7.Director's Announcements
John Rahaim, Director
-Regarding my trip to New York last week:there were five cities - the others were Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and Boston - represented in the meeting of primarily housing development officials.
-They invited the Planning Directors because the topics were the inclusionary zonings.Other cities approach it differently, where San Francisco has an interesting mix.
-Secondly, there is a memorandum in your packets about your request on Van Ness corridor and we came up with the same numbers as the article in the Businesses Times.It is about 2,000 units with a potential for about 1,000 more.

BACKSTREETS REPORT–Informational presentationby members of the Back Streets Business Advisory Board to review the findings and recommendations contained in their recent report  Made in San Francisco.
SPEAKER(S)
Supervisor Sophie Maxwell
-This particular presentation is near and dear on my heart because some years ago I sponsored a legislation that established the Backstreets Business Advisory Board.
-At that time there was much discussion about the need for new housing developments in San Francisco as well as the growth of high technology related businesses in the City.
-Receiving less attention form policy makers with the thousands of small and light industrial businesses in San Francisco, many located in the South East sector of the City.
-These businesses continue to play an important role in the local economy by providing 6,000 well paying jobs, relatively stable jobs for residents of San Francisco.
-We need to allow space and place for businesses to growth and to come and incubate.
-The Backstreets Advisory Board compromises small business owners, industrial operators and community builders.I thank all of them for their commitment to San Francisco.
Peter Cohen
-This report is an attempt to tell our story in understanding a segment of the City's economy through the perspective of real people who run businesses.
-We did research with other cities to see what others are doing proactively to deal with their industrial sectors.
Mark Clement
-We have a broad range of recommendations that fall into six general categories:(a) improves City's data and tracking of industrial land, (b) proactive methodologist, (c) land use creating some king of certainty, (d) infrastructure, (e) workforce/employer development program, and(f) development of industrial business alliance.
Bob Legallet
-We come today with our report to create awareness to the Planning Commission that there is a segment of the economy that does not have a voice with the Chamber of Commerce or at City Hall.
Todd Ruffus, Office of Economic and Workforce Development
-I serve as the primary point of contact for information and assistance for industrial businesses in San Francisco.
-That assistance typically manifests itself in four ways:(a) navigating City's government for industrial businesses, (b) incentives, (c) connecting businesses to talent/employees that they are looking for, and (c) retaining workers.
Tom Raduvolich
-These businesses are high technology businesses located here and serving for artists.
-I urge you to think about a logistic center strategy as part of supporting the Eastern Neighborhoods as well as supporting our retail businesses.

SPEAKER(S)
Cynthia Servetnick
-In accordance with the mitigation monitoring and reporting program, no environmental impacting activities or no choice limiting activities take place prior to NEPA clearance [National Environment Policy Act] if HUD money is to be used.
-No demolition permit should be issued until this project either clarifies whether it will or will not use HUD money.And if they will, that NEPA clearance is completed.

SPEAKER(S)
Joe O'Donaghoe
-In 1986 there was no balance between neighborhood needs and growth and the Commission set forth a policy for RH-1 and RH-2 to choose whether to build out or up.Plans are being approve now allowing both things.
-I urge the Commission to readdress those policy matters.
John Bardis
-Requested the Commission to ask the Zoning Administrator to put in writing his statements about the Academy of Arts University.
-Last week I requested the five largest industries in the City and I hope you take the time to respond.
Judith Berkowitz
-In the Backstreets report, there was much discussion about the need of infrastructure.As it was presented, perhaps you can entertain a series of meetings addressing the caring capacity of the land to figure out the kind of growth San Francisco can bear.
Mark Solomon
-The Eastern Neighborhoods economic section for the Mission Plan does not speak at all to business to consumer businesses.
-In terms of the City Economic Plan, which is a very dense document, it is a nice exercise to use as a guide post but not to be a bible or cast in stone situation because the economy varies with time.
Sarah Karlinsky
-SPUR has embarked on a project to take a look at privately owned already developed public spaces in terms of if they have met what we wanted when regulations were put in place as well as how they are managed and the public nature of the spaces.

Preliminary Recommendation:Approval

SPEAKER(S) on the consideration for continuance

SPEAKER(S)
(-)Hiroshi Fukuda

(+)Tom Radulovich
-Supported Supervisor Mirkarimi's amendments because they strengthen the plan and brings back several things from the 2002 draft plan.

(-)Judith Berkowitz
-No body was informed or invited to be part of the discussion on these amendments.

The existing stair and elevator penthouses would remain and would not be expanded.The subject property is in an RH-3 (Residential, House, Three-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and approve plans with modifications
(Continued from Regular Meeting of March 6, 2008)
SPEAKER(S)
Paul Weaver, 1stDiscretionary Review Requestor
-Opposed the size, scope and intended use of the rooftop expansion as it will also set precedence in our historic neighborhood.
-Objected to the way the construction has progressed because individual permits have been successfully pulled to enable completion of the infrastructure for the proposed rooftop.
-I feel that the project is in direct conflict with the historical Garden Daly's and it is unprecedented within the current scope of the neighborhood.
Terri Anderlini, 2ndDiscretionary Review Requestor
-This is going to change the character of the neighborhood and set a bad precedence.
-It is contrary to the attempt of what a roof is supposed to be about.
-The public view would be obstructed with an unappealing view of the Bay and tourists may not enjoy their walk as much as they have in the past.
Nancy Shanahan, 3rdDiscretionary Review Requestor
-This is going to set a bad precedence.It is not about preserving private use but preserving the scenic character and unique built environment of the area.
-This is about adding an entire floor of outdoor living space including a kitchen dining room, viewing area, planters, fire pits, compressors and solar panels.
(-)Garret Shean
-I think that the problem is that there are no clear standards for whether or not this project should be accepted.We do not have a target to compare it with.
(-)Stan Teng
-The rooftop is going to be so dense with so many elements spread out all over the place.
(-)Joan Wood
-I urge you to take discretionary review and reduce the extent of the proposed additions because it will set a bad precedent and affect the character of the neighborhood.
(-)Joe Luttrell
-The roof deck with sound equipment where a lot of noise is being generated is going to affect significantly the residents on this block.
(-)Judy Irving
-Concerned that glass railings/windscreens are not visible for birds and it is going to impact humans and other species.
(-)Mary Lipian
-This project is essentially a total floor of additional living space.It is not a rooftop but a fifth floor violating the spirit of the height limit.
(-)Nan Roth
-This appears to be an excessive exploitation of the roof as well as the product of a questionable sequential permit process.
-Concerned with the fire pit that potentially could start a fire with the high winds in the area.
(-)Don Rich
-This project looks like a new living quarter room and kitchen adding footage to the height limit.
(-)Patricia Shean
-Concerned with the potential open flame with so many things in a very small neighborhood.It is dangerous.
Jeremy Paul, Project Sponsor Representative
-The Residential Design Guidelines are clear on this.The use of private buildings and decks are not protected.
-The requestors have eating, barbecue, sitting and a pool.But somehow this sponsor should not have what the requestors have.
-Is the proposal an exceptional or extraordinary nature?It is not.There are a lot of big roof decks in the area.
(+)Kirk Scott
-Supported the project because the sponsor followed everything that staff recommended and private views are not protected in San Francisco.
(+)Alan Steremberg, Owner
-We have lived in apartment building and we enjoy that.Our intent is to provide rental units at a fair price.
-We want to highlight green features.We just won an award of honor from the Board of Supervisors for our help with the climate challenge in San Francisco.
(+)Paul Scott
-Supported the deck to use the space to the extent possible for children's activities and the deck is hardly seen in the neighborhood.
(+)Jane Gilespe
-Delighted that this is going to be available and that the sponsor is leasing that place.
(+)Courtney Minick
-The project is properly designed and will be a welcoming improvement.
(+)Todd Henry
-Read a letter on behalf of James Hong supporting the project and concerned about various delays impeding completion of construction.
(+)Charlotte Bannenstiel
-Supported the construction of the deck because it is organized and tasteful.
(+)Sylvia Johnson
-Supported the project.
Motionto take DR and approve with modifications:no amplification of noise after 10p.m.; no glass wind screens or glass railings; no fire pit except staff's reduction as shown earlier; everything on the cross hatching green to be eliminated; we acknowledge that skylights are 1 foot height except for the originals.
