SAN JOAQUIN REGIONAL WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT–Informational Presentation andPublic Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact ReportThe San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) proposes the San Joaquin Regional Water Quality Improvement Project to improve water disinfection capabilities at the SFPUC's Tesla Portal site and the Thomas Shaft site, both within unincorporated San Joaquin County. The Tesla Portal site is located about 7.5 miles south of the City of Tracy, at the western terminus of West Vernalis Road. The Thomas Shaft site is located about 7 miles southwest of the City of Tracy, near the end of Thomas Shaft Road approximately 1.5 miles south from its intersection with Corral Hollow Road. At the Tesla Portal site, the Tesla Treatment Facility is proposed, which entails replacement of the existing Tesla Portal Hypochlorite Station with a new Chemical Process Building and Office/Control Building, and the construction of an ultraviolet (UV) facility, which would disinfect water using a series of UV light arrays. At the Thomas Shaft site, the Lawrence Livermore Water Quality Improvements would upgrade the existing water treatment facility with a UV system. Both facilities are proposed to meet disinfection requirements of the Surface Water Treatment Rule and the Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule.An additional public hearing will be held in the project vicinity on September16, 2008. The SFPUC will provide information to the Planning Commission about the proposed project and the Draft Environmental Impact Report.

F.PUBLIC COMMENT
At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public comment, the commission is limited to:
(1)  responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or
(2)  requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or
