C.COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS(Tape IA)
9.Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Antonini
-Thanked Amit Ghosh for sending the San Francisco Neighborhood market.It is a great, well done report.It is very interesting and has much of what was brought up in some newspaper article.
-That article brought up some interesting points that there was a shortage of banks and credit unions in various neighborhoods.
-An interested thing they came up with is some numbers having showing a significant increase in medium household income in 2002.
-My question for staff is that there is a difference between the San Francisco Mayor's Office of Housing data with a medium income of $65,000 and what this data has shown $92,000.Who is right?
Commissioner S. Lee
-I would like to make an announcement that I will be resigning from the Commission at the end of today's meeting.
-She acknowledged colleagues' work.
-I have been on this Commission for the last six years and being on this Commission has reinforced my belief that neighborhoods are really the life force of the City.
-The protection, preservation and enhancement of the quality of life in our neighborhoods are really critical to the future of the City.
Commissioner Olague
-On channel 9 there was a series called  The Natural Causes' speaking on how to create healthier neighborhoods and better quality of life living in cities.
-The Department of Public Health has done a few studies I think starting with the Eastern Neighborhoods Community Health Impact Assessment.
-Now on the web there is something called the  Healthy Development Measurement Tools' and you can find it atwww.hdmt.org
-It does explore some of the findings that the Public Health Department made in terms of access in certain neighborhoods that can create a good quality of life.
-Yesterday, there was the opening of the ECO City Conference 2008.I believe it is an international conference and the Mayor's Office of Economic Development made arrangements to have us attend.
-A lot of the courses focused on how to create more sustainable green cities throughout the world.
-The Mayor [Newsom] gave an opening speech highlighting a lot of the goals that his administration has for creating a green city.
-I encourage staff to schedule a special hearing on the green policy as the City is creating it – sometime after the Eastern Neighborhoods, sometime in July.
-A couple of months ago, Commissioner W. Lee requested some analysis from the City on State measures 98 and 99.
-It seems to have a lot of implications in terms of how planning is done in cities around affordable housing.
-If other commissioners are interested maybe we can have an information item next week.
Commissioner W. Lee
-I would like to have it before the June election.
-Also on the request of a special hearing on the green policy, it would be good to ask someone from the Hotel Carlton to give us a brief on the cost effectiveness and return on investments on solar panels.
Commissioner Antonini
-I think it is always good to be informed to the extent that these measures would have an affect on land use policies realizing that it is an election and we can not take a position on it.
Commissioner Moore
-Regarding solar panels, I would like to ask staff as well as the City Attorney's Office that as far as I know that energy generated by solar panels that exceeds what the need is of its own facility it is not returnable to the grade.
-I think it is contrary to the idea of using solar panels as a general contribution to energy production.
-Contrary to us, in Europe you would see total small communities relying on the combination of wind and solar and being able to sell excess back to the grade.
-I think that is a true idea of sustainability. I would like that we address it as a policy issue because solar by itself creating more than you use means you loose.
-I would like to take that as part of our discussion on green policy.
10.Director's Announcements
John Rahaim
-I will be attending the American Planning Association Conference which is happening in Las Vegas this year.It is also happens to be the 100thanniversary of the conference.
-The Commission asked a couple of weeks ago for some information on the Bike Plan EIR and I just want to give some dates on that:
-It was initiated last year and the notice of preparation occurred in the summer of last year.The initial study was published on March 15 and the comment period for that phase was closed on April 14.
-That allows us to move forward with the transportation analysis, the biggest component.
-We expect that the Draft Environmental Impact Report will be published in the fall of this year and the current schedule calls for certification in spring 2009.

Preliminary Recommendation: Hold public hearing to allow public comment and continue item to allow for additional neighborhood outreach and completion of environmental review.
(Continued from Regular Meeting of March 20, 2007)
SPEAKER(S)
Michael Burk, Academy of Arts Representative
-I'm requesting a continuance because an environmental review is not complete yet and so we can continue communication with neighbors to address concerns.
-Smoking and skate boards would not be allowed.Also, the number of rooms would be converted from doubles to singles dropping the over all student population.
-There have been concerns about noise but police statistics speak for themselves and there has been an incredible dramatic improvement.
(-)Delou Jordan
-I'm concerned about criminal activities, nuisance in the neighborhood, and the lack of security at the university.
(-)Patricia Vaughey
-I have not heard a word from the Academy of Arts with the actual intent to remedy this whole situation.They are just saying they are trying but not really working on it.
(-)Eileen Dick
-This conditional use is inappropriate because the use does not belong and it would be difficult to make the necessary findings.
(-)Greg Paul
-Approving this application would be reinforcing the attitude of buying first and asking the Commission to legalize it later.By denying it, you would be sending a strong message.
(-)Sue Hestor
-This is a real estate empire as well as an academic institution and they have financial abilities that no other in the City has to buy buildings.
-It is not compatible with the neighborhood and it is not the best way to provide student housing.
(-)John Bardis
-Other big institutions provide housing on site along with a true educational experience.They need to have their Master Plan in place.
