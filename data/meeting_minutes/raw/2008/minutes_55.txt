President Olague announced the formation of a subcommittee of 2 to 3 Commissioners in order to continue the process of public hearings for the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan.
SPEAKER(S)
Marilyn Amini
-Setting a subcommittee to hear such an important matter as the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan, it sets an extremely dangerous and counter productive precedence.
-If there is no quorum, it would be important to continue the Eastern Neighborhoods instead.
11.Commission Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements.Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Antonini
-A few weeks ago we had a representative from ABAG.Frequently we hear about ABAG's numbers in regards to housing production.Generally what ABAG does is produce suggested housing production figures by cities and counties at certain income levels below the 50 percentile, up to 80 and above the 120 percentile.
-I called ABAG just to see if anything has changes.Most of what has been used in the past is figures from the year 2000 or a little bit before.
-I talked to Mr. Phasinger who is the ABAG Research Director who says that actually there are new numbers out that were calculated in March of 2008 and released on May 5, 2008 that say that San Francisco has some fairly significant changes.
-There are two reasons for these changes.One, we have looked a the income levels in San Francisco much as the report did and noticed some changes in income.Significantly, many areas where there were higher incomes than before it acknowledged that San Francisco had done a very good job relative to many parts of the Bay Area in providing housing at the 50 percentile or lower.
-What they did was to sort of revise the goals for San Francisco.I have a copy of this and I will submit it to staff here.
-They have probably about 35% of their suggested goals below the 80 percentile, about 65% above the 80 percentile with the highest amount by numerical total being above the 120 percentile.
-This is what he pointed out in contrast to San Ramon, Pleasanton, and Dublin -- areas that are growing a lot but have provided no lower and affordable housing.
-They have figures, for example, where they have provided about 68 percent of their housing below the 80 percentile with a very significant amount below the 50 percentile because they probably have none or very little at all and a much lower allotment on higher levels which they are producing a lot of.
-I thought that was interesting and the key for the whole thing is that when we talk about affordable housing it is really important to specify what part of the affordable housing market we are talking about.
-ABAG acknowledges different levels are getting different housing production.They have taken that into consideration.
-I think it is really important as proposals come forward and when they talk about affordable housing to question what we are specifically talking about.Are there any restrictions on levels or limited to percentages of income or things like that?
Commissioner Moore
-I would like to share something that for the first time I observed last night in a small neighborhood restaurant.
-We all know that in response to sky rocketing cost for health care and the lack of coverage for most Americans, that the City enacted a landmark ruling to add health benefits as a mandate for all businesses.
-That gives small businesses as well as large businesses a choice to either fold that 4% increase into the cost of what they sell or offer to people, or to declare it to patrons as an add on tax.
-I was at a small restaurant that took the position to disclose and add a special 4% pretax add-on to cover those costs.
-They indeed proclaimed participating in a landmark decision and I found that refreshing to have it disclosed instead of making it more expensive and not say why.
-They handed out a small sheet explaining the reasons and I commend small businesses to do that.I think it is easier to just disclose it and since we all support small businesses, all power to them.
Commissioner Sugaya
-I would like to ask Mr. Rahaim of Mr. Badiner if you know the current status of the Historic Preservation Element.I have kind of lost track.
Director Rahaim
-The specifics I do not know, but I do know that it is on hold because of a change in staff.Rachel left the Department.And being the primary staff person on it, we have to this point been unable to fill that position because of the budget issues.
-There is a draft out there but it has not gotten any further at this point.
Commissioner Miguel
-I just wanted to mention that last night there was a meeting at Cesar Chavez Elementary School.David Alumbaugh, Director Rahaim, Planning Department staff, as well as DPW and DPT were there.
-I was surprised because I have been in many community workshops and meetings that are put on by various departments in the City.There were about 60 people in attendance.
-It was well run and attended with a lot of enthusiasm from the neighborhood.This was for planning streetscapes in a large area of the Mission District.
-The second half was very specific to Cesar Chavez Street itself.
-This was the first one of about four [meetings] that will be done in the neighborhood.This was specific as to street and streetscapes that affect planning, housing, commercial and everything else, which dictated somewhat the manner in which it was handled.
-The comments that came out of the general public were extremely sophisticated.We have a lot of households in the City that know something about planning and they know what they want.They have some original ideas on how to go about it.
-I thought that the Planning Department did a good job.
Commissioner Olague
-A question for the City Attorney's Office:we are approaching election season in November and I think it is important for the commissioners to have some kind of understanding of what roles they can or can not play on local measures/issues.
-I think we need a private training or a venue like this one to have a better understanding of how we can or can not be involved in local issues.
Kate Stacey, City Attorney's Office
-Our office prepares written advice on participation in election and political matters.I will make sure that the Commission gets a copy and if there are any further questions, let me know.
12.Director's Announcements
Director Rahaim
I want to thank Commissioner Miguel for attending last night's meeting on The Public Realm and Better Streetscapes and also thank staff for doing a great job.
-Next Thursday there is a noon public release of the Draft Better Street Plan that the Mayor is scheduled to attend on June 5th.You have a special hearing that day and I thought that it would be important that I attend the release and not the 11:30a.m. special meeting.
-We are scheduled to brief you on the Better Streets Plan that same day.You will be hearing about it just a few hours after the public presentation.
-We will also brief you on the budget next week.It is going to the Board of Supervisors.It has been changing fast and furiously over the last couple of weeks and we will brief you next week.
-We have been working on what I am calling the Process Improvement Strategy for the department in response to the Matrix Consultant Report as well as response to other reports such as the SPUR.We are having a series of meetings with some of our stakeholders.
-We are also planning to bring to the Commission next month some of our first phase of recommendations for that report, probably in the second half of June.
-Another item that I want to mention is the National AIA Convention.It is in San Francisco next June.They are expecting around 27,000 attendees.
-I have engaged with some local organizers to propose a couple of sessions that are based on San Francisco's design, architect and planning issues.Those submissions are due July 1.
-Finally, Commissioners have asked for a run down of what the former Director Macris is doing.He is a senior policy advisor in the Mayor's Office.His projects are the Transbay work, chairing for the Mayor the interdepartmental team focusing on things like the Better Street Plan, chairing an interdepartmental group looking at the Civic Center, and he is also working as a personal advisor to me on an occasional basis and to staff on projects that have a long standing history with the department.
Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator
-I just wanted to give a brief update to you on the general advertising sign program.We are about 20% through the program.We had 71 illegal billboards removed and I think that is an outrageously high number in terms of making progress.We have also 23 that were brought back down to their legal height.
-I have to commend Jonathan Purvis, Kimberly Durandet, and Dan Sider who is the team leader.Also, I'd like to thank Elaine Forbes, who has been very instrumental as a leader on that program for awhile.
13.Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals

14.(D. ALUMBAUGH: (415) 558-6601)
Transit Center District Plan-Staff will give anInformational Presentationon its initial concepts for the Transit Center District Plan.
Preliminary Recommendation: Informational only, no action requested.
SPEAKER(S)
Patricia Vaughey
-I am disappointed with what the Planning Department is allowing for the downtown.We have to be carefully of the topography and how it is being done.
Dick Millet
-I do not like this because I tend to think that we have to protect the view of the water to see the boats and the bridge.We can build everywhere but not on the shoreline.
Sue Hestor
-One of the things you should do and require is consider the perspective at car level on the Bay Bridge because that is what the urban design plan talks about -- having a relationship to the water as you're driving into San Francisco.We are loosing it by a wall proposal at this time.
-The Planning Department needs a post construction analysis.
ACTION:No Action is required of the Commission.Informational presentation
15.(B. Bendix: (415) 575-9089)
1250 Missouri Street-Informational presentationon the status of the project.
SPEAKER(S)
Jim Reuben, Project Sponsor Representative
-I did the public hearing in 2001 but I started working on it in 1998.
-This is one of those projects that we purchased at a time when certain things could be done on the property.
-This particular project got a lot of scrutiny and the plan was very detailed.It was clear that this was not to be a residential/live-work project.
-I have recently become engaged in this project again and I am asking for some time to be able to work with the project sponsor and work with staff to bring this building into compliance.
Dick Millet
-This project is in an industrial zone where the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan is rezoning and the plans are coming out for this particular area to remain industrial.We have to correct this.
Keith
-Concerned that the industrial zone remain in that area because personal opinion is that industry and residences do not co-exist.
Reese
-There are some points that are correct and the building requires some modifications to make it comply.For most part I believe they went to the building department and tried to get their permit.I hope that the end result is for this project to move on.
Sue Hestor
-The plans were made available just two days ago and the full bathrooms are still shown.Another thing that is very strange is that they still show the coffee-bars with a lot of removable walls.
-The other thing is that they added fire places in a place that are more than Planning ever sought.
Tony Kelly
-I think they are trying to build what they intended to build in 1998, which is a live-work building.They could not get it done in 2001 so now they are doing it incrementally through stages and revisions. They should build what was approved by this Commission in 2001.
Patricia Vaughey
-You need to go back to the process where real full sized plans were presented to the public.It is really hard to see what is being proposed on the small ones to prevent this kind of situation from happening again.
ACTION:No Action is required of the Commission.Informational presentation
D.GENERALPUBLIC COMMENT â 15 MINUTES
At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting.Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
SPEAKER(S)
Tony Kelly
-I just wanted to check with Planning Department staff about the public record request on the Innovative Industry Special Use.I turned it in two weeks ago and it was supposed to be for immediate disclosure.
Marilyn Amini
-I want to address the formation of the Commission Sub-committees on matters as significant as area plans.The public has the right to be heard by the Commission as a whole as intended by the Charter.
[No name stated]
-There was a matter about two years ago, similar to the 1250 Missouri Street, at Golden Gate Avenue and Lion Streets involving tenants.The Board of Appeals took jurisdiction.You need to ask staff to contact DBI.
Michael McNigh, Re:804 Lion Street
-2 years ago our landlord had a permit to remove our back deck and stairs; we fought that permit.There was a notice of violation only requiring repair of the existing stairs of the deck.
-The current permit, with the Fire Department, should never have been issued because we were not informed about it and the work they want to do does not have to be done.
-Urged to bring this permit to this Commission as a discretionary review.
John,Re: 1998 Golden Gate Avenue
-This flat is in a rent controlled building, and in November 2002 a private owner investment purchased the building.
-The first action was to evict long term tenants.Then in early 2003, they filed notice of violations against their own property claming my flat and my neighbor's flat were illegal units.
-I urge the Planning Commission to take a close look at our property and request to take it back to Planning.
Jason,Re: 808 Lion Street
-The fire escape and back deck has always been there.The owner plans to remove the back deck and fire escape claiming that it is defective but we know it has a legal permit.
-Please bring this back to this Commission and review all of those permits under discretionary review.
Richard,Re: 804 Lion Street
-This building is under rent control and probably half of the tenants that now live in the building are paying below market rate on the property.
-The owner wants to remove the fire escape, back deck, and garden, which is a community area.These are very important in case of an emergency.
Danny,Re: 1960 Golden Gate Avenue
-All of the back decks are tide together into my back deck and there is some person who apparently lives in my place and applied for a permit to remove it.I do not know who that person is.I in no way want my back deck removed.It is really dishonest to do that.
Miriam, Re:800 Lion Street #3
-We disapprove the removal of fire escapes and back deck because it is the only way out in case of a fire.I urge this Commission to bring back those permits under the discretionary review process.
John Bardis,Re: Academy of Arts University
-We have a crisis in our City with affordable housing and the Academy of Arts University is taking over 700 units from our housing stock without disclosing an Institutional Master Plan.This is an opportunity for the Commission to fulfill its duty to see that the laws of our City be upheld.
Patricia Vaughey
-I hope that Better Streets does not start working on Lombard and Chestnut unless they talk to the Chestnut Street Lombard Master Plan Committee.
-Subcommittees for the Presidio Trust is being set up through Michela Alioto-Pier's Office concerning the Environmental Impact Statement.We would appreciate someone from this department to be on that committee with us.
-Design guidelines are not being followed in residential areas.
Ron,Re: 804 Lion Street
-Thanked the Commission for helping us two years ago and we seek help again regarding the situation with the back decks and the back yard for decreasing our personal safety.
E.PUBLIC COMMENT ON AGENDA ITEMS WHERE THE PUBLIC HEARING HAS BEEN CLOSED
At this time, members of the public who wish to address the Commission on agenda items that have already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the public hearing has been closed, must do so at this time.Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
SPEAKER(S)
(-)Patricia Vaughey,Re:1860 Lombard Street
-I went back to my Board and they agreed that we do not want formula retail stores in the area and there is no necessity for another sandwich shop.If you choose to support this application, please give no liquor license and impose a closing time of 7p.m.
(+)Peter,Re: 536 40thAvenue
-I looked at this project and spoke with the sponsor and they have made modifications.It is a good project and I support it.
(-)Patrick Mulligan,Re:1860 Lombard Street
-I oppose another Subway restaurant because they already have many outlets in the City and over 29,000 outlets in the country, according to Google.
(+)Luis Galvez, OwnerRe: 1860 Lombard Street
-I have been in business in that area since 1984 and many sandwich shops have gourmet prices that many people can not afford.
-That area has been deteriorated because many establishments are selling liquor.
(+)Michael Naulty
-All three sites on your agenda for Subway we support because it would be helpful for low income families.Subway is a fast food outlet and would not sell alcohol.
Susan Brian
-Subway offers more than sandwiches and the corporate culture promotes healthy food.

-The monument that will be at the corner of Sacramento and Buchanan Streets would be lit with direction to the emergency room directly below the emergency room sign.There is no need to have two brightly lit signs at the same corner.
-The purpose for the signs is for directions to the emergency room and not for the medical clinic or the hospital where people go during the day and have an address.
Carion Cliff, Chief Administrative Office for California Pacific Medical Center
-For many years we have received complaints from patients and visitors unable to find the emergency room.The proposed signs will help with that.
-These signs will better direct traffic to the proper parking area.Our intent is to reduce the wandering behavior of vehicles on the streets surrounding the campus.
Shawna Hackly
-The sign for the emergency room is currently set back from the corner and is not visible coming from Buchanan Street.

-If you are to adopt the staff's recommendation and disapprove this legislation, I would suggest that you seek out some of the letters in the resolution that basically says that at no time should there ever be off site units more than a mile from the principal project.
-Alternatively; if you choose to recommend approval of this legislation, there are two points I would ask you to ask the Board to think about: (a) a limit of 25% off site units can be more than a mile from the principal project, and (b) place a prohibition on any off site units that are more than a mile away from being a quarter mile of a public housing project.

Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project.
SPEAKER(S)
Phillip Ng, Requestor Representative
-The proposed project is not in line with our neighborhood and it would block air ventilation and natural light.
-The only ventilation that we get is from a narrow gap and it is crucial to keep it that way and not make it narrower.
(-)Christie Ng
-Read a letter from a neighbor opposing the expansion because it would reduce natural light, air, and it would impact privacy.
(-)Stephen Ng
-The project would create a lot of hardship by blocking air and natural light.
Scott Brady, Architect for the Project
-The addition is approximately 40 feet away from other properties and I do not think there is a real affect on air and ventilation.It extends only eight and a half feet.
-The addition if pretty much minimally intrusive.
