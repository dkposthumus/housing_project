B.COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS(Tape IA)
8.Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Antonini
-I just want to clarify my remarks from last week about 3500 19thStreet.In no way did I imply that the Commission should not be actively engaged in the process of meeting with project sponsors, requestors, architects and others to try to gain knowledge on projects as early as possible.
-It is extremely helpful and my remarks were more in terms of proper process regarding staff position on notifications to the Commission as to what is going on with particular projects.
Commissioner S. Lee
-Happy Chinese New Year.
-Two comments:one is related to formula retail legislation.I would like to ask whether staff is considering making amendments to the legislation to address some of the concerns that have surfaced.
-The  Red Mango' is one where the legislation is silent when a retail establishment is defined formula retail.Perhaps a status report on it at some future date would be helpful.
-The other is a question about the status of the acquisition of the Flower Mart by the Academy of Arts University.I wonder if staff has been in touch with either of the parties involved.
-I recall that the transaction was supposed to be complete by the end of February.We have heard a number of things represented by the attorneys of the Academy of Arts University, about negotiations with the businesses in preservation and protection of those businesses.
Commissioner W. Lee
-Regarding the formula retail, I was approached by the President of the Teacher's Union – ICI.Apparently, they would be covered under the formula retail.
-It would be good to have a scope of what this includes or does not include.Maybe we could ask the Board of Supervisors to make some changes that certain types of stores be exempted.
-We do not have a  Red Mango' in San Francisco and they wanted to come but we did not let them come in.
Commissioner Moore
-Today we have an MCD [Medical Cannabis Dispensary] seeking approval under item 20.
-As a general concern, the support for MCD [Medical Cannabis Dispensary] is kind of waning.It is being impaired by the DA's attempts to interfere in the operation of these institutions.
-Apparently, there is a hearing at the Board of Supervisors next Monday trying to reestablish support and I hope that the support is going to be clear as we are continuing to consider approving MCDs.We indeed get the feedback that the policy is supported by all is clear.
-I was wondering if the Planning Department that operates for the City and County of San Francisco has some secret plans somewhere about 20 under-water parcels right off Hunters Point, 100 feet off the shoreline that is going onto the Auction Block in San Mateo on March 10.
-I was very curious because the Planning Department would have to provide information for use and access that currently does not exist.
-I got this in the mail with a picture including reference to the Planning Department being able to provide perspectives and file information about these 20 parcels starting with a minimum bid of $500.
Commissioner Sugaya
-I was talking to a neighborhood person and in his perception, continuing issues of tenants-in-common ownership affects the rental stock of housing in the City.
-He was wondering whether the City was attempting to keep track of conversions from rentals to TIC.
-This morning's newspaper has an article about it.It says that there are approximately 1,000 conversions per year.
-There is another organization that apparently is pro-TIC called Plan C.They had a figure of 637 in 2007.
-There must be some figures out there somewhere but I do not know if the City is actually keeping track of that through this department or maybe the Mayor's Office of Housing.Maybe we can get some information on that.
-I think the Commission received an e-mail from the Commission's Secretary with respect to 55 Laguna Street.There was a file appealed by the Save Laguna Street Campus but there is no hearing date yet for the Board of Supervisors.
-I have the appeal letter if anybody is interested in reading it.
9.Director's Announcements
John Rahaim, Director
-Today you will hear an item relating to the Consultant's report on the Operations of the Department.I know you have been interested in this item for some time.We will talk about that.
-I have been working recently with the Commission Action List and we are going to try in the next couple of weeks to set priorities on these requests.
-Relating to that, there are requests for briefings from other departments and offices.
-Two that I am specifically working on are the briefing by the Mayor's Office of Economic Workforce Development on the City's Economical Strategy, and also with the Mayor's Office of Housing with the  Hope San Francisco' program.
Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator
Commissioner S. Lee
-I understand the sensitivity but we have an industry that is at risk and we do not want to see those businesses close because they are not coming back.
Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator
-I will contact Jennifer Mats of the Mayor's Office of Economic Workforce Development for a status report and will let you know.
There was consensus among commission members to schedule an informational item on the Academy of Arts University on next week's calendar.

SPEAKER(S)
John Gallagard, Police Officer
-This place is becoming a nuisance and our officers have identified three drug dealers purchasing there and selling it on the street.
-This would be the third club in three blocks and the 1,000 foot rule should apply.
Brian Soriano, Project Sponsor Representative
-It has been in operation before the proposition legalizing the cannabis clubs was enacted by the voters of the State.
-The complaints that are going to be offered to you today are intended to identify current problems in the neighborhood and connect them to the dispensary.
-This is a diverse socio-economic area and many patients are within the neighborhood.
-First meeting with the neighborhood was held on August 30th, 2007 with participation of 15 people identifying concerns:safety, clustering, loitering, and offending odors.
-The response or action taken in response to those concerns was to put in private security patrol and security cameras.

(-)Simon Butler
-This particular dispensary does not seem to be well run and we are very concerned about security and safety.

(-)James Whereat

(-)Silvia Johnson
-This location should be moved because there were no explanations of it.
(+)Stuart Packman
(+)Chad Calvert
(+)Marcelino Andrade
-I would feel less safe without the club there.They are good providers.
(+)Michelle Aldrich
-We put the regulations to make it easy for the neighborhood and have a choice.
-It seems that there are miscommunications and that can be remedied.
(+)Michael Aldrich
-Spoke in support of the dispensary because it is doing an outstanding job on Height Street.
(+)Hanley Chan, Special Police

(+)Nikolai Bonds

(+)Aaron Pulaski
-Jason [owner] cares about the entire community and the crime going on in the neighborhood is not Jason's fault.
(+)Chuck Kalimar
- Under the scrutiny imposed, it would not be smart to behave in any other way than helping decrease the crime in the City.
(+)Kathleen Bernard

(+)Lynne
-Jason [owner] has been very respectful and approachable and he needs to be given a chance.
