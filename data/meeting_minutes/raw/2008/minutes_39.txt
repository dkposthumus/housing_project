Western SoMa Citizens Planning Task ForceStrategic Analysis Memos- The second of three informational presentations of the Western SoMa Strategic Analysis Memos.This presentation covers the analysis of existing conditions forTransportationandOpen Spacefor the Western SoMa Special Use District.These Strategic Analysis Memos provide background and analysis of conditions considered by the Task Force during the formulation of policy recommendations for a community plan that will be presented to the Planning Commission in July 2008.
SPEAKER(S)
Jim Meko, Chair – Western SoMa Citizen Task Force
-I started coming to this Commission's hearings about 15 years ago.Back then the projects were approved with the idea that the Folsom Corridor was a transit rich one.
-The reality here is that the Folsom Corridor is not transit rich.The only line there is being discontinued because of low ridership and that is because the bus comes every 30 minutes.
-We have been engaged in some serious communication with TJP and the MTA staff.It is very clear that if South of Market does not get better transit service aligned with the community plan that we are going to propose, we are going to oppose every project that comes along.
-Building housing without a good transit is going to encourage people to buy and/or use cars.And you are not going to switch that thinking based on promises.
-Western SoMa has only one official park.You would think that we would be transit rich and full of parks and open spaces.
-This is the chance to stop and get our priorities straight.I hope that you will understand why we make the recommendations that will come out in the Draft Community Plan.
Marc Solomon
-We are looking at ways that this neighborhood gets the same respect that other neighborhoods get, which is to work and live here and get home safety.
-It is critical that our planning process be informed of this – to tie the relationship between transportation and housing – to have good transit first then to work on housing.
Anthony
-Building housing without a good transit system is going to bring more cars.We have to think about that when interfacing transit on the Western SoMa Plan.
Sue Hestor
-In your mind, start translating all of these into the rest of the Eastern Neighborhoods because there is very little difference with the Mission District.
Peter Albert, Deputy Director of Planning - MTA
-I just want to remind you that MTA is looking at West SoMa and the Eastern Neighborhoods holistically and making sure that we do not ignore issues that come up in the West SoMa process as it works in the Eastern Neighborhoods.

SPEAKER(S)
Marissa Kravens, Association of Bay Area Government [ABAG]
-Tonight I am speaking on behalf of the Regional Focus Program - a collective effort of Bay Area cities, ABAB, The Metropolitan and Transportation Commission, Bay Area Air Quality Management District, and the Bay Conservation and Development Commission.
-Eastern Neighborhoods is what we called a regional priority area.We are committed to supporting and facilitating the planning and development because we believe that the local and regional partnership will benefit all 9 Bay Area counties.
-The adoption of the plan would make the area eligible for capital infrastructure funds and financing streams that helps implement the developments that the plan describes.
Michael, Mayor's Office of Economic Work Force Development
-We are not presenting today but we will be here next week to provide a second summary of the Economic Strategy with the specific focus on how it relates to the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan.
Jon Lau, Office of Supervisor Sophie Maxwell
-On behalf of the Supervisor:Congratulations for getting to this point.I respectfully submit to you that the planning and economic rational for PDR retention really has been truly made in this process, and I think we all in agreement that it is time to act.
-I am available to come every week in the interest of maintaining open communication lines between the Commission and the Land Use Committee.
Eric Quezada, Mission Anti-displacement Coalition
-It is very important that the zoning changes reflect the needs of the community and we are encouraged by the approaching balance that the planners have put forward today.
-We want to make sure that the PDR definition is not one that would provide loop holes that would stop PDR jobs.We do not want to go down that road again.
Fernando Martick
-Made references to the findings and recommendations of Backstreets Business Advisory Committee.Page 20, priority police No. 5 of Section 101 of the Code, that a diverse economic base be maintained by protecting our industrial and service sector from displacement.
Tony
-We are generally supportive of the plan but we need this plan to be balanced and not to advocate for more office space.
-For 16thStreet, build the bus lines that can deliver the people there and then we can talk about being a transit corridor.
Peggy da Silva
-Reducing the PDR is a mistake because there is a great need for space in the waterfront.
Judy West
-I'm concerned with the emphasis on parcel-by-parcel rezoning.I do not think we would have a livable neighborhood.
Calvin Welch
-Praised staff's recommendations for placing affordable housing in some sort of employment context.Often we've talked about affordable housing by itself.
-Many reports, and the most recent economic strategy report of the City and County of San Francisco, have demonstrated that the strength of our economy is its diversity.
-If we ought to develop sustainable affordable housing, PDR occupations, the preservation of industrial uses and light industrial uses, offer a real important opportunity for employment.
-It is an important point to keep in mind that who works in San Francisco should live in San Francisco.
Jeffrey Leibovitz
-I think that the presentation staff did tonight was outstanding and I think this process will move forward in a very positive manner.
Tim Colen
-Encouraged close cooperation with the Board of Supervisors so that the Land Use Committee and this Commission work closely on a parallel track to avoid sudden surprises.
Jazzie Collins
-We need SoMa to be affordable to families – retain affordable rents, viable PDR businesses, and community services to balance the entire neighborhood.
Angelina Cabande
-PDR is really important for people to be able to find employment.They should not be removed from the City.
Debra Walker
-You might want to look at some areas along Potrero Avenue as more neighborhood commercial to create walkable streets in that area.
Jaime Guerrero
-Concerned about the PDR 1-G zoning proposed for the northeast Mission because the current definition allows only day time uses.PDR retail with housing above it will bring more vitality to the area.
Peter Cohen
-Two big questions for me:How do you mediate and balance land use competition between sectors? How do you maintain a diversity of jobs and opt for new opportunities in the City?
David Lera
-If you have a reference to a color code into a zone, there should be a quick reference guide for the public to look at and refer to.
-Urged the Commission to eliminate any reference of SLI within the East SoMa rezoning.
Ingrid Aquino
-Significant community benefits should be provided for the high density bonuses, and it should be decided by existing community members.
Steven Aiello
-Supported the UMU and allowance of student housing in the PDR design district.
-Recommended to keep the SLI in the East SoMa only as a short term strategy.
Ronald Konopaski
-It seems like the City has always been tampering with the problem we have with affordable housing.
-It seems to me that we are [undermining] the taskforce and creating more needs for affordable housing where we already have a problem by providing it.There is a conflict overall.
Angela Sinicropi
-Strongly disagreed with the PDR only zone because it is going to isolate people that have their businesses/housing along 16thStreet.
Beth Weintraub
-I oppose the proposal for the PDR only zone because the parcels designated as PDR are not large enough to create it.We need more mixed use zones.
Tony Reynolds
-Overtime, the change that occurs drives people out creating an enlargement for criminal activities.
Antje Kann
-I'm strongly opposed to PDR zoning proposed for our neighborhood, the northeast Mission, because it does not meet our needs.
Ariel Braunstein
-We need to have a reasonable policy that has safety, direct access to our parks, better transportation, open spaces, respect of PDR and affordable housing.
Steve Vettel
-I propose that the two block area on Third Street be more flexible on PDR - ground floor retail for huge parcels.
Keith Golstein
-I previously requested that you include a neighborhood commercial district on 17thStreet - from Arkansas to Mississippi Streets.
-I urge the Commission to reconsider the designation of biotechnical use on that section of 17thStreet.
Fred Snyder
-The businesses that are viable to be next to housing, you are pushing them out and you are going back to the 1950's and wanting to bring in businesses that are failing.
Kepa Askenasy
-We would like to see student housing, night time entertainment, performing art theaters, art studios, and neighborhood commercial in the area of 17thStreet.
[No name stated]
-Our area is currently zoned M-1 and it would become PDR under the proposal.I'm really worried that the proposal is too restricted and people are going to leave.
Brad Koch
-Someone has to explain what is going to happen with the non-conforming use tenants.
[No name stated]
-Industry should be taking place in the Bayview Hunter's Point because the streets are wide.
Richard Hyde
-We need more flexibility in office space for the top floors of buildings to keep the building alive as the City changes.
Alexis McNulty
-We want to keep our existing M-2 zoning at the waterfront – 24thand Tennessee Streets.PDR zoning means that our neighborhood would be stocked with vacant buildings.
[No name stated]
-23rdStreet from 3rdto Louisiana Streets – We feel that the neighborhood would be better served to stay as M-2 or if it has to change, it should be the urban mixed use zoning.
Robert Meyers
-While staff proposes raising height limits on the waterfront, it is also restricting the uses.I urge that you keep the M-2 zoning or rezone this area to UMU with the innovative industry overlay.
Gillian Gillet
-Supports the 65 foot height on Cesar Chavez and building housing for all income levels.Would like to see protected pedestrian and transit oriented street frontages on Valencia Street extended to South of Cesar Chavez.
Bill Lightner
-Asked for the same flexibility the others speakers have asked for.This is the number one, creative, first class City in the world and we need to keep it that way.
Sue Hestor
-There is going to be much confusion with all the non-conforming use – live/work sites.How are you going to deal with all these housing units that are not really housing?
Ivonne
-Questioned if staff is going to give a summary at the Land Use Committee on Monday because many people may not be able to present their comments then.
