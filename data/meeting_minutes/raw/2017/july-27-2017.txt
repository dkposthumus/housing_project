ACADEMY OF ART UNIVERSITY- Academy of Art University (AAU) is a private postsecondary academic institution that occupies buildings throughout the City (predominantly in the northeast quadrant). AAU plans on expanding its facilities and programs to accommodate a projected on-site student enrollment of approximately 17,282 students and 3,511 faculty and staff by 2020, resulting in a total increase of approximately 6,100 students and 1,220 faculty and staff.  The Proposed Project consists of four general components: study area growth, project site growth, legalization of prior unauthorized changes, and shuttle service expansion. Study area growth consists of approximately 110,000 net square feet (sf) of additional residential uses (to house approximately 400 students, equivalent to about 220 rooms) and 669,670 sf of additional institutional space in 12 geographic areas (study areas) where AAU could occupy buildings to accommodate future growth. The study areas generally include the following areas: Study Area 1 (SA-1), Lombard Street/Divisadero Street; SA-2, Lombard Street/Van Ness Avenue; SA-3, Mid Van Ness Avenue; SA-4, Sutter Street/Mason Street; SA-5, Mid-Market Street; SA-6, Fourth Street/Howard Street; SA-7, Rincon Hill East; SA-8, Third Street/Bryant Street; SA-9, Second Street/Brannan Street; SA-10, Fifth Street/Brannan Street; SA-11, Sixth Street/Folsom Street; and SA-12, Ninth Street/Folsom Street. Project site growth consists of six additional sites that have been occupied, identified, or otherwise changed by AAU since publication of the September 2010 Notice of Preparation (NOP) for this EIR. The six project sites would include a total of 411,070 sf of institutional, bus storage, and community facility uses. The project sites include the following addresses: 2801 Leavenworth Street (The Cannery) (Assessor’s Block/Lot: 0010/001); 700 Montgomery Street (Assessor’s Block/Lot:0196/028); 625 Polk Street (Assessor’s Block/Lot:0742/002); 150 Hayes Street (Assessor’s Block/Lot:0811/022); 121 Wisconsin Street (Assessor’s Block/Lot:3953/004); and 2225 Jerrold Avenue (Assessor’s Block/Lot:5286A/020). The Proposed Project also includes extension of AAU’s shuttle service to serve growth in the study areas and at the project sites. The Proposed Project also includes legalization of changes in use and/or appearance undertaken without benefit of permits prior to issuance of the NOP at 28 of AAU’s 34 existing sites. The Proposed Project includes the occupation and use of existing buildings, as well as construction activities that would be limited to interior tenant improvements, exterior modifications such as signage, window replacements, and security system installation, and in limited circumstances, seismic upgrades.Adoption ofCEQA Findingsfor the Department Proposed Project, which reflects revisions in the Proposed Project to include only residential conversions where the conversion to student housing serves a higher intensity use than what would otherwise be located on the subject site; support conversion of industrial to institutional uses only where the conversion to institutional remains industrial in nature or maintains an industrial component and is therefore best situated on the subject site rather than elsewhere in the City; support conversions of commercial to institutional uses only where the conversion to institutional use maintains a publicly-accessible, active use, and therefore is best situated on the subject site rather than elsewhere in the City; and support conversions of office uses where the institutional use is office in nature, such as the institution’s administrative headquarters, and is appropriate for the subject site. Based on these policy determinations, the Department Proposed Project includes review of all Program-Level Growth and Project-Level Growth analyzed in the EIR.  However, the Department Proposed Project would result in the full legalization of 29 of AAU’s 40 existing and project sites, with 3 pending recommendations.

Commissioner Richards:
I have a couple of things I want to mention. I don't want to get too detailed here, but there was in Sundays New York Times, there was an article entitled When Housing is a Global Asset. It talks about cities like Miami, New York, Melbourne, London, San Francisco, where Russian oligarchs, Brazilian bank accounts, Chinese businessmen -- and the money that flows from them, aren’t just buying penthouses, but they are actually buying real estate to the detriment of the existing residents in those cities. It says evidence is suggesting that now in Vancouver, New York, parts of California; there is enough of this money that actually create ripple effects that disturb local residents. The National Association of Realtors, this year said that in 2015, $153 billion of foreign money came into real estate in the US.Without a doubt foreigners are pushing up the prices in California and Florida, the chief economist of the National Association of Realtors said. It also went on to say that setting aside the risk of money laundering, tax evasion and a big influx of foreign capital, it poses two threats to local housing markets in all of these cities. First, housing prices are rising faster than wages, until a good job no longer actually can pay for access to nearby housing. Suddenly nurses, teachers find themselves living in communities far away or that they can no longer afford. As the housing and labor markets become detached, a city can start to look like Vancouver, which has some of the highest housing prices yet, some of the lowest wages of all Canadian cities. The second issue is that it aggravates the first. If is not for foreign buyers looking for assets in our residences, a lot of the housing it may have sit empty. Neighborhoods begin to lose their neighbors and local restaurants and shops lose their customer base. It becomes an eerie scene. They cited some examples in London, across the entire city; the cost of having foreign money coming in, actually they say outweighs the benefits of having it come in.With all these out of town purchases of dwelling units sitting vacant, rents and home prices in the city rise, wages tick up thanks to new construction, jobs that keep generating more housing, commute times for workers grow longer, and city neighborhoods become less diverse as the wealthy move in. Very good article entitled When Housing is a Global Asset, by Emily Badger, in the page B-3 of the New York Times’ Sunday.And to that end, there is talk now about we've talked about this. I think we should’ve probably pushed for a little bit more. We are talking about taxing vacant homes and commercial spaces. I understand Supervisor Peskin is doing that. We brought this up in dribs and drabs, over the last couple of years. I think, there is real connection between understanding how much is vacant, and how much is exacerbating the housing shortage that we have and that there are good ways to be able to tell who is a foreigner and who is not, and one of the ideas that came up is being able to tax everybody when they file their income tax, they get their deductions back from the tax because actually they live here, so, a good thing.One other unrelated thing, I was going through a neighbor’s old ephemera landmark application for her house and I came across this brochure by the AIA and it talks about the Advisory Design Review. I have no idea whether this happens anymore, but it assists in resolving disputes over neighbors over initial design and residential projects. I’d like to know if the AIA is still in this business. Something that we should point to people, to maybe they can resolve some of the issues they have, become they come to us.Thank you.
Commissioner Johnson:
That was real this time. Thank you very much foryour comments Commissioner Richards and sort of highlighting and giving some background on the vacancy tax issue and I just want to say hopefully, if this becomes a thing, hopefully, it may come to the Planning Commission, I don’t know, probably not, but it depends on how it would be implemented.I just want also to highlight to the members of the public who might be following it, a foreign investment tax, a vacancy tax are related, but not the same thing, so you have places like Vancouver, where the real challenge was sort of foreign investment flooding into the market because capital leaving various countries and Vancouver was agood place to place it, but you also have your Seattle and your San Francisco and various other cities, where it really is about the economic engine of those cities drawing capital and sort of housing as an investment class, then becoming more important. So, we should make sure we separate those two arguments, because they may really be sort of a vacancy tax idea, is unrelated not to whether the investment comes within the United States or outside of it but, yes, highly interested in how that progresses.
Commissioner Moore:
Through the chair, if I may ask to substitute the word foreign with absentee please.
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary:
If there's nothing further, Commissioners, to the chair, I do have a couple of future feature agenda items that I’d like to bring up and discuss with you. First off, I need to apologize, because I didn't recognize that we had on our hearing scheduled slated September 21stas a cancelledhearing in order to recognize Rosh Hashanah, which falls on that date. We did very early on in the year, Commissioners, in January, back in our first hearing continue San Bruno Avenue, the medical cannabis dispensary, that we heard was quite controversial, to the September 21sthearing date. As a result, I just looked at it as any other hearing date, not recognizing that your hearing schedule cancelled it. There are a few other items on there and 5 Leland Avenue, which has many of the same opponents, and a nearby cannabis dispensary, although it was continued to September 14thstaff was recommending that we move it to the date with San Bruno Avenue and hear them both together on the same hearing date, so, it is schedule for September 21st.So,I bring this upto you, so that today we can get a sense, before break, whether or not you will keep September 21st as a hearingdate or should we rather move these item off ofSeptember 21st.If you choose to keepSeptember 21stas a hearing date,I'd recommendreinstating it today, by a vote and motion, and alternatively there are no items currently on October 19thof 2017, that you can choose to then trade off as acancelled hearing date, and it is – it does provides a little more separation from your three weeks break, that is forthcoming, and there is also a fire drill not that that willaffect you too much, but a fire drill is scheduled forOctober 19thin City Hall. Thank you.
Commissioner Moore:
I will ask for Mr. Starr perhaps to give us some guidance whether or not the Board of Supervisors spoke about a moratorium which we supported last week.Will that fall under that same type of purview?
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary:
Well, I suppose only in the sense that might inform your decision to keep or cancel.
Commissioner Johnson:
I think there are also other items on that calendar, right?
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary:
There are several items.
Commissioner Johnson:
So, it’s like a full agenda, we have to decide on that.
Aaron Starr,Manager of Legislative Affairs:Through the chair, so, Supervisor Cohen did introduce an interim moratorium won't be able to act on that until September 5th. If they do pass it, then it is effective in ten days after that or when the Mayor signs it.So, I think that will be on September 16thor 15th.
Director Rahaim:
Aaron, if I may, do you know the details enough to know how it would affect projects that are now in the pipeline?
Aaron Starr,Manager of Legislative Affairs:
It will create just an immediate moratorium on the approval of the Planning Commission – the Planning Department from approving MCD applications. It doesn’t – it is not retroactive.
Commissioner Richards:
But it can cover pipeline projects? Honestly, if that's really where we're going, I watched the hearing last week and scheduling might be futile.
Director Rahaim:
We won’t know until September.
Commissioner Johnson:
So, I guess it seems to me, that we have two decisions to make. It sounds like because of those two MCDs were added September 21st, other items were added like it was a regular hearing, we have to decide if we'll have a hearing on the 21st and then if we do have a hearing on the 21st, we can talk about continuing those items off of that calendar.I’d say, I think we have a discussion about our calendar and we discuss the variousholidays, thatwe want to make sure, we didn’t have meetings around, and I remember Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah coming up specifically, I’d say, I know is close to our three weeks break,I'd say, if we have it as a day off to keep, as a day off, because I remembered that we had a back and forth about which holidays to not schedule hearings around and there was substance to discussing September 21st. I didn't want to dismiss that unless there is a good reason not to.So, I’d say put the September 21stitems on October 19th.
Commissioner Richards:
I agree absolutely like someone wanting to have a meeting on Christmas, is the same to me.
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary:
So, we keep September 21stas a cancelled hearing and move the other items that are currently scheduled off of it?
Commissioner Johnson:
I think that answer our questions, because we'll then know if there is a moratorium or not certainly.
Commissioner Richards:
So, do we need a motion on that?
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary:
No, you don’t need a motion on that. I’ll just take that and note it, but I will not move all the items to October 19th. I think we can juggle them sooner than to October 19th.
D.DEPARTMENT MATTERS
9.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Thanks good afternoon Commissioners, first, I just wanted to give you an update of activities with the Academy of Art, you do have the informational master – the Institutional Master Plan on later, as an informational item, but I just want to talk about the other items that we have been working on, because while we're not ready today to bring you the DA, we are working pretty diligently with the Academy on what they are required to do under the settlement agreement. So, first consistent with the requirements of term sheet, which you reviewed a few months ago, we have received their first Annual Report on housing occupancy, if you remembered, that was a requirement of the settlement agreement, that they give us their report. It reflects their percentage of their on campus population, and so we are reviewing that right now, we received that very recently. Secondly, the Academy has selected an affordable housing development partner, CCDC, for development on both Pine Street properties. This again, if you recall was part of the settlement agreement that the existing building being turned over to the affordable housing developer, the lot next door be developed as an affordable housing site, so, we're working with them and the Mayor's Office of Housing and the architects to develop plans to bring the housing online and there is a particular urgency, because one of the building is in very good shape and could be converted to affordable housing quite quickly, so we are working with them to get that quickly to get them moving. That is at 1055 Pine Street. Thirdly, we are looking at the status of environmental review application that was submitted a few months ago. I think we’ve told you, that there might be some amendments to the EIR that has to be made. We're looking at that and the updated project description, so staff at the environmental planning group is reviewing that right now, and we are trying to quickly determine the level of environmental review that might be needed. And lastly, and per the agenda today, you’ll be -- we'll be discussing their Institutional Master Plan, as just as an informational item. We not asking you to close the hearing, and therefore accept it, but we are simply asking you to review it today as an informational item, so that we can take testimony and hear our thoughts and bring it back to you at a future date. So that's the statues of the report with the Academy. We're working on a diligently, as we suggested earlier in a realistic schedule, we hope November 2ndworks. We don't for sure at this point. We will look at it very carefully. I don't disagree with the frustration about the delays here, but the good news is we're making progress, and particularly on the housing site, I think, we're really pushing hard to make those projects happen, so, I am hoping we can have good news for you in the next few weeks on that. Thank you.
Second thing I wanted to tell you about, some of the regional activity, you might remember that there has been a lot of discussion over the last year about the merger of the staff of ABAG and MTC. That merger in fact, did take place and it was effective as of July 1st, so as of now, there is one staff organization, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, but there are still two boards, the ABAG Executive Committee that I sit on and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, still sit as a separate board. They are products of State Law, so, that will have to change in order to change to Board structure, but the staffs are now merged and working as one, obviously, that was challenging to do that, there were different personnel classifications and budgets, all of that had to be worked, that all happened as of July 1st, and only one person lost their job as a result of that. All staff at ABAG were able to be accommodated within MTC. Secondly, Last night the two boards in fact voted, in Plan Bay Area, the latest iteration of Plan Bay Area that was supported last night. I think, of interest of this Commission was the two hour discussion, that we had about the Brisbane site. The Brisbane – many members Council and the Mayor of the Brisbane objected to the plan’s designation of the Bayland site to accommodate 4,000 units of housing and there was a very robust conversation about that, and in the end the board approved the plan with the 4,000 units on that site and with the recognition that rightly or wrongly Plan Bay Area does not require that, does not force that, that local controls still hangs, still stands, but it doesn’t make that site as a priority development area, that could accommodate 4,400 units of housing. The other very interesting aspect of the Plan Bay Area that was just approved is the action plan. The plan acknowledges that with the growth that is projected in this region that housing affordability displacement will continue to be a problem. The MTC has set a up region wide housing panel to talk about these issues more robustly, it is called CASA, the City is sitting in that panel. We are looking at different ways of bringing more regional resources into affordable housing, and into housing production in general, and I'm looking forward to reporting to you in the next few months how that is going. Thank you.That is my presentation. Thank you.
10.Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission
Land Use Committee:
·170516 Planning Code - Medical Cannabis Dispensaries in Supervisorial District 11. Sponsor: Safai. Staff: Sanchez.
This past Monday, the Land Use Committee heard Supervisor Safai’s ordinance that would cap the number of MCDs in his district at 3. Commissioner’s you heard this item on July 20 and voted to recommend approval with modifications.  The modification was to impose a citywide interim moratorium on the approval of MCDs until the adoption of more comprehensive cannabis controls citywide.
At the hearing, public comment mainly came from residents of District 11 who stressed the need for a cap.  They contended that some existing MCDs are poorly operated and create nuisances for adjacent businesses and residences.  Further, a large number of MCDs have and are seeking to locate in D11.
After taking public comment, the committee member’s spoke of the need for Supervisors to be responsive to their constituent’s needs; however, both Supervisors Peskin and Tang felt that these controls should be reconsidered once the City adopts city-wide controls for Adult Cannabis. The Committee then voted to forward the Ordinance to the Full Board with a positive recommendation as a committee report.
·170750 General Plan Amendments – One Oak Street Project. Sponsor: Planning Commission. Staff: Perry.
·170751 Planning Code, Zoning Map – One Oak Street Project. Sponsor: Planning Commission. Staff: Perry.
Also on the land use agenda was the GP and zoning map amendments for the project at 1 Oak Street. Commissioner’s you heard this item on June 15 and recommended approval. At the land use hearing there were four speakers in favor of the proposed amendments and nine that spoke against. There was little discussion on the item from the committee members. The City attorney discussed some clerical changes that needed to happen to the ordinance; however they had not yet been drafted. In the end the Committee voted to send the item to the Full Board without recommendation. Supervisor Peskin suggested this type of referral in order to signal to the full board that those clarifying amendments still needed to be made.
Full Board:
·170693 Planning Code - Child Care Facilities.Sponsors: Yee; Tang and Ronen. Staff: Nickolopoulos. Continued to September 5 so that the ordinance could be reconciled with recent changes to Article 7.
·170834 Planning Code - Inclusionary Affordable Housing Fee and Dwelling Unit Mix Requirements.Sponsors: Breed; Kim, Peskin, Safai and Tang. Staff: Rodgers, Bintliff.
The duplicated inclusionary Ordinance was amended, again, to add language that would limit a required affordability study for rezoning and SUDs that increased the development potential to only those that have areas of 5 acres or more. The amendments were added unanimously and then item passed its first read.
·170093 Planning Code - Establish Fee for Monitoring of Student Housing - Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development.Sponsor: Mayor. Staff: D. Sanchez. PASSED Second Read
·170692 General Plan Amendments – Implementing the City’s Vision Zero Policy Regarding Pedestrian Safety.Sponsor: Planning Commission. PASSED Second Read
·170820 Planning Code – Valencia Street Neighborhood Commercial Transit District Zoning Control Table.  Sponsor: Mayor.PASSED Second Read
·170790 Hearing - Appeal of Conditional Use Authorization - Proposed Project at 824 Hyde Street. Staff: Foster.
Also on the Board’s agenda was the CU appeal for a proposed hotel at 827 Hyde Street. The proposed project would construct a 6-story over basement, 33-room tourist hotel. The site was previously occupied by an apartment building that was destroyed by a fire. Commissioners, you heard this item on June 1 of this year and voted 4-3 to approve the CU authorization.
13 speakers spoke in favor of the appeal. Only the project sponsor spoke in favor of the project. The appellant was Chris Schulman who represents the Lower Polk Neighborhood Association. The appellant felt that the site would be better used as housing, and not a hotel, since the site had been an apartment building prior to the fire that destroyed it.
The Board seemed to agree and voted unanimously to disapprove the CU authorization.
·170808 Hearing - Appeal of Determination of Community Plan Evaluation – 1726 - 1730 Mission Street.Staff: Gibson, Navarrete, Li. Continued to September 26.
·170808 Hearing - Appeal of Community Plan Evaluation – 1850 Bryant Street.Staff: Gibson, Navarrete, Horner. Continued to September 12
·170516 Planning Code – Medical Cannabis Dispensaries in Supervisorial District 11. Sponsor: Safai. Staff: D Sánchez.Passed on first read with a 9-2 vote and Supervisors Kim and Fewer voting no.
Introductions:
·170864 Planning Code, Zoning Map - Pier 70 Special Use District.Sponsors: Mayor, Cohen. Staff: Sucre
·BF TBD Zoning - Interim Moratorium on Medical Cannabis Dispensaries.Sponsor: Cohen. Staff: Starr
BOARD OF APPEALS:
The Board of Appeals did met last night, one item that maybe of interest to the Commission is 473 Haight Street. You heard this as a discretionary review about a year ago, it was making changes to an existing MCD. It would have been Good Fellows being converted into Spark, they were relocating it has been divided as retail in the front, and MCD in the back their switching those, slightly expanding the uses. That building permit was appealed to the Board of Appeals, it was first heard in May, the Board expressed concern about intensification of the use, they were concerns because – we didn’t know this at the time, but the retail component in the back, wouldn’t have been publicly accessible, in order to get, you have to go through the MCD, which you could only do if you had and MCD card. So, the Board had concerns about this and rightly so, and had suggested that they switch it back, that the MCD is at the back, the retail is in the front, they still do the same amount of expansion, but the retail component – the publicly accessible retail component is at the front.I think that was a great idea, wished we’d have thought of it ourselves back last year, but they unanimously voted to make those changes, although Vice President Fung thought, that it wasn’t an intensification himself, did vote to make those changes to allow the changes be made to the permit. Thank you.
