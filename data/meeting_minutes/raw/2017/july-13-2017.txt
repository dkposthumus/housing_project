C.COMMISSION MATTERS
7.Commission Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements.Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Johnson:
So, I just want to make note that the Examiner had an article out on Wednesday that Supervisor Peskin have asked the City Attorney to investigate a vacancy tax, to see potential legal avenues for instituting one. We'll see where that proposal goes if anywhere, but I think, it is enlighten, is great that the conversation is moving to the next level. I think that potentially it could be a good tool for San Francisco, and it is good to hear that again, if you say something over and over again for years on end, sometimes it goes someplace. So, now I have to come up with the next thing to talk about, and I'm you know open to ideas people. So, just I want to put that out there. Thanks again to all the Supervisors.
Commissioner Moore:
After 10 years of mentioning, I'm very glad to see it happen myself, I want to ask another question, it is question to the Department, directed to the Director, is there a site where people can track where ADU's are being applied for? At this moment there is a lot of non-permitted construction activity in the City and sometimes you see something, and it kind of looks at least, at first -- a glimpse a little bit strange, so I tried to find out on myself on the website, there was not but no ability at all, zero, and I'm kind of curious as to whether or not it would be in everybody's interest to be able to see what has been approved, what is in progress and is permitted to move forward.
Director Rahaim:
Commissioners, I don't think we have a website specifically devoted to ADUs, you would have to go but address by address. I would say we've approved almost 300 and there another 500 or 600 in the pipeline there is quite a number that are coming through, but it is an interesting idea, I'll talk to staff whether we can pull that as a separate building type, and have something on web to show that.
Commissioner Moore:
Since this falls in dual responsibility between Planning and DBI, sort of speak on fast track that would be great to have that particular element of both bodies coordinated, so that people can really see that something is proceeding legally and since there is not requirement on any construction site to have permit pasted, you walk by things and you say, what is really going on here?I think, it would be really hopeful for the public to have confidence that what is permitted is properly noticed, so people don't have to guess.
Commissioner Richards:
Just one question -- one thought on what you just said you need a job card posted, which has a building permit number on all construction.

9.Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission
Land Use Committee:
·170693 Planning Code - Child Care Facilities. Sponsors: Yee; Tang and Ronen. Staff: Nickolopoulos.
At Monday’s land use hearing, the Committee heard the Child Care ordinance. This ordinance would allow residential uses and Child Care Facility uses to share required open space; make Child Care Facilities principally permitted in most zoning districts; remove certain notice requirements for Child Care Facilities; and make other conforming changes. Commissioners, you heard this item on May 18, 2017 and voted unanimously to recommend approval.
Public comments at the Land Use Committee echoed public comments at the Planning Commission, which focused on the need for child care facilities and delays caused by the permitting process. Committee members did not have any questions about the Ordinance. Supervisor Tang moved that this ordinance be recommended, and this motion passed unanimously.
·170760 Planning Code - Inclusionary Affordable Housing Fee and Dwelling Unit Mix Requirements. Sponsors: Kim; Peskin. Staff: Rodgers, Bintliff. Item 4
This week, the Inclusionary Ordinance was back before both the Land Use Committee. The Planning Commission last considered the ordinance last week on July 6, 2017. At that time you made recommendations on an additional “new material modification”. The new requirement would be that inclusionary projects would have to have no more than 30% of the units as studio units. This maximum cap on studio units is in addition to the requirement that at least 25% of the total units shall be at least two-bedroom units, and at least 10% of the total units shall be at least three-bedroom units.
At your hearing, you recommended approval of the Inclusionary ordinance with no specific recommendation on a studio cap, until further study.The BOS did modify the ordinance after hearing your recommendation.
This week the Committee filed the Ordinance that contained the cap on studios and stated that further amendments would be made to the version pending before the Full BOS.
And at Tuesday’s BOS hearing, the Board amended the legislation to remove the cap, and to require that “For any affordable units available to households in the highest AMI tier, studio units shall have a minimum occupancy of two people.”
Full Board:
·170269 Planning Code, Zoning Map - Corona Heights Large Residence Special Use District.Sponsor: Sheehy. Staff: Butkus. PASSED Second Read
·161351 Planning Code - Inclusionary Affordable Housing Fee Requirements.Sponsors: Breed; Kim, Peskin, Safai and Tang. Staff: Rodgers, Bintliff. PASSED First Read with the amendments stated earlier.
·170430 Planning Code - Landmark Designation - 1970 Ocean Avenue (aka El Rey Theater).Sponsors: Yee; Peskin. Staff: Ferguson. Passed First Read
·1704343 Planning Code - Construction of Accessory Dwelling Units.Sponsor: Peskin. Staff: Haddadan. Passed First Read
·170569 Extending Interim Zoning Controls - Signs in Transit Center District Plan Area and Between Folsom, Harrison, Essex and Second Streets.Sponsor: Kim. Staff: Rodgers. Adopted
·170718 Hearing - Appeal of Determination of Exemption From Environmental Review - Proposed SFMTA - Upper Market Street Safety Project.Staff: Wietgrefe.
Last on the agenda was the environmental appeal of the Upper Market Street Safety Project. This project has been in the works for few years now and aims to increase safety and comfort for people using various modes of transportation along and across Market Street, from Castro Street to Octavia Boulevard. Upper Market Street is a high injury corridor, and this project is an outgrowth of the City’s Vision Zero policy. Proposed improvements include new bulb outs, paint protected bike lanes (which don’t really work), a car protected bike lane from Octavia to Buchanan (which do work), reworking loading zones, as well as other improvements.
The Concerns from the appellant included potential piecemealing of the project, cumulative impacts, and fire department aerial ladder access due to the presence of overhead wires. The department found that the SFMTA did not improperly piecemeal the project; no significant cumulative impacts would occur; and the presence of overhead wires is not an unusual circumstance. Therefore, a categorical exemption was the appropriate level of evaluation.
No one from the public spoke in favor of the appellant and approximately 10 members of the public spoke in favor of rejecting the appeal. While the supervisors instructed the city agencies to more effectively work together on addressing the concerns raised by the appellant, the supervisors ultimately rejected the appeal 11-0.
Introductions:
·This week the Mayor introduced an ordinance that would fix a clerical error in the Article 7 ordinance. At some point after the ordinance was transmitted to the clerk the entire zoning control table for the Valencia Street NCT was inadvertently removed from the ordinance. Fortunately, the piece that disappeared was something that was in the ordinance you voted on so the item will not come back to you unless I hear differently from this commission. We were also able to get the fix ordinance drafted, signed to form and introduced on Tuesday. The Board President has waived the 30-day hold, and the item is scheduled for Monday’s land use hearing as a Committee report. If all goes to plan, it should be through the Board before they go on recess, and effective about 4 weeks after the Article 7 ordinance becomes effective. In the interim the ZA has made a determination that the last zoning control table for the District will be used in place of the new table.

Georgia Schuttish:
On July 24, 2014 Commissioners concerned with granting DR allowing merger in Inner Richmond creating a RM-1, 1600 square foot SFD.
Commissioner Antonini referenced Duncan Street approval which was on same Agenda, RH-2, SFD at 3,500 square feet.
Within the year of approved merger… on same block as merger in Inner Richmond, a unit lost in a remodel: Absorbed by 3,000 square feet SFD sold for speculative profit…
City can do two things to deal with the issue of density in the Residential Neighborhoods AND preserveexisting relatively affordablehousing.
1.Eliminate the loophole of Section 317 (b) (7)
2.Joint meeting with BIC: Discuss serial permitting; OTC permits.Better coordination between Building and Planning Staff.Better oversigh and use of the SFPIM.Common sense inspections before CFC issue.(Only wine fridge in second kitchen; Whatare connections between units; Where are locks on doors between units, etc?)
