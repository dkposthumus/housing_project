D.DEPARTMENT MATTERS
9.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Good afternoon Commissioners, just one announcement, I thought I'd call to your attention, there was an article in today's, I think in the Chronicle about the MTA's annual survey of commuting preferences, travel preferences in the City. I think what is interesting is, that it shows, that I believe we're making slow but steady progress in that half -- more than half of travel is now on non-private automobiles, which is a significant increase from where we were just a few years ago, and that is with all the growth in the City right now, both the job and residential growth. I think that the work we're all doing, that you're doing, that we are doing in bicycles, and we are doing on alternative forms of transportations is really helping move the needle to a place where we can actually -- ultimately reduce the amount of vehicles on the road. I think that is really good progress. I wanted to call that to your attention, happy to get the actual report on that.
10.Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission
Land Use Committee:
·170930 General Plan - Pier 70 Mixed-Use District Project. Sponsor: Commission. Staff: Sucre. Item 1
·170864 Planning Code, Zoning Map - Pier 70 Special Use District. Sponsors: Mayor; Cohen. Staff: Sucre. Item 2
·170987 Public Trust Exchange Agreement - California State Lands Commission - Pier 70 Project. Sponsors: Mayor; Cohen. Staff: Not Staffed. Item 3
First on the Land Use agenda was the Pier 70 Mixed-Use Project, which include a General Plan Amendment, Zoning Map Amendment, Planning Code Text Amendment, and Development Agreement. This Commission heard these items on August 24, 2017 and recommended to approval with modifications. The modification was a recommendation that the BOS establish a reasonable threshold for office development.
Subsequently, on Oct 16th, Supervisor Cohen introduced amendments to the original Ordinances to establish a cap for the amount of office development, which could be approved at Pier 70.
At the hearing, most of the public comment was positive. The Land Use Committee members asked questions regarding interim uses, the D4D, the completeness of applications, major modifications, the Discretionary Review process, and review of Historic Buildings.
Given the amendments to the original Ordinances, the BOS Land Use Committee continued the item to the hearing on October 23rd.
·170941 Planning Code, Zoning Map - Transit Center Special Sign District.Sponsor: Kim. Staff: D. Sanchez.
Next on the Land Use agenda was the Transit Center District Plan Area Special Sign District. This ordinance seeks to establish new sign controls in the Transbay Transit District.  The new sign controls aim to moderate the size height and illumination of new signs in the area, given the coming influx of residential and open space uses.
On September 14 you heard this Ordinance and voted unanimously to recommend the Ordinance with a minor, clarifying modification.  The modification sought to clarify the terms “park” and “planned park” to ease implementation.
On October 16 the Ordinance was before the Land Use Committee.  By call of the Chair, the Committee moved to continue the item in order to add more clarifying amendment to the ordinance.
Full Board:
·170834 Planning Code - Inclusionary Affordable Housing Fee and Dwelling Unit Mix Requirements. Sponsors: Breed; Kim, Peskin, Safai and Tang.Staff: Rodgers, Bintliff.
At the Full Board this week, the board again made minor revisions to the provisions of the off-site inclusionary housing program; therefore the item had to have its first read again, which passed unanimously.
·170418 Planning Code - Commercial Uses in Polk Street and Pacific Avenue Neighborhood Commercial Districts; Technical and Other Amendments.Sponsor: Peskin. Staff: D. Sanchez.
Supervisor Peskin’s Polk and Pacific Avenue NCD Ordinance was also amended to add a grandfather provision for projects that have received all of their approvals prior to December 31, 2017. With that amendment it passed its first read.
·170782 Planning Code, Zoning Map - Rezoning 1990 Folsom Street.Sponsor: Ronen. Staff: Alexander. Passed First Read
Introductions:
·No new introductions.
BOARD OF APPEALS:
The Board of Appeals did meet last night and considered two items that mighty be of interest, 68 Richardson Avenue where you took DR earlier this year, and required the removal of the roof deck and an additional notch at the second and third floors. The project sponsor appealed this project the Board of Appeals and the Board of Appeals restored the roof deck and corner infill, but imposed conditions prohibiting hot tubs and fire pits on the roof deck. Also, they considered 2226 Green Street, where you took DR, and approved revised plan provided by project sponsor that reduced the size of roof deck. The neighbors appealed this to the Board of Appeals and the Board upheld your decision.
HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:
Good Afternoon, Tim Frye, Department staff, here to share with you one item from yesterday’s Historic Preservation Commission hearing, as you see on the overhead, three public schools were designated pursuant to Article 10 of the Planning Code: Theodore Roosevelt Middle School, Washington High School, and the former Sunshine School. George Washington and Theodore Roosevelt are both significant as work of Master ArchitectTimothy Pflueger, from the New Deal Era, and contain significant murals and art works, on both the interior and the exterior of those properties.Sunshine School is significant as when it was constructed in 1935, it was the first public school for disabled children west of the Rockies. All three of these items will be heard at the Historic Preservation Commission one more time. We will go to the School Board at the end of this month, and then they will move on to the full Board for consideration. That concludes my comments, unless you have any questions.
E.GENERALPUBLIC COMMENT – 15 MINUTES
