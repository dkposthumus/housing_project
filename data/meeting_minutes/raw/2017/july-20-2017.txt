8.Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission
Land Use Committee:
·170692 General Plan Amendments - Implementing the City’s Vision Zero Policy Regarding Pedestrian Safety. Sponsor: Planning Commission. Staff: Langlois.
At this Monday’s land use hearing, the Committee heard the General Plan Amendments for Implementing the City’s Vision Zero Policy Regarding Pedestrian Safety. Commissioners you heard this item on May 18, 2017 and recommended approval. At the land use hearing, there was only one speaker during public comment that had general concerns about how the City is implementing its vision zero policy. Without much discussion, the Committee voted to forward the ordinance to the Full Board with a positive recommendation as a committee report.
·170820 Planning Code - Valencia Street Neighborhood Commercial Transit District Zoning Control Table. Sponsor: Mayor. Staff: Starr.
Next on the agenda was the trailing legislation for the Article 7 Reorganization ordinance. This ordinance would put back the Valencia Street NCT zoning control table into the planning code, which was inadvertently removed from the Article 7 ordinance. There was no public comment at the hearing, and only minor questions from the Committee. The Committee then voted to forward the item to the Board with a positive recommendation as a committee report.
·170783 Extending Interim Zoning Controls - Indoor Agriculture. Sponsor: Mayor. Staff: Starr.
Last on the Land Use agenda, was the extension of the Interim Zoning Controls for Indoor Agriculture. At the Land Use hearing, Lisa Pagan from the Mayor’s office gave a presentation on the item and the need for extending the interim controls. The Interim Controls were passed to help protect the City’s existing industrial spaces from being over concentrated with cannabis cultivation facilities. The interim controls state that an over-concentration of cannabis cultivation businesses may have a negative impact on the character of neighborhoods within PDR zoning districts. The interim controls were put in place to provide the City time to study the issue of cannabis cultivation, and decide if additional regulations on cannabis cultivation in San Francisco are needed.
At the hearing, here wasn’t any public comment. Supervisor Peskin proposed an amendment to have the expiration date at 12/31/17 instead of 6-months. This amendment passed unanimously and then the amended resolution was forwarded to the Full Board with a positive recommendation as a committee report.
Full Board:
·170093 Planning Code - Establish Fee for Monitoring of Student Housing - Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development.Sponsor: Mayor. Staff: D. Sanchez. Passed First Read
·161351 Planning Code - Inclusionary Affordable Housing Fee Requirements.Sponsors: Breed; Kim, Peskin, Safai and Tang. Staff: Rodgers, Bintliff.
For the Inclusionary Affordable Housing ordinance, the file was duplicated so that the recommendations from OCII could be added to the ordinance without slowing down the passage of the main amendments; the original ordinance passed its Second Read and the duplicated file will not need to come back to you for review as you have already considered the amendments proposed by OCII.

HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:
Good afternoon, Commissioners Tim Frye, Department staff, here to share with you a few items from yesterday’s Historic Preservation Commission hearing. The Commission provided review and comment on proposed legislation sponsored -- ordinance sponsored by Supervisor Peskin for Commercial Uses in North Beach. I believe it is on the calendar for later today and Diego Sanchez will go over the HPC’s comments on that time. The Commission also unanimously approved an addition to the Asian Art Museum, historically known as the Public Library, at 200 Larkin Street. This is an addition to accommodate a larger exhibition hall and conservation space for the museum. The item had been before the Architectural Review Committee twice and the Commission was very supportive of the revisions made to the project in response to the ARC’s comments. The Commission also reviewed a National Register nomination for Sacred Heart Church and its complex. As you know, this complex is also being proposed for local landmark designation that is going to be heard at the HPC in October, but no reason why the National Register nomination couldn't move forward, so the project sponsor and the property owners are in full support of national registered nominations moving forward to the National Parks Service in D.C., and that was supported unanimously. Also, another item you’ll see on a future hearing is a—at a future hearing is 888 Tennessee. This is a demolition of a non-contributing building and the construction of 87,000 square foot new building within the Dogpatch Landmark District. This item went also before the Architectural Review Committee, previously those changes to the design were made and the Commission fully supported the revised design for its compatibility with the landmark district. And then finally, the Commission initiated landmark designation on Third Baptist Church complex, here on the overhead. The complex is already technically designated as a contributing feature to the Alamo Square Landmark District, however, its history and it's known forth significant contributions to the political, economic and social advancement of African-Americans in San Francisco, has not been formally recognized, so, this individual recognition will allow for that and in particular shine light on Reverend Frederick Douglass Haynes, Sr.’s work, who within the Western Addition neighborhood. So, the Commission unanimously approved the initiation of the landmark designation, there was a large number of public speakers in support of the designation and we are hoping to bring it to the Commission for its recommendation to the Board of Supervisors on August 16th, in anticipation of a celebration of the church is hosting in September. That concludes my comments, unless you have any questions.
BOARD OF APPEALS:
The Board of Appeals did meet last night and considered one item of interest to the Commission. The Board of Appeals heard an appeal of a building permit to authorize a MCD at 2442 Bayshore Boulevard. The Planning Commission heard this as a mandatory DR in January and approved the subject permit with conditions. The appellant argued that the subject property can't be used as a MCD because there were two community facilities which primarily serve people under 18 years of age with a1000 feet of the subject property. This concern was also raised at the time of the DR hearing, however, the Department has consistently found that these uses did not primarily serve people under 18 years of age. Three of the five members of the Board disagreed with the Department findings; however, four votes are required to overturn the Department’s action. As such, the Planning Commission’s decision to approve the MCD was upheld by matter of law.
E.GENERALPUBLIC COMMENT – 15 MINUTES
At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting.Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
