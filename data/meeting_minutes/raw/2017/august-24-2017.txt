Commissioner Moore:
I want to share a funny moment with you, we mentioning – we directing the intent of main stream it is difficult, in any city like San Francisco, Market Street where we image that is complicated, it requires creativity. Can you read that? It gives me a huge laugh. For the audience, can you all see it? It is in English, it says: Make the Konigstrasse Great Again, which means: Make King Street Great Again. I thought it was a brilliant way of advertising.
Commissioner Koppel:
I want to make some comments on a trip I went on last week. I attended a friend wedding in Colorado. While there, I happenstance into a couple of dispensaries to do a little bit of investigating of my own, I don’t see that been very funny, Commissioner Richards. This is serious business up here. I was in a business investigation trip and I had a lot of questions and I got a lot of information on how they are doing this in Colorado. So, I did notice, once arriving in Colorado, the roads were immaculate; there was very little litter on the street, just a very clean, up-kept presence throughout the entire State. I did ask some of the people behind the counters how they tax, and simply all you need to get into these dispensaries, is a 21 and over ID. I did ask about the difference between recreational, medicinal, and the one thing that stays with me the most, is that they charge a 24% tax on their products. So, that is how they get to have the surplus of money they use for the public benefit, up keep of the roads to address issues that they have with homelessness and cleanliness, and they still have lots of money left over. I’ve seen signs over the freeways and roads, that clean-up effort is sponsored by the cannabis collectives, and that they’ve figured out a way for really utilize it this industry to benefit the cities and State of Colorado. So, hopefully at some point, whenever it does happen, we do get everything dialed in here we can utilize it to our benefit and make it most out of the industry.
Commissioner Melgar:
I also wanted to make a report and a request to the Department. So, on July 22, I was invited to go on a neighborhood tour by neighbors in the Excelsior and it was a tour organized by the PODER and the Filipino Community Center, and various neighbors in District 11 who we usually don’t hear from, so, I was really happy to go along. It was group of about 15 neighbors, mostly women, almost all working in the service sector, all of them immigrants, both Latino and Filipino and some Chinese. And we went to look at and talk about the laundromat that was busted for having folks living in the basement illegally, and we went to a couple sites under development where there are luxury condominium units going up on Mission Street, and then the Balboa Yard site that will affordable housing. Had a fascinating discussion that it was really well informed about the hopes and dreams of those neighbors, for their neighborhood, for the future, for their children, for accessing affordable housing and services, and for both preserving and making progress on what happens in the neighborhood. So, I feel is not often that we hear those voices, the voices of people who are service workers, and immigrants, and women. And what they requested specifically is to be included formally in the planning process, in the working group that is taking up the Excelsior issues. So, I’d ask the Department to honor that request. I feel like it is – you know it’s funny, there is been an article, that has gone viral on Facebook about planning in the City and how is dominated my male voices, I am sure we’ve all read it – I feel like that sometimes. I also feel, it is usually, mostly planning and land use decisions are dominated by the educated, by those of who the time and the access, by those who can read all that stack of stuff, that we go through, and I would say, folks who does not have that, have other things, that area just as valuable, which is the perspective that comes from living in those neighborhoods, that – there is no substitute for. I think that I’d urge the Department, to revisit the composition of that working group and to make sure all voices are heard and – the efforts to preserve is to make progress on those neighborhoods issues are honored. Thank you.
Commissioner Richards:
My apologies to Commissioner Koppel, I thought you were joking, and that’s why I gave you the good laugh, but I see you were actually serious. Closed Commission’s comments on an item of levity as well as Commissioner Moore opened it. I don’t know, I was coming back from Pennsylvania on Monday, I landed in the city at about 9:45, I wanted to come and rush here to see the eclipse, which I didn’t because it was foggy, but in my Twitter feed was a hilarious little, kind of cartoon from the Bay City Beacon, I’ll give them a shot out, because I really laughed my head off, titled of Bay City Beacon was: Planning Commission Denies Eclipse Permit, the sub-heading, the subtitled was: Moon Would Catch Shadows on Parks Violating Prop K. So, I thought that was really, really cute and I actually told the editor Mr. Aguilar, I thought that was hilarious. So, if we can’t laugh at ourselves, who we can laugh at?
D.DEPARTMENT MATTERS
11.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Thanks Jonas, Commissioners, at an hour and half in, welcome back from your break, I hope you had a good break; it was a good introduction back to Commission land. A couple things, jus if I may response to Commissioner Melgar, I will talk to the staff, who was organizing those meetings, that task force was organizing in conjunction with Supervisor Safai’s office. So, we will – we will look at that list, and see if can broaden it to include some of the community members that you were talking about, your point is well taken. Secondly, I just want to let you know that I have joined the Resilient by Design Executive Board. This is the board that is looking at the sea level rise competition for the Bay Area, if you recall this is modeled after the New York competition that happened after Hurricane Sandy. And the competition here in the Bay Area has been founded primarily by the Rockefeller Foundation and I joined the board to kind of oversee that work. They are in the process of selecting the teams that will be associated with the ten sites that will be look at throughout the region. So, I am excited about that work, we think is precedent setting, and really will help us set some stages for future thinking about sea level rise and how we address some of the issues in the Bay Area and other places as well. That concludes my report. Thank you.

BOARD OF APPEALS:
The Board of Appeals met last night, and considered three items, that may be of interest to the Commission. The first is 473 Haight Street, the Board heard a rehearing request related to the building permit for the MCD of this property; however, the requestor did not attend the hearing, and the Board denied the rehearing request. The second was 153 Clipper Street. The Board heard an appeal of the building permit for this property, which was heard by this Commission as a DR earlier this year. In that hearing the Commission took DR, and removed the deck in front of the property. The appeal was filed by the neighbor across the street, who argued that the flat roof area could easily be use as a roof deck, the Department noted that all plans were consistent with the Commission’s decision, and did not include a roof deck. The Board unanimously denied the appeal. The third at 310 Duncan Street was an appeal of a suspension request and notice of violation for the subject property, which was found, that the property owner misrepresented the existing conditions of the subject property and reduced the previously existing second unit more than 25% without the require CU for dwelling unit merger. The Board unanimously denied the appeal and held the suspension and notice of violation.

580 GREEN STREET- north side of Green Street, at the intersection of Columbus Avenue and Stockton Street; Lot 020A in Assessor’s Block 0116 (District 3) - Request forConditional Use Authorizationpursuant to Planning Code Sections 121.2, 178(e)(5), 303, and 722.51 to permit a change of use of a nonconforming use and nonconforming use size. The subject property previously contained a bank (d.b.a. “Citibank”) (a Financial Services Use) and the proposed project would convert the existing 8,405 square foot commercial tenant space into a medical clinic (d.b.a. “North East Medical Services” or “NEMS”) (a Medical Service Use). In service of activating the frontages along Green and Stockton Streets, NEMS proposes two (2) Accessory Use retail spaces totaling approximately 500 square feet, to be used as Retail Sales and Service Uses (e.g. patient consultation; sales of medical devices, or gift shop). Because the existing Financial Services Use is nonconforming and exceeds the use size limits of the Code, the existing use and use size are both considered nonconforming. Even though the proposed Medical Service Use is a principally permitted use in the North Beach Neighborhood Commercial District (NCD), the change of use from the nonconforming use requires Conditional Use Authorization. Minor interior tenant improvements are proposed as part of the project, with no expansion of the existing building envelope.The subject property is located within the North Beach NCD (Neighborhood Commercial) Zoning District, the North Beach Financial Service, Limited Financial Service, and Business or Professional Service Subdistrict, the North Beach Special Use District,Telegraph Hill and North Beach Residential Special Use District; and 48-X Height and Bulk District.This action constitutes the Approval Action for the project for the purposes of CEQA, pursuant to San Francisco Administrative Code Section31.04(h).
