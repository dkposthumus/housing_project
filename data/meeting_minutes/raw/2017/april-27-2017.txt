10.Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission
Land Use Committee:
·170206 Planning Code - Off-Street Parking and Loading Requirements.Sponsor: Farrell. Staff: D. Sanchez.
First on the Land Use Committee’s agenda was the Off-Street Parking and Loading Ordinance, sponsored by Supervisor Farrell.  This Ordinance proposes to clarify, consolidate and update the off-street parking and loading requirements in the Planning Code with the changes made under Phase One of the Planning Code Reorganization project.  The Planning Commission initiated the Ordinance on June 30, 2016 and then on September 8, 2016 recommended approval of the Ordinance.
At the Land Use Hearing, Supervisor Farrell introduced an amendment of the whole, which included fixing typographical errors that arose due to changes in the Planning Code since the September adoption.
During deliberation, Supervisor Peskin asked Staff to clarify the minor substantive changes in the Ordinance, commenting that he felt the term “minor substantive changes” was an oxymoron.  Satisfied with Staff’s answer, Supervisor Peskin made a motion to recommend the ordinance to the full board of supervisors.
The only speaker during public comment was staff from MTA, who spoke in favor of the Ordinance. The land use committee then recommended the Ordinance as amended to the full Board of Supervisors.
·160281 Planning Code - Dwelling Unit Mix Requirements. Sponsors: Yee; Farrell. Staff: Starr.
Next on the agenda was Supervisor Yee’s Dwelling Unit Mix ordinance that adds an additional option for the dwelling unit mix requirement for large buildings in specified zoning districts. The proposal would allow developers to have a mix of two- and three-bedroom units that result in no less than 35% of the total number of proposed units having two or three bedrooms, with at least 10% of the total number of proposed units having three bedrooms. Commissioners, you heard this item on June 16, 2016 and recommended approval with modifications. Your proposed modifications included:
1.To Provide the Dwelling Unit Mix Option for Bedrooms in RTO, Hayes Gough NCT, Upper Market NCT, and NCT-3 Districts
2.To include a minimum percentage floor for three bedroom units in the new option; and
3.To Monitor Projects that choose the new bedroom option and include the data in the annual Housing Inventory starting in 2019.
Since you heard this legislation, the proposed new option was amended from one that required a unit mix that resulted in“at least 50% of the bedrooms in units that have more than one bedroom”to “no less than 35% of the total number of proposed units having two or three bedrooms with at least 10% of the total number of proposed units having three bedrooms.” While markedly different than the original proposal, this change fulfilled the Commission’s second recommendation by providing a floor for 3-bedroom units. The other two recommendations were also added to the Ordinance.
After closing public comment, the Committee voted to recommend this item to the Full Board.
·160019 Administrative Code, Planning Code - Designated Child Care Units.Sponsors: Yee; Peskin. Staff: Starr.
Next on the agenda was Supervisor Yee’s ordinance that would allow developers to meet their childcare fee obligations by dedicating an inclusionary unit as a childcare facility. Commissioner’s you heard this item way back in October of 2015 when the ordinance’s main goal was to establish a citywide child care impact fee. At the time, you voted to recommend approval with modifications. The proposed modifications were to:
1.Remove the Designated Child Care Unit (DCCU) from this ordinance and consider the DCCU section as a separate piece of legislation. This recommendation was intended as an add-on to Staff’s recommendation that a separate program be created for this purpose, rather than using the Inclusionary program and creating a new de facto preference for the inclusionary program; and
2.Clarify Child Care Fees levied in Area Plans remain in Area Plans.
When this went to the Board in 2015, Supervisor Yee did duplicate the file. He also took the dedicated child care unit piece out of the ordinance, and he amended the ordinance to clarify Child Care Fees levied in Area Plans remain in Area Plans. However, in the duplicated file he did not create a separate program for the dedicated child care unit. Instead this program would allow a developer of a project with 10 or more affordable units to provide one or more Designated Child Care Units in lieu of paying the Residential Child Care Impact Fee; such designated Child Care Unit(s) may be an inclusionary unit.
At the hearing there were about a half dozen public commenters, mainly in support of the ordinance and expressing the need for more child care options in the City. The item was ultimately continued to the call of the chair so that Supervisor Yee could work more closely with the Mayor’s Office of Housing on the plan’s details.
·170203 Planning Code - Article 7 Reorganization; Technical and Other Amendments.Sponsor: Mayor. Staff: Starr.
·170204 Planning Code - Deletion of Duplicate Definitions and Outdated Article 7 Zoning Control Tables.Sponsor: Mayor. Staff: Starr
Last on the Land Use agenda was the Article 7 Reorganization ordinance. Commissioner’s you heard this item on February 2 of this year and voted to recommend approval, with the direction to allow amendments if they preserve existing code requirements.
At the land use hearing, staff gave a full presentation of the proposed ordinance and the public outreach to date. Staff also proposed an amendment of the whole, which better clarify MCD and Formula Retail requirements. These amendments were approved by the Committee. Public comment included only a few speakers, mostly in opposition. The commenters appeared to be misinformed about what the ordinance actually does, and staff was afforded the opportunity by Supervisor Tang to correct some of those misconceptions.
At the request of Supervisor Peskin, the item was then continued to the call of the chair so that he could continue to evaluate the proposal. Staff has requested a meeting with his office to discuss his issues, and is currently awaiting a response. This item is likely coming back to the Land Use Committee on May 15.
Full Board:
·170125 Planning Code - Construction of Accessory Dwelling Units. Sponsor: Peskin. Staff: Haddadan.Passed First Read
·170313 Hearing - Appeal of Determination of Exemption From Environmental Review - Proposed Project at 953 Treat Avenue.Staff: Greving, Tam, Navarrete.
Last on the agenda was the appeal hearing on the environmental determination for the project at 953 Treat Avenue. On March 25, 2016, the Department issued a Categorical Exemption for the demolition of the existing one-story, single-family residence and the construction of 6 new dwelling units. The project also required Conditional Use authorization, which was approved by the Planning Commission on February 16, 2017.
The appellants of the Categorical Exemption contested the Planning Department finding that the 1887 Italianate cottage was not a historic resource under CEQA. The appellant’s argument focused on three issues related to the subject property: 1) that survey findings from 2010 were contradictory, 2) that it was eligible under criterion 1 (events) as a good example of this property type, and 3) that it was also eligible under criterion 2 (individuals), for its association with John Center.
Planning Staff explained that survey findings were not contradictory. The confusion over the survey findings was a result of an error in the Planning Department’s database. Planning Staff explained that the subject property was not eligible under Criterion 1, as there were better more intact examples of this property type in the Mission. Staff also showed that there were insufficient ties with John Center to establish significance under Criterion 2.
Supervisors’ questions focused on getting a better understanding of the survey process and history of evaluations for the subject property. Supervisors also sought additional information regarding the methodology for evaluating the property.
There was significant public comment both for and against the appeal. Comments included differences in professional opinions among qualified historic preservation professionals, as well as individuals expressing support for the proposed project that would add new housing units to the neighborhood.
The Board ultimately ended up upholding the Planning Department’s categorically exempt and denying the appeal. The final vote was 7 to 3, with Supervisors Kim, Peskin, and Ronen dissenting.
