C.COMMISSION MATTERS
8.  Consideration of Adoption:
9. Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Moore:I believe that gas stations, their equal locations throughout neighborhoods, is a critical policy issue. I’d like to see that the Department gives us an overview about where gas stations are, how many there are and if any of those gas stations are under consideration of closure. I think we're getting into a critical numerical thing here, particularly at night when gas stations are quite far away from those people who may need gas at later hours it becomes often a difficult issue to find one. I’d like to put the issue of laundromats also on that discussion. San Francisco is, in many neighborhoods wood frame construction, two and three stories where it really is impossible to ask unit occupants, residents or owners to put washing machines on upper floors because the structure of those buildings are just not built to accommodate washing machines and dryers. So I'd kind of like to see we’re getting a better understanding of an equal distribution where those facilities are. We do not have to make policy out of it but I'd like to get an overview of where critical infrastructure in the City is that is built the way it is not the way we want it to be.
President Hillis:Thank you. We’ll add those items to our action item lists.
Commissioner Richards:Along the same lines of Commissioner Moore saying, I recall back in the Market-Octavia Planning process where we had all these gas stations in the Upper Market, pretty much on every corner, it was almost like a suburban neighborhood, which it kind of read as and there was somebody from the neighborhood who said what happens when all the gas stations go away? I kind of laughed, I was like you're crazy they’re not all going away, there still be cars and there still going to be gas stations and we've been seeing this over and over week after week month after month. We started with 79 gas stations when I started on the commission; I don't how many we have left, whether it’s 40 or 50 or 60, but I also think that it not only becomes an issue of a complete city with the kind of services that required to keep the city functioning, but also becomes for me a social equity issue because now there are times that I'm driving in somebody else's neighborhood, polluting all along the way and stopping in that neighborhood where there's still a gas station and generally in a community of concern that I trek into their neighborhood to get my gas, I don’t think it's that fair; same with laundromats. I pulled number seven off the calendar because here we have another laundromat going out of business and I too share Commissioner Moore’s concern that not everybody can afford to have a delivery service to do their laundry, not everybody could afford to actually get up and down the steps physically or have somebody to do their laundry for them when they go in the neighborhood. I'm worried as well about laundromats and I’ll add a weird one to the list, funeral homes. You can't drive your car, you can't clean your clothes and you can't die apparently in this city, that’s where we're going because pretty soon we'll have no more funeral homes either and I'll just get that out there. Interestingly enough along the same lines while we were on break, Tuesday November 21st, J.K. Dineen wrote an article on the front page of the Chronicle about retail spaces and what's happening with retail spaces. It's interesting because it is not all doom and gloom. There are places in this city where you go they have a thriving retailing environment, Divisidero Street, to most extent Valencia Street; there's place where you go in the City there's dying retail environments or some retail environments that actually throw me back to 2008 and 2009 when we were in the midst of a deep recession; my neighborhood, Castro and Upper Market reminds me of that. He also talks about in the article ways that we can actually fill these spaces up; it's not all, let's get rid of the new urbanism and put housing on all the ground floors. He cites a few success cases like Equity in their three developments, one on Showplace Square another one over there at 1010 Potrero where they’ve already signed 11 leases. So I think we’re willing to take a look at this, I know it’s on our action item list, this whole concept of retail. We’ve got some heavy lifts happening now with Section 317 and some other things but I think maybe next year working with the President or through the Chair and staff, these are some things we really need to kind of bring to the forefront and make some decisions on and figure out what we want to do with these things in the city.
Commissioner Fong:I also want to comment on the gas stations; while I think we all have a goal of maybe having no fossil fuel vehicles in the City at some point, that will be a little bit while and if we can just make sure we have gas stations to get us topped off at least until we get to that point and also making a point that we are a tourist city and there are many people who come into San Francisco with fossil fuel cars and chasing off to different parts of neighborhoods, different parts of the city looking for gas maybe not the best thing. So I think we just want a counting of where we are now and how many more we plan to lose in a five, seven-year outlook on that is.
Commissioner Richards:One other fact, there's another article in the Examiner about on charging stations and it showed different cities in the Bay Area by the amount of cars that are sold new that are electric and San Francisco, I think, ranked almost last at three percent. We still have 97 percent of cars that are not hybrid or electric being sold.
Commissioner Johnson:I was going to say the same thing and I don’t think we could discuss this, hopefully, I won’t say too much. I think gas stations will likely change their purpose just like a lot of the parking spots and parking structures that we have in our city, both residential and stand alone; so I think gas stations are a part of that sort of transformation to San Francisco. So it’s not necessarily about getting rid of them, it may not be, maybe about shrinking them and finding out what is their future purpose.

11. Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission
LAND USE COMMITTEE:
•171134 General Plan Amendment - 1629 Market Street.Sponsor: Commission. Staff: Sucre•170938 Planning Code, Zoning Map - 1629 Market Street Special Use District.Sponsors: Mayor; Kim and Sheehy. Staff: Sucre
First on the Land Use Committee agenda this week were the General Plan, Planning Code and Zoning Map Amendments for the project at 1629 Market Street Project. This Commission voted to approve those items on October 19th of this year. At the Land Use hearing a few people spoke in support of the project during public comment. The Land Use Committee did not have any comments on the project, but did applaud the Project Sponsor on their proposal. The Committee forwarded the project to the Full Board with a positive recommendation.
•170959 Hearing - Housing Costs and Housing Cost Information Tracking by City Departments.Sponsor: Fewer. Staff: Ojeda, Rodgers, Peterson.•170748 Hearing - Planning Department's Housing Balance Report No. 5.Sponsor: Kim. Staff: Ojeda, Rodgers, Peterson.•170992 Bi-Annual Housing Balance Report - May 2017.Sponsor: Kim. Staff: Ojeda, Rodgers, Peterson.
Last on the land use agenda was the combined Bi-Annual Housing Balance Report sponsored by Supervisor Kim and a hearing sponsored by Supervisor Fewer on Housing Costs and Housing Cost Information Tracking. AnMarie Rodgers introduced the items as the new director of citywide policy. She emphasized that good data is critical to good policy making. Teresa Ojeda presented the major points on the Housing Balance Report, focusing particularly on the various elements that make up the housing balance ratio and how it varies by Supervisor district. Pedro Peterson presented information on housing cost trends over time and across the city. He also described the overall economic trends and their impact on housing costs.
Public comment was mostly provided by struggling tenants and tenant advocates on the need for stronger protections and preservation of housing affordability. Supervisors Peskin, Kim, and Fewer said that they want us to add more information to the Housing Balance Report, asking for variations to the existing equation. Supervisor Fewer had asked that the City consider monitoring rental rates as currently done by the City of Berkeley. At the end of the hearing, the Committed unanimously accept the Housing Balance Report and filed the hearing.
FULL BOARD:
•170941 Planning Code, Zoning Map - Transit Center Special Sign District.Sponsor: Kim. Staff: D. Sanchez. PASSED Second Read•170922 Planning Code - Landmark Designation of 2731-2735 Folsom Street (aka Gaughran House).Sponsors: Peskin; Ronen. Staff: Ferguson. Passed First Read•171147 Hearing - Appeal of Determination of Exemption from Environmental Review - SFMTA Hairball Intersection Improvement Project.Staff: Dwyer
The Board also heard an environmental appeal on the Hairball intersection improvement project. The Hairball is the area where Cesar Chavez Street, Bayshore Boulevard, and Potrero Avenue change from city streets to a complex arrangement of bridges and ramps linking with Highway 101.
SFMTA is working on a small project on Jerrold Avenue and Bayshore Boulevard. The project consists of minor restriping to install bicycle lanes, the removal of 10 parking spaces and two loading zones, and the implementation of a parking restriction along Barnveld Avenue.
The Department issued a Class 1 [Existing Facilities] categorical exemption, which was appealed by Mary Miles. Ms. Miles claimed that the department incorrectly issued a Class 1 categorical exemption.
In an uncommon twist, the appellant provided notice the day before the hearing that she would not be attending the hearing, and did not request a continuance of the hearing. In response, staff gave a shortened presentation on the appeal and the Department’s response. Planning Department staff was also supported SFMTA staff. In what was a quick and successful hearing, the exemption determination was upheld on a unanimous vote.
•171041 Planning Code - Cannabis Regulation.Sponsor: Mayor, Sheehy. Staff: Starr
And finally the Board heard the Planning Code and various other Code Amendments for Cannabis Regulations. As you may remember from my last report, the Board continued the item for two weeks to continue to evaluate the proposal and possible amendments.
There were probably four major sticking points with the land use amendments; the first was the distance around sensitive uses. As I’m sure you remember the original ordinance proposed a 600 foot buffer around schools, and this commission voted to increase that to 1000 feet. The ordinance before the Board at the time maintained the 600’ provision, but Supervisor Tang, in response to her constituent’s concerns, proposed an amendment that would increase that to 1000’. This amendment failed on a 6-5 vote. In the end the Board kept the 600’ distance.
The second sticking point was the definition of sensitive uses and in particular whether or not it should include childcare facilities. The original ordinance did not include childcare facilities. Supervisor Tang made a motion to include child care facilities, also in response to concerns from her constituents, but again this amendment failed on a 6-5 vote and the Board end up not including Childcare facilities as a sensitive use. This also means that Recreational Buildings that primarily serve those 18 years or younger is also no longer considered a sensitive use.
The third sticking point was the proposed anti-clustering provision. The original ordinance proposed a 300 foot anti-clustering provision and this commission voted to include what was referred to as the Orbit Option in its place. While there seemed to be a support for the orbit option at the Board, I think the inability to map the orbit option, and that it was untested put it out of favor. In the end the Board voted to increase the anti-clustering provision to 600 feet.
The final sticking point was whether or not certain districts in the city could impose limits on the number of cannabis retailers and mcd, also known as carve-outs. Supervisor Farrell, Tang, Yee, Peskin and Safai all at one point had proposed carve-outs in their district. Supervisor Farrell and Peskin had abandoned those carve-outs prior to Tuesday’s meeting, and did not propose amendments to add them to the final ordinance. Supervisors Tang and Yee proposed to add their carve-outs to the final ordinance, but those amendments failed. Supervisor Ronen then made a motion to remove Supervisor Safai’s carve-out, which places a limit of three MCDs or Cannabis Retailers in the Excelsior Outer Mission NCD. If you recall this carve was added by a separate ordinance and at one point applied to all of District 11. This motion passed on 6-5 vote, which effectively removed all carve-puts from the ordinance.
There were two other amendments of note, both made by Supervisor Peskin. The first was an amendment to require 312 notifications for all Cannabis Retailers, regardless of their zoning district. This motion passed unanimously. This means that all Cannabis Retailers, even if they are located Downtown will be required to do 312 notifications.
The last and perhaps most pertinent amendment to those seeking immediate herbal relief was a provision added to the Planning Code that would allow existing MCD to sell adult use cannabis on a temporary basis starting the day the ordinance becomes effective, which looks like it will be January 5, 2018. This is only a temporary authorization and all MCDs wishing to convert to Cannabis Retail permanently would have to file a change of use application, which is subject to 312 notification. To convert, these businesses are not subject to any location restrictions, but most already conform to the 1000’ rule, and there is no mandatory DR or CU hearing; however, I assume that some of them will be DR’d by the public. MCDs have until March 31, 2018 to apply for the change of use authorization and the temporary permit only lasts until the end of 2018.
So at around 8:30 on Tuesday, after 3 Land Use hearings, 3 Rules Committee hearings, and two Board hearings, not to mention countless staff meetings and outreach meetings, the Board made its final vote on the Cannabis ordinances. This vote not only established the Land Use regulations, but also established the powers of the Office of Cannabis, the various operating requirements for cannabis businesses, and perhaps most significantly the equity program. The Board was working for a unanimous vote; however they only achieved a 10-1 vote with Supervisor Safai voting against the entire proposal.
