Commissioner Richards:
I guess this comes under the column of data is power, I think this is actually, changes the narrative somewhat; I'll leave that up to you. We've been bombarded, bombarded and bombarded, about on how little we're doing to alleviate the housing crisis and how we are not entitling things, and slow we are, and blah, blah, blah. We had a very long presentation by Mr. Switzky on March 2nd, 32 page slide deck on page 27, I'll let you – I am calling some people out specifically in the audience. Out of the existing zoning we can entitle 140,000 units, 140000, that's a hell of lot units. So, the whole narrative that we are out there obstructing, and there is nobody is able to get anything done, the existing zoning without any changes, can solve the housing crisis if people just go and get their land entitled and take advantage of the zoning that they have.I think that’s the real question is: Why is that not happening? Secondly, since 1985 there have been 100,000 units capacity added, through up-zoning. So, this whole notion we’ve down zoned in the 80's and we are now, you know, we are paying for all the stuff again; the narrative is not quite reflecting that. To be fair, I ask staff to go back and actually look what happened in the 60's and 70's as a result that of redevelopment and potentially down zoning in the 70's to get that, I want to correct the record on that. A couple of other things, first this morning, in yesterday’s Business Times, I got an article -- I got a note saying that rent have fallen out 9% in the City, it looks like increased supply has helped out, so people who are supply demand, who say that is a good narrative, looks like some of that burned out. However, in today's Chronicle, it also talked about the net out flow of the population, so demand is going down, probably the best of both worlds, increase supply, decrease demand, prices start falling.So, if you believe and a laws of supply and demand are working, there is good an example of that. One last thing, we talked a lot about evictions and sham evictions, in the paper on Tuesday on the On Guard column one in four no-fault evictions is fraudulent, and I brought this up, over and over, we have no enforcement at the Rent Board, we have a complaint based system that is not working. So, for all the those unit – for all those affordable housing units we're creating, we are actually in the housing balance getting rid of them by evicting people who are paying lower rent and now charging market rate or renting them out on Airbnb and I just think, something need to be done about that.
Commissioner Moore:
The 2000 Census of housing stats for San Francisco stated that, there was a population of – this is 2010 of 850,235 people. The total housing units at that time in 2010 was 376,942. Out of those units, occupied housing units were listed in the 2010 Census as 345,811, and unoccupied housing units at that time were counted as 31,131. I’d like to get an update on the latest census.
Commissioner Richards:
I just want to comment as a follow-up to Commissioner Moore, I know when I first starred on this Commission there was a vacant unit kind of since is done between the Department and SPUR, and think a update refresh on that would be a great good idea.
8.Planning Commission Hearing Start Time
9.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Good afternoon, Commissioners, again, just a thought about the data, that was mentioned, we will see if there is data available the census data, the full census of course is only once per decade, they do something that is called the America Community Survey that relies that looks at, kind of estimates, if you will, of the certain amount data that estimate by the way, the City’s current population is 870,000. I don't know if we have the data on occupied or unoccupied unit because through that, but we can certainly check on that, and I do know the unoccupied units also reflects units that are not – that are being rented, that people have moved out. So, we need to – what is defined as unoccupied, is something we need to look at as well, but we try to get that information for you. That concludes my comments.
10.Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission
Land Use Committee:
·140877 Intercontinental Hotel POPOS In-Lieu Fee.Sponsor: Kim. Staff: Rodgers.
At this week the Land Use and Transportation hearing, the Committee considered Supervisor Kim’s ordinance that would authorize an in lieu fee in exchange for the privately-owned public open space at the Intercontinental Hotel and dedicate that fee to lighting and safety improvements at Victoria Manolo Draves Park.
This commission recommended approval of this ordinance on 11/17/2016. At that time you recommended two changes, which were incorporated into the ordinance by Supervisor Kim. Your requested modifications will accomplish two goals.The first ensures that any impact fees that would be due to the City for the additional FAR as a result of closing the open space will be paid.The second tightens up the findings in the ordinance to avoid setting future precedent for others to fee out of other POPOS requirements.
At this week’s Committee hearing, Supervisor Kim also modified the proposed ordinance to increase the in lieu fee up to $2.6M and to include some funding for future maintenance of the space. The Committee recommended approval of the amended ordinance.
·170139 Hearing Transportation Demand Management Program.Sponsor: Yee, Fewer, Cohen. Staff: Teague.
Last on the agenda was a hearing on the Transportation Demand Management Ordinance, also known as the TDM program. This item was actually passed unanimously by the Board of Supervisors in February and became effective this week. The hearing at the Land Use and Transportation Committee was called by Supervisors Yee and Fewer to discuss details regarding the methodology used to formulate the TDM Menu of Options.
At the hearing there was no public comment. Supervisor Yee had comments regarding point assignment for some measures, including child-friendly housing design, but appreciated ability to update points over time. Supervisor Fewer raised concerns regarding the shuttle bus service measure, and the focus on only vehicle miles traveled reduction, as opposed to other city policy goals. After these comments, the Committee members voted to file the item.
