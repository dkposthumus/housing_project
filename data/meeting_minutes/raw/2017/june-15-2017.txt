This project is seeking development incentives in the form of increased dwelling unit density in exchange for providing a higher level of affordable housing than would otherwise be required pursuant to Planning Code 415 (the Inclusionary Affordable Housing Program) by one of two means: either the application of draft legislation which would amend the Planning Code and Zoning Map of the City and County of San Francisco to establish the Geary-Masonic Special Use District (Board File 161109) or the application of the provisions of the HOME-SF Program. In order to facilitate the project under the HOME-SF Program, Conditional Use Authorization pursuant to Planning Code Section 206.3 is required.The project is also requesting a modification to the rear yard requirements pursuant to Planning Code Section 134, and variances to the usable open space and dwelling unit exposure requirements pursuant to Planning Code Sections 135 and 140 which can be granted as zoning modifications by the Planning Commission pursuant to Planning Code Section 206.Alternatively, these may be granted by the Zoning Administrator pursuant to Planning Code Section 305.This action constitutes the Approval Action for the project for the purposes of CEQA, pursuant to San Francisco Administrative Code Section31.04(h).

Commissioner Moore:
There was an interesting article in yesterday’s paper again. It needs perhaps qualification, but stated that the Uber and Lyft impact on San Francisco traffic is about 15 percent, that would ultimately require further detailed specification, why and how and where, but I thought the number itself was very interesting and quite alarming given that we are still working on the assumption that transit first is the policy by which we plan.
5.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Good afternoon Commissioners, just a couple of announcements today that I want to bring to your attention regarding Connect SF. Connect SF is the transportation vision program that we are managing with our partners at the MTA and the CTA. This is a multi-year effort looking at a 50-year land use transportation vision, I should say for the City, based on land use projections, based on a number of public meetings, and there's a short memo in your packet today about it, but the reason I bring up today first is two fold, one is the first of our task force meetings is next week. It is a very large task force that we've been working very hard on over the last few months to assemble. Commissioner Hillis and Johnson and Richards, excuse me - Commissioner Hillis and Richards are on that task force, and the first of those is next week. There will be a series of public meetings after that the second task force meeting in the fall. It will be - this effort is an important, kind of long term thinking about transportation and it will serve as a kind of guide for many of the other transportation planning efforts, such as the update of the Transportation Element, the Subway Vision, the CTA 2050 Transportation Plan and so on. So, we are excited doing this work. It’s the most involved that the Department have been in transportation for a long time and we believe it is important piece of work for the City to embark on. Secondly, I’d like to introduce you to our new manager of that program Doug Johnson. Doug joined us from many years at the MTC. Doug managed the Plan Bay Area Program for MTC, has a long history with transportation planning in the region and hit the ground running and is doing a great job in getting organized for next week’s task force and as you see Peter Albert is in the audience. Peter held that position for the last few months in transition, and so, we thank Peter again for his many years of service and helping us through this transition. Thanks to Peter and welcome to Doug. That concludes my comments. Thank you.

7.2017-001061PCA-04(J. BINTLIFF: (415) 575-9170)INCLUSIONARY AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAM ORDINANCE–Planning Code Amendmentrevising the Inclusionary Affordable Housing Program. The Planning Commission considered two ordinances on April 27, 2017 [Board File No. 161351 Inclusionary Affordable Housing Fee and Requirements and Board File No. 170208 Inclusionary Affordable Housing Fee and Dwelling Unit Mix Requirements]. Since the Commission hearing, the Board of Supervisors made material modifications which are being referred back to the Commission pursuant to Planning Code Section 302(d).
