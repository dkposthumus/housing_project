This development was previously approved by the Planning Commission in 2012 (Case No. 2011.0744C, Motion No. 18654). The restaurant would utilize the adjacent outdoor seating area/patio (Outdoor Activity Area), measuring approximately 400 square feet, for patrons of the restaurant.

Commissioner Richards:
A couple, several things, first, I had lunch with the Director yesterday and he reminded us, President Hillis and I are about the pipeline and the number of units. Director if you could maybe state publically the numbers that you told us. They were pretty surprising and I was encouraged.
Director Rahaim:
Certainly, currently there are approximately 45,000 units that are fully entitled, that includes the big, what we call the big three projects: Park Merced, the Shipyard and Treasure Island, which are about half of that number. There is about 6,000 under construction, and there is another 3 or 4,000 at DBI for permits, and there are 4 or 5,000 that are kind of, that have had a building permit approved, but have not actually officially started construction.
Commissioner Richards:
Just a statement I’d like to make to the viewing public and to the audience, 45,000 units with about 6,000 started. There are other reasons why things don't get started, such as the building permit issuance, maybe financing, some other issues, so the pipeline is full of entitled units, and they should be coming online, hopefully as fast as they can. So, I want to make sure that everybody is aware of that. Secondly, it has come to our attention, specifically – it has come to my attention, specifically through the press that we have a discretionary review on 100 percent affordable housing that actually came before us as a CU. I recalled that when Supervisor Scott Wiener was trying to exempt 100 percent affordable projects by eliminating the CU, he stated here to us in the room that the neighborhood and the community and the individual people with grievances against the project could file a DR. I never in my mind thought we'd be hearing a CU unit having a DR.I think, I’d to put on our list, we already have it on the action item list, that this Commission look at ways we can try to avert these things, having to come back to us twice when we already looked at as a CU and not a DR. A couple of other things, we talked about the health of the retail environment, we were very much worried about the amount of square footage coming on the market with all the new developments. I was heartened to see from Hoodline that Cole Hardware actually is opening up a store in North Beach. What is that?
Commissioner Hillis:
They already have it.
Commissioner Richards:
They already have opened a store in North Beach. Actually, in the site of we entitled to be the former Mama’s restaurant that had not actually taken flight, so that's a success story, and also, I think, is going to go in Bernal Heights. Retail is not are not quite dead yet. One last thing that will probably come before us that is interesting, in the editorial of the Chronicle, Senator Wiener is proposing having bars to be closed at 4:00 A.M. He is saying local control will dictate whether we want that or not. There is some in the Chronicle came out against it, saying basically San Francisco is not competing with New York, Las Vegas and New Orleans for tourists. People are not coming here because we close our bars at 2:00 A.M. They also talked about having it both ways, that if we’re trying to slow people down and not have them drink so they can get home, if we serve them at 4:00 A.M., that really defeats the whole purpose. So, it is something that we may be hearing here, good article in the Chronicle yesterday. In the future, if this bill were to pass and we were to actually determine whether or not we want to have bars open until 4:00 A.M. Thank you.

E.GENERALPUBLIC COMMENT – 15 MINUTES
At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting.Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
SPEAKERS:Paul Werner – Record requests, digital age, future access
Sue Hestor – Google bus stops, housing for Silicon Valley
Denise Renae – Live nation alcohol use
Georgia Schuttish – 317
However, it would be fairly simple to delete Section 317 (b) (7) in order to preserve housing.If a Project Sponsor wants to reduced the size of a second unit by 20% to 25%, they could simply file a DR.Here is why it should be removed from the Planning Code:
It is illogical in two unit building, particularly in a pair of stacked flats, that one unit can be reduced in size, marginalized and relocated within a structure and thereby create one very large, expanded unit within the same structure that is really remodeled into a single family home.
It is logical that the Planning Commission should use its Discretionary powers to decide if this makes sense on a case by case basis.
Please initiate this change and delete Section 317 (b) (7) from the Planning Code.
