Commissioner Moore:
I'd like to ask the question to get an update, on where we are with permit tracking, a jointeffort between Planning and DBI. Planning was on track, but since this Commission has supported allocation of funds over the years I kind of feel that I'm waiting for it to happen and I was trying to find the permit, obviously I couldn’t and I think that system would be really more coordinated, it will be very easy to get questions to answers that are just not there at the moment.
Director Rahaim:
Commissioners John Rahaim, with the Department, the Department -- the Planning Department went live, I think on October of 2014 and there have been delays on the Department of Building Inspection side. We expect them to – is not total clear at this point, but it likely be another year before they go live. The third component was of course, a public access component, and that really relies on both departments being online. Although, I will say we are looking at options of having some aspects of the public access component before that timeframe. So, I don’t know – I don’t have a good answer for that component, yet, but we -- it does appears to be another year before both departments will be live.
Commissioner Moore:
Could I ask a follow up question, obviously when you integrate systems, your was created with the understanding of the perimeters of the software and software interface, and I understand that there was a breakdown in, I don't want to be too technical, however; does that mean the planning Department retroactively has to invest more money in making this work to make the joint interface?
Director Rahaim:
I don't believe so. There might be a modest amount of resources needs to merge the two systems when they go live, but I don’t think that we will have to retroactively make any changes going forward.
Commissioner Moore:
Because your system works quite well, I use it frequently and I hope that we're not losing anything given that we've made a joint, significant investment in supporting your system.
Director Rahaim:
Okay. Thank you.
Commissioner Richards:
A little levity here, tomorrow I am going to New Zealand, so, you won’t be seeing me next Thursday, however, if I continue to see what I see, every morning in the New York Times, about what is going on in Washington, you may not see me anymore.I'm staying.
8.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Commissioners, I just wanted to review a memo that was in your packet today, with you, to on the implementation update on Proposition 64, which is the Adult Use of Marijuana. After we realized this is information that is relate to a couple of items on your agenda today. But, I just want to go over a high-level what the situation is, with how we’re implementing Prop 64. As you recall, it passed last November but the basis of Prop 64 was that before any business may engage in the sale of adult use cannabis, they must obtain a license and those licenses will not be issued by the State until January of next year, and it doesn't take away -- Prop 64 does not take away any control from the local jurisdiction to regulate at the local level. We anticipate that we will have regulations before you in September of this year, so that we can have them in place when licenses are issued in January. The most, I think, pertinent aspect of all this is whether or not, as you’ve asked us to look into, whether or not if we anticipate that a medical cannabis dispensary which you have approval authority on today could in the future automatically be converted to adult use. While we cannot speak with 100 percent certainty that won’t be the case, it is in our opinion highly, highly unlikely, that local regulations will allow for that. We believe that the adult use cannabis dispensaries would be or sales of any type of will be defined as separate land use in the Planning Code, which will mean that a medical use facility can't be automatically convert because they are two different land uses on our code. In addition to that, if for any reason the regulations don't play out that way, which we think ishighly unlikely, the Board could adopt interim regulations, as they have many for issues in last few years, or you can adopt your own interim controls requiring that the medical use cannabis dispensary is a mandatory discretionary review. So, there are many different options you have to make sure that there is not any kind of automatic conversion, if you will, from a medical cannabis dispensary to adult use sales. I just wanted to give you that information before the hearing today so you have that as background. Thank you.
9.Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission
LAND USE COMMITTEE:
•160925Planning Code - Transportation Demand Management Program Requirement. Sponsor: Cohen. Staff: Schuett.
At this week’s land use hearing, the Committee heard the Transportation Demand Management or TDM Ordinance. Commissions you may recall that you initiated this ordinance and then voted to recommend approval to the Board of Supervisors on August 4, 2016. After transmittal to the Board, Supervisor Cohen took over sponsorship.
This was the third time that the Land Use Committee heard the ordinance. The most significant amendments that passed related to exempting project with 24 or less dwelling units from the ongoing administrative fee and providing for a waiver process for city-funded non-profits from all the administrative fees.
At the land use hearing, Director Rahaim, the chair of MTA Board, and the executive director from the Transportation Authority gave opening remarks about the merits of the new program. Planning staff then made their presentation on the project. Public comment on the proposed ordinance was mainly in support; however, some commenters wish that the project went further by providing more points for reduced parking.
After public comment and some general words of support for the program by the Committee members, Supervisor Sheehy, who was sitting on the Land Use Committee in Scott Weiner’s place, asked to be added as a cosponsor to the ordinance. After the Committee accepted the amendments proposed by Supervisor Cohen they voted to recommend the item to the Full Board.
•170036 Hearing - Cannabis State Legalization Task Force Update. Sponsor: Cohen, Ronen. Staff: Starr/Sider.
Last on the Land Use agenda was a hearing to provide an update on the Cannabis State Legalization Task Force’s recommendations, which were published late last year. Commissioners, you may recall that Supervisor Wiener sponsored the legislation that formed the task force, which began its work early last year. Members of the task force presented their recommendations, which touched on a variety of issues including regulation, taxes, land use and social justice. Public comment was mainly in support of the task force’s work and the normalizing of cannabis in San Francisco; however, there was one commenter who represented a group made up of Chinese Americans that expressed concern over future adult use cannabis activities.
The Committee had few questions for the presenters but did note that the City still had a lot of work to do, not only to create a robust regulator structure for SF, but also to reach out to communities who have concerns over the future of recreational cannabis. Supervisor Sheehy reflected on his days in Act Up and how cannabis helped him cope with the severe side effects of early HIV drugs, which were decidedly more toxic than cannabis. He also commented on how the plant has been unfairly demonized by the US government over the last 40 years. The Committee then voted to continue the item to the call of the chair, allowing the committee to receive future updates.
FULL BOARD:
•161068 Planning Code - Terrace Infill for Noncomplying Structure Designated as a Significant Building in C-3 Zoning District.Sponsor: Peskin. Staff: Starr. PASSED Second Read
•160656 Planning Code – Requiring CU for Medical Services- Sacramento Street Neighborhood Commercial District.Sponsor: Farrell. Staff: Starr. Passed First Read
•161241 Interim Zoning Controls - Indoor Agriculture.Sponsor: Mayor. Staff: Not Staffed. Adoption
Also at the Board was the Mayor’s interim control that would require CU authorization for indoor agriculture. At the hearing Supervisor Peskin, seconded by Supervisor Sheehy, moved that this Resolution be amended to expand the grandfathering provisions to applicants who have 1) applied to the Department of Building Inspection (DBI) for a building permit application or 2) attempted to apply to the Department of Public Health for the building permit and were not referred to DBI until after November 8, 2016. That motion carried. There was an attempt by Supervisor Kim to extend the grandfather date to November 25, but that motion failed. The Board then voted to approve the proposed interim controls.
•161308 General Plan Amendments - Potrero HOPE SF Project.Sponsor: Commission. Staff: Snyder. First Read, Item 26
•161159 Planning Code - Potrero HOPE SF Special Use District.Sponsor: Cohen. Staff: Snyder. Passed First Read
•161160 Planning Code, Zoning Map - Potrero HOPE SF Zoning Map Amendments.Sponsor: Cohen. Staff: Snyder. Passed First Read
•161309 General Plan Amendments - Sunnydale HOPE SF Project.Sponsor: Planning. Staff: Snyder. Passed First Read
•161162 Planning Code - Sunnydale HOPE SF Special Use District.Sponsor: Cohen. Staff: Snyder. Passed First Read
•161163 Planning Code, Zoning Map - Sunnydale HOPE SF Zoning Map Amendments.Sponsor: Cohen. Staff: Snyder. Passed First Read
•161278 Hearing - Appeal of Categorical Exemption from Environmental Review - Proposed Project at 3516-3526 Folsom Street. Staff: Gibson.
Last on the agenda was the Environmental Appeal for 3516 Folsom Street. This project involves the construction of two single-family residences on two vacant lots located on the west side of the unimproved segment of Folsom Street. The Planning Department issued a Class 3 categorical exemption for the project on July 8, 2016. An appeal of the catex was filed in November 2016.
The day of the appeal hearing at the Board, the ERO rescinded the catex, thereby tabling the hearing. At the hearing on the tabling of the appeal, Supervisor Asha Safai was recused. Supervisor Ronen asked Planning staff to explain why the catex was rescinded. The ERO explained that further study was required to address a concern raised by the appellant regarding potential construction-related impacts to the adjacent underground PG&E gas pipeline. Pending the results of the additional analysis, the ERO will determine the appropriate level of environmental review and will issue a new environmental determination. This does mean that the project will require new entitlements.
INTRODUCTIONS:
None
BOARD OF APPEALS:
I'll note the Board of Appeals did meet last night, two items of interest to the Commission. First, the board had their election of officers and the previous officers carried over, so President Honda and Vice President Fung. The other item is 2545 Greenwich Street, which was a discretionary review heard in December of 2015. It was appealed to the Board of Appeals last night, largely concerned about the procedural issues, which I think, they were addressed quite some time ago, and the Board unanimously denied that appeal. No meeting next week, back on February 8th.
HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:
No Report
E.GENERALPUBLIC COMMENT – 15 MINUTES
At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting.Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
SPEAKERS:Andrew Yip – Commonwealth of the Nation
Ozzie Rohm – Documental procedures and policies:
I am here today to once again bring up the issue of documented policies and procedures.
We know the budget will be coming up shortly and we’re hopeful that the Planning Department will attach the dollars it request to concrete goals and commitments like other Department’s do.For instance, Current Planning has never developed comprehensive procedures like it promised to do in the last budget cycle.The result has been new planners who don’t know how to review demo calculations and other quantitative code requirements.We have uneven and inconsistent ways in which projects are reviewed: each one different that the next so that no sponsor or neighbor knows what is going on.
We believe that the budget dollars should be tied to concrete and measurable goals and then those goals need to be met.

10.2011.1356E(M. JACINTO: (415) 575-9033)
CENTRAL SOMA PLAN– Public Hearing on theDraft Environmental Impact Report.The project is a comprehensive plan for the 230-acre, 17-block portion of the city’s South of Market neighborhood bounded by Second Street on the east, Sixth Street on the west, Townsend Street on the south, and an irregular border that generally follows Folsom, Howard and Stevenson Streets to the north. The proposal is the draft Central SoMa Plan, published in August 2016, which seeks to encourage and accommodate housing and employment growth within the Plan Area by:(1)amending existing use districts and planning controls to support mixed-use and office development in portions of the Plan Area where such uses may currently be restricted or not permitted;(2)amending existing height and bulk districts to permit greater heights and densities than currently allowed;(3)modifying street and circulation patterns within and adjacent to the Plan Area; and(4) establishing new, and improving existing, open spaces. The Plan proposes planning policies and controls for land use; urban form (building height, setback and design); functional circulation changes to Folsom, Howard, Harrison, Bryant, Brannan, Third, and Fourth Streets in areas within and beyond the Plan Area; as well as policies and implementation measures related to open space, historical preservation and sustainability. The Plan requires General Plan, Planning Code, and Zoning Map text amendments as well as adoption of a Special Use District (SUD) to permit the Plan’s uses at the locations, heights and intensities proposed.
NOTE:Written comments on the Draft Environmental Impact Report will be accepted at the Planning Department until 5 p.m. on February 13, 2017.
