Commissioner Moore:
I was delighted to read about 2675 Folsom Street and that the appeal was settled prior of being heard as an appeal, many of the issues the community solved with the developer were things that also the commission was also considering. And on a not so happy note, I'm looking to the Director, I heard a building we all have spent a lot of time over the years, 300 Grant is apparently being sold without the plans being pursued.I was not very happy about that because Planning Department and Commission spent huge amount of time crafting and discussing buildings including when it is in a historic district and in this particular case, when the building becomes more of a speculative entitlement flip, it is very difficult without us having any ability to obligate the future owner to really appreciate the work that has already gone into it.
Commissioner Johnson:
Thank you very much, just a quick comment today.I think we have this on our punch list for future working sessions, but I just want to make note, in light of the fact many of our items today are retail oriented, we have a Starbucks that is expanding into a new space, as they are trying a new model that requires a liquor license. We have a Blue Bottle, which is apparently rather controversial and four different Cricket Wireless locations.I just want to reiterate that is really important that the Planning Department and the City begin to get a hold of what is going to be the future of active ground floor use. I think we are still in the world where retail and some personal service are the primary go to for how you activate a ground floor, but I think in a world where people's business model just don't work to fill blocks and blocks with retail commercial activity, we need to be thinking forward to how to make sure that those ground floor uses are activated even if the business models for individual businesses changes and they don't need as much space, they need different kind of spaces.
Commissioner Richards:
In light of Commissioner Moore's comment, I just wanted to remind staff, we’ve been – kind of batting about why buildings have been entitled but not built and I know staff is taking stabs at calling developers and trying to quantify that, I just wanted let the public know we're still trying to get our arms around that to understand why it is buildings are not getting built.
Commissioner Moore:
Without creating a round table discussion on something which is not agendad, I'm looking towards Commissioner Fong and in support from the Small Business Commission to balance new business models together with the aspiration of San Francisco being small business oriented and protecting its own DNA on that subject matter.
Commissioner Richards:
To end I’d like to ask the Chair at some point to consider a joint hearing with the San Francisco Small Business Commission after this is all resolved.
Commissioner Hillis:
Absolutely.
5.Action Item List- Review
SPEAKERS:Sue Hestor – IMP on June 15th
Georgia Schuttish – Action item list date
ACTION:Reviewed and Commented
6.Director’s Announcements
None
7.Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission
Land Use Committee:
·150969 Planning Code - Affordable Housing Bonus Programs. Sponsors: Mayor; Tang. Staff: Rodgers.
First up on the land use agenda was Home SF. Commissioners, you may remember that you acted on this item on February 25, 2016 and recommended approval with modifications.
At the hearing, Supervisor Farrell was absent, so Supervisor Safai was assigned in his place. After Staff’s excellent and thorough presentation, the Committee opened public comment. Those that spoke were overwhelmingly supportive with only a few people voicing objection to the program.
After public comment, Supervisor Tang offered the following amendments:
1.Add a Conditional Use finding around potential impacts to small businesses that might be displaced by a HOME-SF Project. This finding requires a project sponsor to identify whether any displaced business is a legacy business, or a formula retail business.
2.Divorce the percentage of affordable housing and the AMIs of the required affordable units from the pending Inclusionary Ordinance and Section 415. HOME-SF would require 30% on-site affordable units across three tranches of affordability (55-80-110% AMI for rental and 90-120-140% AMI for ownership)
3.Clarify that HOME-SF bedroom requirements would supersede any bedroom/unit mix requirements in other sections of the code; and
4.Remove Fillmore and Divisadero NCT zoning districts from the HOME-SF Program Area.
Following Supervisor Tang’s amendments, Supervisor Peskin requested the following amendments:
1.If a HOME-SF project displaces a non-formula retail space, formula retail shall not be allowed in the replacement project; and
2.Add “density equity” provisions, which limits HOME-SF in the northeast quadrant of the city to soft sites and parcels smaller than 12,500 square feet, and prohibits lot mergers.
Supervisor Tang accepted the formula retail amendment; however, requested that Planning do more analysis on the soft sites amendment, and that this be consider at the full BOS
For his part, Supervisor Peskin believes the following issues are outstanding, and wants to discuss them at full BOS:
1.Requiring 10% 3BRs for the unit mix requirement, similar to Commission’s recent recommendation.
2.Maximum sale price of 20% below market rate for HOME-SF inclusionary units.
Tang’s motion to accept the amendments was taken without objection. Supervisor Peskin then proposed sending item to full Board without recommendation, pending outcomes of “density equity” provisions. This was then taken without objection.
·170208 Planning Code - Inclusionary Affordable Housing Fee and Dwelling Unit Mix Requirements. Sponsors: Safai; Breed and Tang. Staff: Rodgers, Bintliff.Continued to May 15
·170408 General Plan Amendments - 1500 Mission Street Project. Sponsor: Planning Commission. Staff: Sider, Chang. Item 4
·170348 Planning Code, Zoning Map - 1500 Mission Street Special Use District. Sponsor: Mayor. Staff: Sider, Chang. Item 5
Last on the Land Use agenda were the Zoning Map, Planning Code and General Plan Amendments in relation to the 1500 Mission Street also known as the Goodwill Site. This project is site of the proposed 16-story City office building that will house a one-stop permitting center as well as other office functions.  The project will also include a 39-story residential tower with 550 dwelling units, of which 110, or 20%, will be permanently affordable.  To realize the project the site’s existing height and bulk designations had to be modified and a special use district created.  And maps in the General Plan’s Market/Octavia Plan and the Downtown Plan have to also be amended.
Commissioners, you heard theses item on March 23 and voted to recommend approval.
Only one member of the public provided comment; these comments focused on connecting the Van Ness Metro Station to 1 S. Van Ness and the new building so that Muni riders would be able to exit the Van Ness Station and enter either building through a subterranean passage, thereby avoiding exposure to any inclement weather.
Supervisor Tang made a motion to send the item as a committee report to the full BOS.  Supervisor Peskin seconded the motion and that motion passed unanimously, 2-0, with Supervisor Farrell absent.
Full Board:
·160281 Planning Code - Dwelling Unit Mix Requirements.Sponsors: Yee; Farrell. Staff: Starr. PASSED Second Read
·170206 Planning Code - Off-Street Parking and Loading Requirements.Sponsor: Farrell. Staff: D. Sanchez. PASSED Second Read

·170156 Planning Code, Zoning Map – Production, Distribution, and Repair Controls; Eliminating the Transit-Oriented Retail Special Use District, and Correcting Height Limits in the UMU District.Sponsors:  Mayor Lee, Ronen. Staff: Francis. Passed First Read
·170408 General Plan Amendments - 1500 Mission Street Project. Sponsor: Planning Commission. Staff: Sider, Chang. Passed First Read
·170348 Planning Code, Zoning Map - 1500 Mission Street Special Use District.Sponsor: Mayor. Staff: Sider, Chang. Passed First Read
·161146 Hearing – Appeal of Determination of Exemption from Environmental Review – Proposed Project at 2675 Folsom Street.Staff: Kern, Navarrete.
Lastly there was the appeal of the Community Plan Evaluation, for the proposed project at 2675 Folsom Street.  The project includes the demolition of three, two-story warehouse and storage structures and the construction of a four-story residential building, with 117 dwelling units, 17 of which would be affordable. The Planning Commission approved the project on September 22nd of last year with conditions.
This appeal was identical to the 1515 South Van Ness Appeal. Other topics raised by the appellant included inadequate growth projections and analysis in the Eastern Neighborhoods PEIR; that the EN EIR is stale; that the Community Plan Exemption cannot rely upon the EN PEIR due to lack of public benefits provided thus far; that the project doesn’t comply with the General Plan; and that the demo of the buildings could adversely impact the Calle 24 Latino Cultural District.
Since the appeal was filed, this item had been continued 5 times. In the interim, the project sponsors and Calle 24 came to an agreement, and the appeal was withdrawn. Through the agreement, the project sponsor would purchase eight existing offsite units to hand over to a housing nonprofit, and provide 5,200 sf of arts space to a nonprofit at $1.00 per year for 55 years.
As part of this appeal, though, the Board directed Planning Staff to do a Socioeconomic Study for the 2675 Folsom appeal. This study provided a detailed analysis addressing the project’s contribution to gentrification and displacement of residents and local businesses in the Latino Cultural District. Under CEQA, social and economic effects such as gentrification and displacement are not treated as environmental impacts. Socioeconomic effects may be considered under CEQA only to the extent that a link can be established between anticipated socioeconomic effects and adverse physical environmental impacts.
The question at hand was whether gentrification and displacement of existing residents or businesses in the Latino Cultural District can be attributed to market-rate development. Staff’s report concluded that neither the data nor the relevant literature support the claim that market-rate development causes gentrification or displacement. However, even if the project could cause or contribute to gentrification or displacement, these effects would not in and of themselves constitute environmental impacts under CEQA.
At the BOS hearing, Supervisor Ronen moved to table the CPE appeal as it was withdrawn. This passed unanimously.

SPEAKERS:Georgia Schuttish: Pipeline Report Second Quarter 2016
Can we preserve more housing? Would that “create” more middleclass housing for AMIs that are lacking?
Director’s Report May 2017 for Second Quarter 2016:
Moderate Income 80-120% AMI is 16% of Built or Entitled while Above Moderate or >120% is 207.2%
What should be demo’ed?
What should be merged?
What should be altered?
Is there a “right” size unit for any type housing in any Zoned District whether new construction or alteration?
Examples:
130 Randall…demo? alteration? out of character of the neighborhood? could DR been avoided with flexibility by developer and property hit the market sooner and at a lower price? Sold for 3.65 million
55 States Street…entitlement sold iFebruary 2017 for $1.9 million after all t hearings.What was original sales price of demolished house?
376 San Carlos: 4 units originally, now 2 despite Enforcement Action or more? 2 units for sale separately.$$600K+ and $2 million+.
Originally under MOH number? Affordable? Relatively Affordable?
Lynn Rosenzweg – Carl Jensen
On February 9 there was a DR for 3932-3934 26thStreet.You asked for revisions.The next hearing is June 1.The DR requestor would like me there but I cannot attend. I am requesting the hearing be postponed until I am back in the country after August 23.
On February 9 you learned there was a tenant who had lived in 3932 for 63 years.The project sponsor didn’t tell the city this unit was occupied by 93 year old Carl Jensen, and that this was his home.
On February 16, Carl asked for help writing and sending a letter to all of you, setting the record straight about his wish to remain in his home.He wanted to be at the next hearing.
Here is a phot of Carl on feb 13. 2 weeks later, he died.
Had he been with us today he’d have read this letter to all of you.
The Commission Hearing Procedures provide for presentations by staff; followed by the project sponsor team; followed by public comment for and against the proposal.Please be advised that the project sponsor team includes: the sponsor(s) or their designee, lawyers, architects, engineers, expediters, and/or other advisors.
