C.COMMISSION MATTERS
6.Commission Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements.Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Richards:
Interestingly, briefly, today’s Chronicle Page 1- Bay Area Housing Shortage Worsens, it talks about the affordability ratio in the nine counties Bay Areas actually, only second worse to 2005-2006. In San Francisco, medium price of a house is $1.2 million and the affordability ratio is at 12 percent. Imagine, my husband works in non-profit, down payment in a $1.2 million home, would be at least $240K or $120K if you are lucky, to get a carry back mortgage, that is more than he or many of his peers are making in four or five years. So, when we talking about other items today in the agenda and people that are actually in those income ranges, it’s hard for me to understand where they can live, unless they commute very, very long distances to work in the City.

H.PUBLIC COMMENT
At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.In response to public comment, the commission is limited to:
(1)responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or
(2)requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or
(3)directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.(Government Code Section 54954.2(a))
