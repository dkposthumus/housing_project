SPEAKERS:None
ACTION:Adopted
AYES:Hillis, Fong, Koppel, Melgar
ABSENT:Johnson, Moore, Richards
Commissioner Melgar:
Thank you. I read in the paper that the developer has submitted plans for the buildingon 16th and Mission Street. I just want note that the community has been here numerous times during public comment requesting for a hearing to be held in the community because it's such a large project. I know that some of my fellow Commissioners, you know, sort of feel one way or the other, but I would like to know from staff whether we have entertained the request, whether it's possible and to do a public report about it because the community has been here numerous times. Thank you.
Commissioner Hillis:
Do you want to quickly respond to that?
Director Rahaim:
Thank you, Commissioner. I think, I just had a conversation with the community just a couple of hours about it. I think there are two parts of the question. One is whether the commission would entertain having a hearing in the neighborhood. And I think the answer is that you’re -- that the Commission is open to it. The reason that we haven't taken it a step farther than that is we simply don't know when that might be yet because the project is a little bit on hold. So, I think the most important question, though, is if the Commission is willing to have a hearing in the neighborhood, I – we will formally respond to the neighborhood and say, yes, we will schedule such a hearing when and if it makes – when it makes sense for the project.
Commissioner Hillis:
Again, I think it could be, if there's any -- you know, there's a chance that there is an EIR.
Director Rahaim:
Right.
Commissioner Hillis:
That needs to be done. So there could be a draft EIR hearing, it could be the final approval, consideration of the project and there could be a general public hearing on it. But I think we've all kind of expressed a willingness to have that meeting. Just kind of figuring out when and what meeting and timing comes along.
Director Rahaim:
I will let the community know that. Thank you.
Commissioner Melgar:
Thank you, Director.
4.Director’s Announcements

5.Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission
Land Use Committee:
·170930 General Plan - Pier 70 Mixed-Use District Project. Sponsor: Commission. Staff: Sucre.
·170864 Planning Code, Zoning Map - Pier 70 Special Use District. Sponsors: Mayor; Cohen. Staff: Sucre.
·170987 Public Trust Exchange Agreement - California State Lands Commission - Pier 70 Project. Sponsors: Mayor; Cohen. Staff: Not Staffed.
First on the agenda was the Pier 70 project. Due to the pending environmental appeal, the Project was referred to the Full Board with no recommendation as a committee report. After the Appeal, which was scheduled for this week and ultimately withdrawn, the Land Use Committee will once again review the Ordinance and the subsequent amendment on October 30th. The Full Board will then hear the project on October 31st.
·170961 Hearing - Proposed Central SoMa Plan. Sponsor: Kim. Staff: Wertheim.
Next on the Land Use agenda was a hearing on the Central SoMa Plan, the first in what is expected to be a series of hearing on this item. Director Rahaim along with Steve Wertheim and Josh Switzky from Planning Staff were in attendance. They presented overview of the plan and a summary of the strategy for building new housing within the plan area and a discussion on the jobs housing relationship. About 20 people participated in public comment, some speakers spoke to the overall project while others focused on more specific concerns such as the flower mart and affordable housing in the plan area.
Supervisor Kim had several questions about the affordable housing strategy. Supervisor Peskin had questions about the specific numbers cited in the presentation, and if we were getting the jobs-housing numbers right. As this was an informational hearing there was no action by the Committee. The item was continued to the call of the chair, and it’s anticipated that the next hearing will be before the end of the year.
·170923 Planning Code - Landmark Designation of 1399 McAllister Street (aka Third Baptist Church Complex. Sponsor: Breed. Staff: D. Smith.
Last on the Land Use agenda was the landmark designation for the Third Baptist Church Complex located at 1399 McAllister Street in the Western Addition. The complex is historically significant for its associations with the social, economic, and political advancement of African Americans in San Francisco and for its association with civil rights leader, Reverend Frederick Douglas Haynes. It’s also a rare and notable example of Midcentury Modern ecclesiastical architecture in San Francisco. The Historic Preservation Commission voted unanimously to recommend this as a landmark on August 16, 2017
At the land use committee, Reverend Amos C. Brown, the current pastor of Third Baptist Church, spoke in support of the landmark designation, as did several members of the Third Baptist Church congregation
Both Supervisor Peskin and Farrell signed on as co-sponsors of the legislation. Supervisor Peskin then moved to forward the item to the full board, which passed unanimously.

Small Business Commission
Also this week Planning Staff along with the Director of the Office of Cannabis presented the proposed Cannabis Regulations to the Small Business Commission.
