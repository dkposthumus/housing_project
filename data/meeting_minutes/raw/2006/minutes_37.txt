Specifically, the Commission will consider the following items and may take action on or after January 18, 2007:
Â·Ã°Case 2003.0347M -a proposedGeneral Plan amendmentthat would add a new area plan, the Market and Octavia Area Plan, and make related amendments to the Commerce and Industry, Housing, Recreation and Open Space and Transportation Elements, the Civic Center Area Plan, Downtown Area Plan, South of Market Area Plan and the Land Use Index;
Â·Ã°Case 2003.0347T -a proposedPlanning Code text amendmentthat would revise Planning Code controls, including controls for land use, height and bulk, building design, loading, parking and establish new fees;
Â·Ã°Case 2003.0347Z -a proposedZoning Map amendmentthat would revise Maps 2 and 2H, 7 and 7H, and 2SU and 7SU.The proposed Planning Code text and map (Zoning Map) amendments would a) establish three new zoning districts, b) amend the Hayes-Gough, Upper Market, and Valencia Neighborhood Commercial Districts (NCDs), c) update height and bulk districts, d) establish the Market and Octavia Community Improvements Impact Fee, and e) make related revisions necessary to implement the General Plan.The proposed changes are described in greater detail in Case 2003.0347T (above).
Together, these Commission actions are intended to implement the Market and Octavia Plan.In addition, an historic survey is currently being done of the project area; property owners considering constructingor altering a building in this area should consult with Planning Department staff to determinethe historic resource status of their property.Property owners and interested parties are advised that height limits and other controls do not provide unqualified rights to development, but rather, proscribe the maximum potential building envelope that may be permitted; proposed buildings may not reach the maximum permitted building height/envelope.The Commission may also consider establishing interim procedures to guide the review of plans to construct new structures and alter existing structures toprotectpotentially eligible historic resources in the Plan Area prior to conclusion of an historic resources survey.
Members of the public may review a copy of the proposed amendments at the San Francisco Planning Department office at 1660 Mission Street 5th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94103, at the Public Library (the Main Library 100 Larkin St., and Harvey Milk branch library, 1 Jose Sarria Ct. (near16th & Market Sts.).An electronic copy of the proposed amendments and actions is available athttp://marketoctavia.betterneighborhoods.org.
As part ofCase No. 2003.0347T, the proposed Planning Code text amendment would revise Planning Code controls, including controls for land use, height and bulk, building design, loading, parking and establish new fees.The proposed amendments are described more fully below:
Establishment of Three Zoning Districts in the Plan Area
TheTransit-Oriented Residential Use District(RTO)will replace most of the RH and RM districts zoning north and south of the Market Street corridor, extending north to Turk Street, west to Noe and Scott Streets, and South to Sixteenth Street. The proposed RTO district will encourage moderate-density, multi-family, and residential infill. Because of the availability of transit service, proximity of retail and services within walking distance, and limitation on permitted parking the RTO permits the construction of some housing without accessory parking. Parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing within buildings in keeping with neighborhood scale. Proposed heights inResidential Transit Oriented (RTO)Districts and RH districts primarily remain 40 and 50 feet as currently classified; in someRTOareas, permitted heights will change from 50, 80 and 105 feet to 40 and 50 feet.
ANeighborhood Commercial Transit District (NCT)willoverlay the Hayes-Gough Neighborhood Commercial District and portions of the Upper Market and Valencia Neighborhood Commercial Districts within the Market and Octavia neighborhood.Innamed NCT and NC-1 (T) districts, parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing above ground-floor retail uses. These districts will largely keep the existing specific use-size controls. They include current Neighborhood Commercial Districts (Hayes-Gough, portions of the Upper Market, Valencia) and several parcels currently zoned NC-1.
TheVan Ness and Market Downtown Residential Special Use District (VNMDR-SUD)will permit the development of a transit-oriented, high-density, mixed-use neighborhood around the intersections of Van Ness Avenue and Market Street and South Van Ness Avenue and Mission Street.This SUD will overlay existing C-3-G districts and existing C-M districts will be rezoned to C-3-G with this new VNMDR-SUD. Parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing in buildings with mixed-used podiums and some residential towers at two key intersections: Market Street and Van Ness Avenue and Mission Street and South Van Ness Avenue. Proposed heights in theVan Ness and Market Downtown Residential Use District (VNMDR-SUD)will change from 120, 130, 150, 160, 200 and 320 feet to 85, 120, 200, 320 and 400 feet; towers will be permitted over a podium of 85 or 120 feet; the highest towers will be permitted in the vicinity of the Market Street/Van Ness Avenue intersections.
In theTransit-Oriented Neighborhood Commercial Use Districts (NCT),height districts will change from 50, 80 and 105 feet to primarily 55, 65 and 85 feet; these districts will be located in SoMa West and along Market Street. The NCT district will largely replace C-M and NC-3 districts. In theNCT district, parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing above ground-floor retail uses. These districts will largely keep the existing specific use-size controls in place in the NC-3 district.

Establishment of New Fees in the Plan Area
In order to fund the community improvements identified in the Plan, the Program document proposes to establish aDevelopment Impact Fee, requiring the growth that generates the demand for additional infrastructure and services to provide some of the revenue required to fund the improvements.The proposal establishes a development impact fee on new residential and commercial development in the Plan Area.The fee proposal is $10.00 per square foot of residential development, and $4.00 per square foot of commercial development.
To encourage the provision of necessary and desirable public infrastructure improvements and also in order to mitigate the impacts of this increased localized density, the Department has established theVan Ness and Market Neighborhood Infrastructure Fund. Developers may provide in-kind public improvements (such as open space or streetscape improvements) or proportional in-lieu contributions to this fund that will allow the city to develop these facilities. The Department estimates that no more than 6 potential development sites would benefit from participating in the program. The Department has set the value of the additional FAR at par with the current market value of historic TDR credits ($15 per square foot).
