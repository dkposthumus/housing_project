Zoning Administrator Badiner:I would like to read a statement from Director Macris who is out of town.Sue's passion for San Francisco was remarkable.She treated all citizens fairly regardless of circumstances or status.What set her apart was not her general regard for people as individuals.In every San Francisco person she found joy everywhere.She was the best of America.San Francisco was privileged to have Sue as a citizen and an advocate for these many years.There are a number of members of staff who are here also in recognition of Sue.
With that, we ask that we have a moment of silence in her honor.
Thank you.

333 Fremont Street-Motion to Approve In-Kind Agreement to Satisfy Rincon Hill Community Infrastructure Impact Fee Requirement per Section 318.3(e).The Planning Commission approved a project at 333 Fremont Street on June 16, 2005, that includes approximately 88 dwelling units. Planning Code Section 318.3(b)(i) requires payment of $11.00 per net occupied square foot of residential development for the Rincon Hill Community Infrastructure Fund prior to issuance of site permit. The project required a payment of approximately $769,142. On March 14, 2006, the project sponsor deposited the full amount of its required fee, plus interest, into an escrow account payable to the City, pending approval of an In-Kind Agreement that would credit the sponsor for a portion of the fee in exchange for publicly accessible improvements in accordance with the Rincon Hill Plan. The project sponsor has entered into an In-Kind Agreement with the City, to the satisfaction of the Planning Department and City Attorney, to construct, and dedicate a permanent public easement on, a mid-block pedestrian pathway on the project site. The Planning Department recommends a fee credit equal to construction cost of the pathway improvements (approximately $240,000) plus the value of the public easement ($333,000), or approximately $573,000 total. The City would thus draw from the escrow account the difference of the full fee and this credit, or $196,142, and deposit this amount in the SOMA Stabilization Fund as part of the required transfer of up to $6 million from the Rincon Hill Infrastructure Fund to the SOMA Stabilization Fund per Section 318.6(b)(2).
