- My family has lived in San Francisco 12 years at Kirkham Street.
- We have never been in trouble with the law.
- I don't think I'm going to be spider man and climb on someone's building.
- Land is precious in San Francisco.Houses are built right up next to each other.
- We're pretty lucky we have a four-foot separation between our houses.
- In terms of light and air:When Ms. Chan built her big three-story house, she used every inch that's buildable on her property.Maybe she should have thought about air and light in the beginning.
- I'd like you to know that our building is designed to be built for light and air for my family so we can enjoy our backyard also.
