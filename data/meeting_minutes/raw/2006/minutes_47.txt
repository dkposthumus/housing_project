ACTION:Informational only.Although no action was required of the Commission, through discussion commissioners instructed the Zoning Administrator to make a recommendation or speak at the Board of Appeals to recommend that the permit be revoked now.In complying, the Zoning Administrator said he would also inform the appellants that they have a right to put a block book notation on any permits [for this project site] so they get notified of any permit that comes in.This allows them to request Discretionary Review or draw it to our attention.And going further still, the Zoning Administrator assured the Commission that any elimination of dwelling units, dwelling unit mergers, or even reconfiguration of units would be brought before the Commission for review.
