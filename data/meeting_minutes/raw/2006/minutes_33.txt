Consideration of an Ordinance amending the Planning Code in order to allow certain nonconforming uses to seek  CafÃ© Tables and Chairs' permits. The proposed Ordinance would amend Planning Code Article 1.8 in order to allow [1] LCU's (Limited Commercial Uses) and [2] certain NCU's (nonconforming uses) to seek permits which could authorize them to place tables and chairs on public sidewalks. Presently, the Planning Code subjects these uses to restrictions and prohibitions. The proposal would not affect existing Municipal Code provisions relating to the Department of Public Works' (DPW) ability to evaluate and issue annual  CafÃ© Tables and Chairs' permits when certain accessibility criteria are met and when a public notification process has been completed. These provisions allow any such permit to be the subject of a DPW public hearing, the outcome of which may be appealed to the Board of Appeals. The proposed Ordinance was introduced by Supervisor Mirkarimi, as part of Board of Supervisors File Number 061069.
