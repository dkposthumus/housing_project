B.COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
9.Commission Comments/Questions
-I want to take this opportunity since I was away last week, to thank Kevin Hughes who will not return to the commission and not seek re-appointment.

-If there was ever a difficult situation that needed a solution, we could count on Kevin to do it.
-It was a solution that would be approved.
-I've put together solutions but Kevin would put it together and people would approve it.
-I want to thank you for your service over the years.
-I'm going to miss you.

-Last week we had an interesting situation about the tall towers being in New York and Philadelphia – people see it's something that is being done.
-I don't know if others are seeing, but we are seeing a resurgence of commercial establishments in big cities after [they] moved to suburban areas.
-They are realizing a lot of the population wants to live in urban areas.
-I'm impressed with Philadelphia.
-I was there in 2000 and there has been a huge improvement.
-Two matters I think is good news:
-I wanted to announce that the Cal women's crew team won the National Championship.
-The good part about that is 10 of the girls, among the 16 teams, were from San Francisco.
-And that is the highest of any city in the world.
-These teams have as part of their teams, girls from Australia, Europe and the United States.
-It must be the training on Lake Merced.
-As you are in New York and other cities, even though we don't have as many Fortune 500 companies, ours are visible.
-There are new ones that established their presence in those areas.
-I think that speaks well of some of our companies' back there and the fact that our presence is felt throughout the world.
