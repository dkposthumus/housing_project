B.COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
6.Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Antonini
Commissioner Moore
-I would like to bring to the attention of the Commission a wonderful article about Back to Reality.It was in the papers last Friday.
-I am looking forward the Planning Department, who has already made strives in revitalizing alleys as new downtown centers for entertainment, restaurants, and civic life to really take the opportunity at every possibility.

7.Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
Dan Sider
Board of Supervisors
Land Use and Economic Development Committee
Mr. Badiner, Zoning Administrator
Board of Appeals
A-704 North Point – Medical Cannabis Dispensary – Discretionary Review.Commission decision wasupheld.
SPEAKERS
Marilyn Amini
-I am going to comment about the motion introduced by Supervisor Peskin.
-That motion would do nothing for you to ensure that significant matters come before you.
-There are already rules that require a 30-day hold on significant policy matters.It's Rule 5.0
-The community improvements in the Eastern Neighborhoods legislation that the Commission asked for formally with a letter to come back before you for your review and comment was put on a 30 day hold.That is not the problem.

2005 HOUSING INVENTORY REPORT– Announcing the publication of the2005 Housing Inventory.This report is the 36th in the series and describes San Francisco's housing supply.Housing Inventorydata accounts for new housing construction, demolitions, and alterations in a consistent format for analysis of housing production trends.Net housing unit gains are reported citywide, by zoning classification, and by planning district.Other areas covered include affordable housing, condominium conversions, and residential hotel stock.In addition, lists of major housing projects in the pipeline (i.e, projects under review by the Planning Department and the Department of Building Inspection, and projects authorized for construction) are included to provide a picture of likely housing construction activity in the near future.Report is available for the public at the Planning Department and on the website.
Preliminary Recommendation: No Action required. Informational only.
SPEAKERS
Sue Hestor
-I have raise questions about the housing inventory for many years.Once again, there is a big problem with the data.
-If you compare page 39 to page 37, projects authorized for constructions versus projects pending, you will find 601 Alabama on both lists.
-On page 37, I also note that there is a project authorized for construction at 1179 Tennessee Street.That is one of the messiest cases at the Planning Department.
-I would really love it if one of the staff hired would be a really data expert to keep track of projects.
-There is a major disfunction between the housing prices and the median sales price.It should be flagged to show whom are we building houses for.
ACTION:Meeting held – Informational only – no action required
9.(L BADINER/S. WEIRTHEIM: (415) 558-6350/558-6612)

D.GENERALPUBLIC COMMENT – 15 MINUTES

SPEAKERS
Emeric Kalman
-I want to raise a very important issue for the City that might be an inconvenient question for you, and ask staff to respond.
-We do need more housing and there is no question about it, but does the City have the proper capacity for energy, water and sewer?
-This waster plan was reported to take 4 or 5 years and it is not ready.
-We would be in a real problem in case of an emergency because we do not have answers.
Guadalupe Arriola, Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition
-Asked the Commission to take into account the low income San Francisco working families for affordable family housing.
-The permanent controls are opportunities to create these policies that will prioritize community services for the most vulnerable in San Francisco.
Sue Hestor
-I got a lot of 311 notices and received one two days ago for a proposal to legalize an already done construction.
-The question is why we are putting the burden on people to file for a DR [Discretionary Review] and pay $400 to reward someone who is acting illegally?
-The second thing is the failure to follow up on the historic district.
-There should be a search of the computer files to find out files/project pending in historic areas and warn them to comply in accord to historic districts and the Landmark Board.
-We are spending a lot of time correcting something that should have never happened and how do we correct those mistakes?
-The project on Tennessee Street went to the DBI and the Board of Appeals but did not come to you.That is questionable to me.
Marilyn Amini
-When you initiated the Market-Octavia hearings, you decided to frame your hearings on topics versus the community needs framework.I hope the public would be allowed to speak on that plan even if it is not scheduled.
-[Reminded the Commission about Sunshine requirements Section 67(d) regarding public comments.]
-Sunshine supersedes any other City ordinances.

SPEAKERS ON THE CONSIDERATION FOR CONTINUANCE
Marilyn Amini
Hiroshi Fukuda
SPEAKERS:
Marilyn Amini
-I hope the public would be allowed to speak at the time the item is called.
-This says that the Commission took action to close public comments.However, that is not the case because I have the transcript of it and it was just continued.
-Chapter 31 of the Administrative Code states that no amendment can be made to this code without a 30-day notice.
-You have to develop a recommendation based on public hearing and your recommendation should be final.
-Public hearing should not be closed for item 10 because you did not take action on it.
Steve Williams
-I had asked several questions to some of the staff and I have not gotten any answer making much sense to me.
-On Page 7 of the proposed amendments, it basically says that all Categorical Exemption that has anything to do with historic resources and districts require an additional step for some kind of objections to this body.
-You were told last time that your calendar would not be increased and I see here a great potential for increasing your calendar.
-In order to appeal a Cat. Ex., you will have to be entitled of intent to rely the issue.I have no idea what that is and I asked staff and they do not know what it is either.
-The ordinance as it is proposed does not make any sense.That section needs to be straightened.
Sue Hestor
-The section on the Cat. Ex. is extraordinarily confusing.I proposed a simple solution: diagram it.
-It needs to be clear.What is the notice of intent to approve?
-Secondarily, it was the practice of the Commission for years that any changes need to be presented
-What is the briefing for the Board of Supervisors?
-It is really hard to understand.There are many things and many solutions.
