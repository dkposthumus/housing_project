C.COMMISSIONERSâ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
7.         Commission Comments/Questions
Inquiries/Announcements.  Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
Future Meetings/Agendas.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Antonini:
I had the pleasure of meeting with an architectural firm yesterday, the biggest designer of football stadiums throughout the United States and the world.  They are doing one in Liverpool, England.  They are favorably impressed with our site at Bayview Hunters Point.  They are going to comment on that to us in the future.  That was good to hear.  It was a very good meeting.
I also want to raise another issue because I was a little concerned.  There was an article in the Chronicle today about the shadow legislation that might change the way that shadowing is considered.  There a couple of things about this.  The first is that it seems to take away any small amounts of discretion that may exist.  And second, apparently, I havenât read the details of the legislation, it moves jurisdiction out of the Planning Commission, away from Park and Rec, and ultimately to the Board of Supervisors.  I think we have done a pretty darn good job of looking at these issues when they come up and have been very careful about granting it.  There was one in particular â Boniker Park â where you had to weigh the shadow against the good it was doing.  There are a lot of things like that.  Iâd like to ask staff, if possible to analyze this measure and give us some input as to the affects that it might have if the other commissioners so agree, so we can be knowledgeable about what purportedly is some very negative affects on any future development that may occur.  That is certainly not something we want to happen.
Finally, Iâve been in touch with Doug Shoemaker abut some issues that were surrounding affordable housing and about our ability to take care of people who are presently homeless.  I havenât got an answer on that yet and I think that this would be better brought up during our discussion on the Housing Element, which is coming up in the future.
Commissioner Lee:
Last week we had a hearing regarding the proposed Stimulus Plan.  Yesterday, the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) forecast for the Bay Area that we are losing another 20,000 jobs in 2010; but that we should have some growth in 2011.  What really hit me the most was that our growth is predicated on building housing.  Last week when Ted Egan was here I brought up the issue about the trades in San Francisco and I mentioned we have 30% unemployment.  But Ted Egan thought it was higher than that.  So if you assume that ABAG is correct, and the city doesnât start moving with about 11,000 housing units that have been approved and start building, we will have difficulty not only this year, but also next year.  What bothers me the most is that losing another 20,000 jobs in the Bay Area is really going to hurt the average middle class and even the lower class people here.  This past week I had a discussion with Tom Radulovich about what we can do to stimulate jobs.  We both came to the conclusion that we have a lot of illegal units (in-law units) in the city.  And one possible proposal would be to legalize those units which would benefit the cityâs tax base, but it would also benefit where some of the structures that are considered illegal in-laws donât meet building codes.  After what happened in Haiti, I would just like to see this as a proposal put forward by the Planning Commission or the Board or the Mayorâs Office.
Commissioner Olague:
Can we initiate legislation?  Or is it something the Board does?
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
Commissioner, yes, you can initiate legislation.
Commissioner Olague:
There is one question I have and the response can be in the form of a memo.  Jan Gehl was here last year and did a lot of work.  I was wondering, will there be any outcome from his recommendations, or are we going to implement anything?
Director Rahaim:
Weâll get you a memo.  We are finalizing the Fishermanâs Wharf report and recommendations right now.
Commissioner Sugaya:
I too read the article in the paper that Commissioner Antonini was referring to.  I was reminded that when Craig Nikitas was here talking about some adjustment to the way shadows would be analyzed and calculated, I made a comment that perhaps we should look at no shadowing in certain parks.  I guess Supervisor Chiu was either listening in or watched the tape on SFGTV.  I think the article was rather alarmist and I think certain statements in there could have been more objectively presented.  Iâm glad that Commissioner Antonini asked for some evaluations.  For example, the shadowing of Union Square potentially by the Transbay Terminal Tower may be true at the heights that itâs at but it is certainly not the case if it were lowered.  That is the kind of thing that Iâd be looking for also.
Commissioner Miguel:
I also read that article also and look forward to more information regarding it.
I have asked the Secretary that we close the meeting this evening in memory of Norm Rolfe, who most of us know.  He passed away on the 15that 84 years old.  There will be a memorial for him on the 19thof February, 7 to 9:30 p.m. at the San Francisco Cable Care Museum.
In addition to that, my wife and I had an interesting event this weekend in conjunction with fundraising for the (totally) rebuilt Potrero Library.  They did a home and houseboat tour â an interesting combination that doesnât occur too many other places in the country probably.  What was most interesting was the selection of the eight homes as well as the four houseboats.  The eight homes covered everything from two earthquake shakes that had been put together; another earthquake shake that was on a second piece of property; to a recently completed four-level ultra-modern high-end building; all in Potrero Hill; and two restorations of more historic structures.  It showed the eclectic nature of many San Francisco neighborhoods.  It was very well received.  The houseboats along Mission Creek are a wonderful little community.  It was a great community effort down there for the park they put together.  If any of you get a chance to get down there, it is very interesting.
I also met with people regarding changes that will be coming before us regarding the Gift Center.
The Mayor called a meeting of the Presidents of all commissions (mandatory) just the other day regarding the budget situation â $522.2 million in shortfall.  There is only 1.2 billion of our 6.2 billion city budget that is discretionary so you canât look at it against the six; you have to look at it against the one.  There were no conclusions obviously, but it was the usual type of meeting to make sure everyone was on board and getting their budget projections together.  They did it last year as well.
I attended a Discretionary Review Reform meeting at Planning.  It was not usually attended, but I thought there was an interesting mix of neighborhood representatives, of architects, and of home owners.  It was a pretty good discussion.  There will be more of those coming up next week for both the commissioners and the public if you have the ability and time to attend.  I like that type of meeting.  When people come before us, we hear their three minutes or less testimony, but when you are in meetings like that you hear the questions that are raised that really inform you much more than the short testimony before the Commission.
Commissioner Antonini:
Iâm not sure if we can adjourn in memory of two people or not, but I do want to mention that Tom Hayes passed away.  He was the father of Joanne Hayes-White.  The Rosary is tonight and I think the funeral mass is tomorrow morning.  He was a wonderful gentleman and I had occasion to know him for many years.
8.         Directorâs Announcements
Director Rahaim:
As you can imagine, we have been asked by several Board members as well as commissioners to do analysis of the proposed ballot measure.  We will be doing an analysis to specifically look at impacts on some of the projects involving taller buildings.  And specifically on Transbay we are trying to determine what height of buildings would be possible with having no impact on shadow.  Itâs kind of a judgment call, but we think we can get close.
I want to mention a new effort that we are starting this year related to that part of Eastern Neighborhoods that was changed â the old SLI District.  If you recall, when you approved that Plan, we agreed that we should take another look at that district, essentially along the 4thand 5thStreet corridors where the new Central Subway will be going.  The Department is undertaking an effort that will first do several months worth of work looking at job growth and potential growth areas in the city based on a number of things.  The recent ABAG projections are projecting a much higher job growth for the city than they had before â specifically a growth of 240,000 jobs by 2035.  That is a substantial increase.  It is not clear to me how we would accommodate that much; but nonetheless, we are obligated to take a look at where it would go and how it would go.  In addition, the Central Subway is going in there and we had previously agreed and the Commission had asked us to take a look at that area.  In addition, there is the Western SOMA Plan underway and TODCO is undergoing a six-month community charrette with one of the universities â Cal Polly.  They will be looking at that corridor over the next few months and they have asked for us to present some of our work which we are just getting started.  Sarah Dennis will be heading up this effort and she will start by looking at the job growth that is projected for the city; where it might grow; and what this corridor could accommodate in terms of jobs and housing and some combination thereof.  We will be going to the first of TODCOâs meetings next week to talk about this effort.  Then we will be coming to you with the overall scope and ideas for the study in the next few weeks.
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
Commissioners, just a couple of items:  In next weekâs packets there is a response to a request from Commissioner Olague regarding 199 Leland Avenue, the Senior Housing.  She had a concern with the on-going monitoring to make sure it was occupied correctly.  We do believe it is being occupied by seniors.  Weâve done a survey; weâve talked to the managers; and there is a one-page memo on that.  The other is also a memo regarding 279 Monterey Blvd. which is a demolition of a building.  When you approved Sec 317 and the amendments thereto almost a year and a half ago I think, there was allowed an Administrative approval for single-family dwellings that met certain criteria.  We havenât had many of them.  I think this is the first one.  We committed to you that when we approved them administratively, we would let you know.  So there is a memo on that.  I donât think there is any doubt about this building.  Staff went out there and looked at it.  It is not in great shape, but it is an Administrative Approval and I thought it behooved me to let you know.  So those two memos are in your next weekâs packets.
9.         Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS
Land Use Committee:
Interim Controls related to the Inclusionary Housing Requirements âThis resolution was introduced by the Mayor and Board President Chiu in light of the recent court decision âPalmer/6thST Properties vs. City of Los Angeles.â  The interim controls would ensure that projects currently moving through the entitlement process will conform to the requirements of the draft permanent controls in that it would modify Section 315 to a fee-based Affordable Housing Program requiring all projects to pay an affordable housing fee to the Mayorâs Office of Housing.Due to noticing requirements, this item was continued two weeks.
Budget & Finance Committee:
Mills Act Historical Property Contract for 166-178 Townsend Street âThe building is a contributing structure within the South End Historic District.  The project consists of a six-story addition with 94 rental units, 45 parking spaces, and the rehabilitation of the historic facades.  The project received a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Historic Preservation Commission (HPC) on September 2, 2009, a Conditional use authorization from the Planning Commission and a variance from the Zoning Administrator on September 3, 2009.  The Mills Act Historical Property Contract was reviewed by the HPC on December 16, 2009.  At that hearing, the HPC recommended approval of the contract to the Board of Supervisors on a c to 1 vote.  At the Board Committee hearing this week, the Committee questioned the project sponsor about the back taxes owed ($100K+), and the valuation of the building â specifically whether it should be based on the existing unimproved value of the building or the improved, built-out value of the building.The Committee continued the item two weeks to gather more data.
Full Board of Supervisors:
A resolution for adoption with Committee reference âThis resolution is regarding opposing changes to the Park Shadow Ban that would increase shading of public parks.  This would be a non-binding resolution of statement.  At this hearing, Supervisor Elsbernd requested that the item be referred to a committee.No vote was taken at the Full Board and it will be heard at a later date.
Introductions:
100103 âMayor Newsom introduced an ordinance amending the San Francisco Health Code by amending Section 1009.53 and by adding Article 19L, Sections 1010.5 through 1010.11, to prohibit the sale of tobacco within 1,000 feet of any public or private school.
100102 âMayor Newsom and Supervisor Maxwell introduced an ordinance that amend the Public Works Code that would require the development and maintenance of storm water management controls for specified activities that disturb 5,000 square feet or more of the ground surface and are subject to building, planning and subdivision approvals.
100092 âSupervisor Sophie Maxwell introduced a hearing request on the Hunters Point Shipyard Phase 2 and Candlestick Point Integrated Development Project including a discussion of the land use and design, housing, community benefits, employment and contracting, open space, sustainability, financing, infrastructure, and transportation components of the plan.
BOARD OF APPEALS:

SPEAKERS:
Marc Salomon
Re:       Stimulus Development Streamlining Bill.  What we are getting are full projects that need full infrastructure paying partial fees.  This means that the money to pay for that infrastructure has got to come from somewhere else.
Isabel Wade
Re:       Open Space â Iâm concerned that we are not getting the kind of open space out of the development process that we need in our city.  I am hoping that we might exact some fees up front that go for real parks.
Joe Boss
Re:       Budget â Between the potential of the Stimulus package which would defer payments of fees and the fact that the Citizen Advisory Committees for Eastern Neighborhoods and Market Octavia are finally seated and starting to do things and they are staffed currently by the Planning Department, but I saw nothing in the budget that reflects that.  I want to make sure they continue to be staffed even though the money is not coming in.

SEISMIC UPGRADE OF BAY DIVISION PIPELINES NOS. 3 and 4 AT THE HAYWARD FAULT  PROJECT-Public Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Report -The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) is proposing the Seismic Upgrade of Bay Division Pipelines Nos. 3 and 4 at the Hayward Fault Project. The project seeks to improve seismic and delivery reliability of the pipelines where three fault traces of the Hayward fault bisect the pipelines near the intersection of I-680 and Mission Boulevard in the City of Fremont. The Project would be located on City and County of San Francisco (CCSFTC "City and County of San Francisco (CCSF" \f A \l "1" ) owned right-of-way (ROW). The total proposed project area (including all construction, staging, and access areas) covers approximately 29 acres.  The primary components of the proposed project would include:
The installation of a 78-inch welded steel pipeline (BDPL3x) that runs adjacent to BDPL 3 and 4 for approximately 2, 360 feet, that would include project design improvements at the three fault traces.  A 400-foot articulated underground vault would be constructed at Trace B, designed to prevent rupture of the new BDPL3x.
A design upgrade of BDPL 4 to strengthen the pipeline at the fault trace B and C, and to direct leakage after a seismic event to the local storm drain system, and to prevent additional damage to the new BDPL3x pipeline.
Abandonment of BDPL3, with design changes to the abandoned pipeline to direct water to the local storm drain system after a major seismic event.
