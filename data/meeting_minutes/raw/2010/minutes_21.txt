Commissioner Antonini:
There are a couple of items in the press today that I want to comment on: (1) I was happy to hear that the proposed ballot measure regarding shadow impacts might not come up in June as originally thought. And since we are in the process of considering whether the present system properly addresses Prop K, I think it would be inappropriate for the voters to see that before we have had a chance to weigh in on it. (2) The other issue was hybrid elections. Iâve been through the situation with the Board of Supervisors being elected at large and twice by districts and I think both times have not been successful. I think they are toovulcanizedbalkanizedand I think this has a lot of implications in land use because we are seeing increasingly more and more land use decisions being made by the Board of Supervisors and less power at the Planning Commission. Some of these ideas should be discussed because I think there is a happy medium that might provide for representation of the neighborhoods while still having people have a say city wide. Ideally, I think it would be great if we had a situation where there were five at large and six by districts. Then each voter would be properly represented because they would have a votefromfora majority of those being elected.
Commissioner Miguel:
I had an interesting situation on Monday. The President of the Planning Commission is automatically an ex-officio member of the Arts Commission and I get there on a somewhat regular basis. They were going over their five-year Strategic Plan. One of the things that they have down is partnerships and involvements with other city departments. One of the things that came up â and when I mentioned that, they seemed receptive and that the Department might take note of it â is the fact that we are currently encouraging on large building sites that are sitting fallow because of the economy, that they do a greening; that they clean them up; and everything. This would be an ideal situation for the Arts Commission to put in some temporary public art. The cooperation between the two departments in coordinating that seemed to resonate with them. If we could do a little follow up on that, it might work out quite well.
Yesterday, SPUR did one of their noon time forums which three of the Departmentâs staff presented on the public realm. It was extremely well presented and extremely well received by SPUR.
I had a chance to speak with Supervisor Dufty this week on a number of Planning Department current situations and that went quite well. Yesterday there was another in the series of DR Reform meetings. Several neighborhood association representatives were there. I thought the meeting went quite well. It was a small meeting but the representations were varied city wide. The explanations worked out quite well. I think we are getting a great deal of buy in from neighborhood organizations that we did not have before.
Commissioner Antonini:
I too participated in one of those meetings on DR and I want to compliment Elaine Forbes and Elizabeth Watty and Craig Nikitas â I donât know if anyone else from staff was present that night. I thought it was extremely useful and a very good cross section of a lot of neighborhood groups and some good comments. I thought a lot of good progress was made.
Commissioner Lee:
I have just one item as an administrative process. We need to do Secretary Linda Averyâs job performance review.
4. Directorâs Announcements
Director Rahaim:
I have a couple of things: Last night I sent to all of you and the Board of Supervisors and the Mayor our analysis on that proposed shadow initiative that Commissioner Antonini mentioned. We did attend the hearing this morning, and as Iâm sure youâve probably heard by now the Supervisors who proposed that initiative have withdrawn it from the ballot for June and have proposed a more robust public process around some of these issues, including the technical updates that we have been working on that you heard from Craig Nikitas on. So we will be engaged in that. This has just happened so as we get that process nailed down, we will come back to you with more information. I want to take a moment to thank Craig Nikitas for all his work on this. That memo you received last night was primarily his work. He has spent a lot of time on that this week to understand the full implications of that measure.
Second, I will be out of the office tomorrow attending a Park Design charrette in San Jose at the invitation of the Arts Administrator in San Jose who is an old friend and colleague. Weâll be working down there for the afternoon on a riverfront park project that they are proposing. That should be interesting.
Finally, I did attend the Historic Preservation Commission yesterday and talked about our budget and got some more feedback from them as well. Their recommendations to you were similar to what you heard last week. They did discuss the possibility of writing a memo and decided in the end to have the President come to speak to you in person next week during your budget meeting. I know that Commissioner Sugaya is interested in getting something from them in writing so Iâll talk to them about that. Just to remind you of the schedule: it is before you next week on the 11thand if necessary, before them on the 17th, and for your final action on the 18thand is due to the Mayorâs Budget Office on Monday, the 22nd. We need to keep to that schedule as well.
5. Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS
Land Use Committee:
·Interim Controls related to the Inclusionary Housing Requirements âThis resolution was introduced by the Mayor and Board President Chiu in light of the recent court decision âPalmer/6thST Properties vs. City of Los Angeles.â The interim controls would ensure that projects currently moving through the entitlement process will conform to the requirements of the draft permanent controls in that it would modify Section 315 to a fee-based Affordable Housing Program requiring all projects to pay an affordable housing fee to the Mayorâs Office of Housing.This week the Committee recommended approval to the Full Board and the Full Board adopted the item the next day.
·Supervisor Chiuâs Parking Requirements and Garage Installation in Existing Residential Buildings in Telegraph Hill, North Beach and Chinatown âThe Planning Commission heard this item on January 14 of this year. At that hearing the Commission recommended expanding the geographic boundaries of the SUD so that the controls would affect a larger area. The Commission recommended modifying the criteria to be considered when hearing Conditional Use applications to add new garages into existing buildings. Those eight criteria you recommended include: 1) removal of residential unit 2) decrease in habitable area; 3) adverse impact on historic resource; 4) umber of parking spaces vs. loss of 0n-street parking spaces; 5) sidewalk accessibility; 6) design guidelines; 7) n0-fault evictions; and 8) priority policies. In addition, the Commission recommended that new procedures be implemented during review of these applications to include review by DPW and MTA. The Commission recommended removing a component of the Supervisorâs proposal that would have prohibited DPW encroachment permits for new garages citywide. Further, instead of tying prohibitions strictly to street width, the Commission recommended specifying specific alleys and streets in the area where new curb cuts would be prohibited. Supervisor Chiu amended the legislation to integrate all but one of the Commissionâsrecommendations. The Supervisor indicated that he plans to address the remaining issue (potential expansion of the SUD) in trailing legislation.With those amendments, the Committee recommended approval of the proposed ordinance to the Full Board.
Rules Committee:
·Director Rahaim has given the report on the proposed initiative to protect park sunlight
BOARD OF APPEALS:
46 Sussex StreetâThis was a garage on a back alley that required a variance. Neighbors were split because it had turned into an open space. While there were garages, slowly but surely the alley space had been turned into a green space. I denied the variance. It was continued for a while at the Board of Appeals to determine whether there was a compromise to a smaller garage. The denial of the variance was upheld +2 -2.
100 32ndAvenueâYou might be familiar with that project. The appellant argued that the building was above the 30 foot height limit and was out of character with the neighborhood. The Board voted +3 -2 to uphold the variance decision, but +2 -3 to uphold the Commissionâs approval. (Although a minority vote, the Commissionâs decision was upheld.)
2244-50 Mason Streetâ The appellants (two tenants in the building) argued that the project would result in their eviction and the property owner had not been maintaining the property. The item was continued to the CALL OF THE CHAIR.
Historic Preservation Commission:
Director Rahaim has given this report under Directorâs Report.
