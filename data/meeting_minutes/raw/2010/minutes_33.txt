Commissioner Moore:
I came across a notice of the revised preparation of an environmental impact 
statement for the project in Brisbane called -- I do not remember what its name 
is. What struck me about the project is the enormous size to which this project 
has increased, and while we are aware that the project is happening and is 
bordered on the east side of highway 101, the increase in residential units, the 
decrease in open space is of great concern to me because it does reflect our 
considerations on a number of projects. The project is suggesting 4434 
residential drawing units, which were never considered in the previous EIR. The 
project produces 330 acres of open space, which for an area as large as this 
project is, is rather reasonable and reduces the area to 205 acres, in addition 
to its 7 million square feet of office, retail, industrial, and institutional 
users. The reason why I' m quoting the numbers is only for us to keep it at 
least in the corner of our eye as we move forward, looking at project, which 
border both sides of the freeway and which we are looking at for transportation 
and other impacts. So if anybody wants to read this brief outline, I would be 
happy to pass it on, but I think is important to be aware of.
Commissioner Borden:
There was an item on December 5 in the Chronicle newspaper in the real estate 
column, and it makes reference to a project. I contacted the Zoning 
Administrator because I was concerned.  We often have people come before the 
Commission saying that it was a shock to us that it was a single family home. 
Our Zoning Administrator contacted the realtor, who said that the newspapermisrepresented what was conveyed. I wrote a letter to the newspaper asking them 
to print my letter to the editor pointing out that indeed, the property is 
actually zoned for five units.Not only is it sold for five units, it was turned down for a dwelling unit 
merger in 2005 by this Commission.  The newspaper said they are not the real 
estate police and that the properties and a listing, we checked it. The point is 
if you see something advertised in newspaperseven on the 
real-estate page, the likelihood is that it is owned in a way for multiple 
dwelling units and that you should check into that because we do not like the 
demolition of dwelling units in the City that has a housing shortage. I just 
want to caution people about this challenge so that it is out there, so we do 
not have people coming before us. It is really unfortunate that the newspaper 
was less cooperative on that point.
Commissioner Antonini:
Many of you may have noticed in the "Chronicle" yesterday an article about a 
group that was kind of objecting to a policy that is being considered, which is, 
I guess, discouraging additional building near dense areas, which may be sources 
of pollution by freeways, by other areas, which is sort of counter intuitive, 
and sort of the reverse, as he pointed out quite well. This is under discussion 
at the present time, but I have seen this brought up a couple of times where we 
have to really look, and there could be evaluations of the air quality near any 
new building going on, and using this as an evaluator on the approval, and I 
think he may be jumping a little bit ahead, but it seems to me it is not 
environmental to build dense housing and new housing further and further away 
from populated areas and increasing commutes, increasing pollution. I was glad 
to hear that somebody kind of picked up on that.
Second, I was very unhappy to hear about State Compensation Insurance fund is 
apparently moving in number of their employees out of San Francisco, and I would 
expect that probably the chamber or the Mayor's Office or others in the City 
have worked with these groups and tried to meet their needs and find these sites 
for them here. Ironically, they had a building approved a couple of years ago, 
but economic factors were such that it ended up never getting billed, and I 
believe it was converted into housing, and it is going to be a housing unit. 
Interestingly, in that article is that in addition to the cost savings they 
would have by relocating to people to areas that were a lot less expensive, they 
also felt there was a shortage of qualified personnel within maybe not 
necessarily only San Francisco, but in the general area, so I think this is very 
much in keeping with the symposium I was part of today on middle-class housing 
and what we can do to promote that because there probably is a situation where 
many of the people who might be possible employees for firms such as this are 
having trouble finding housing in San Francisco and are having to come from a 
distance away. So it is something to think about, something to reflect on. 
Hopefully to work with companies to find out what we can do to address heir 
concerns.
Commissioner Sugaya:
When I first came on the Commission about four and a half years ago, the issue 
of the Brisbane Bay Lands -- I do not know what they are calling it now -- was 
on my mind because I knew the Planning Director down there. Naively, I thought 
it would be interesting if two commissions could discuss the issues surrounding 
the development. Specially since at that time, there was no housing being 
proposed on the site. We find this kind of -- I have to be careful how I say 
things. anyway, about other communities -- Brisbane has, I think, a kind of 
approach to this which said that they did not want any housing there. You find 
that in other communities around the bay area. Alameda has no multiple family 
housing policy.
So we are faced here in San Francisco with the a big housing allocations, and 
you begin to wonder how their housing communities are fulfilling their 
requirements. So I'm kind of encouraged by what Commissioner Moore said. The new 
proposal, it is interesting that this is coming back around in a certain way 
that I think is of greater benefit, and the hope of having a joint meeting, as 
I' m sure is not even close to in the cards. Maybe they listen to some policy 
things that are going on in the greater bay area. I' m encouraged by that, and 
we should keep an eye on this since it is right next to our southern border.
Commissioner Olague:
We have not had a chance to really look at the calendar because we have been so 
busy with other things, but a couple of weeks ago, I requested that we have an 
MTA presentation.I just want to keep that on the radar. Most of the commissioners really agreed 
to that also, they have some interesting ideas, plans in the works, so I think 
they are ones that directly relate to a lot of the discussions we have here to 
the extent that we can be informed on what they are looking toward, I think it 
would be good. Also, a couple of weeks ago, asked during the Park Merced hearing 
-- I wanted to understand the staff' s rationale behind parking requirements and 
what comes to us as a sustainable development. So I want to know if there is any 
kind of, you know, set of criteria or how does the Dpartment look at parking 
requirements as it relates to a green project or sustainable project. And then, 
someone asked me if there is any right things that were interesting as they 
relate to San Francisco, Chester Hartman comes to mind, and another writer that 
we were talking about was Rebecca Solmet wrote some interesting books as well. I 
just wanted to put that out there.
Commissioner Miguel:
I also read the article that Commissioner Antonini referred to, and it seemed to 
me that perhaps one part of the Bay Area Air Quality Board not talking to the 
other part of the board or something -- either they are going to be 
transit-oriented development in order to improve air quality, or you are going 
to say that there is too much air pollution near transit, and therefore move it 
further out. I' m not quite sure which one is going to take hold, but the 
dichotomy totally confuses me.Also, on -- the one thing that was missing from the article regarding the state 
offices moving outside of San Francisco -- my first question was -- what are 
they considered qualifying workers, or are they paying so low they cannot 
compete? It made no sense to me at all. I think you all know the number of 
people who would normally be qualified to work for that agency that live in San 
Francisco and are looking for a work, so I was totally confused by that article 
as well.Just to mention, during the past week, I met with the PUC regarding the 
Calaveras Dam Project, and had a very pleasurable situation yesterday morning of 
attending a groundbreaking jointly .Actually, two major projects in this case by Martin Buildings that are with 
amazingly complicated financing, coming forward. The financing is just 
unbelievable when they went into the details of nine years of work altogether, 
but at least we have two major rental housing projects that have broken ground, 
and that was an absolute pleasure to be on.

Directorâs Announcements
Kelley Amdur:
I wanted to let you know that we did have a public meeting last Saturday morning 
at the Planning Department. We reached out to our group that we call the action 
plan stakeholders group about a year to a year-and-a-half ago. We had a couple 
of meetings at the library with over 100 people in attendance. Now that we are 
wrapping up a lot of the items, part of our action plan, we held an additional 
meeting to inform the public of that, and we had an attendance of about 20, 
which we think is a good sign that a lot of what we are trying to do was well 
received. A lot of our presentation will be in January.
Also, John Rahaim wanted to wish you happy holidays, since this is your last 
meeting before your holiday break.
