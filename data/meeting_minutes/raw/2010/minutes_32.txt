C.COMMISSIONERSâ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
Commission Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements.  
Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or 
inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.  
At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a 
Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda 
of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Miguel:
Rather than comment earlier, I thought I would save it for here, as to the 
possibility ofan offsite meeting in December regarding Park Merced, there was comment from 
Commissioners here that was affirmative in that regard. I've spoken with a 
number of people from that area and  organizations, as well as with the Mayor's 
Office of Economic, and Work Force Development. I am sure we will hear from 
later this afternoon as well on Park Mercedand the concept is that doing such a truthfully massive and extremely involved 
project onwhich we are going to -- and we will hear more in detail laterthis afternoon, a number of informational hearings, was the thought that those 
particularmatters regarding the project that are of most interest to theresidents, the tenants, and the general neighborhood, would best be heard there. 
And so I have, actually, been working with Director Rahaim and with the Mayor's 
Office, the Economic Work Force Development to determine which items would be 
heard there, which ones would normally be heard here, any actual votes would be 
done here, I know it's an unusual situation. Not that totally difficult to 
accomplish and we will get more details, as we go along.
Commissioner Moore:
I support what you said. It's a very large community and we need to be out there 
doing what we do. I was extremely proud to hear national television label us as 
the most beautiful City in the country which we obviously all know. We all try 
to contribute to keeping it that way, but it was wonderful to hear. I want to 
commend the City on how well they organized the thing, that not a speck of 
anything, orange, black, or  whatever, when you walk across the big plaza down 
the streets. it's remarkable with so many present that they organized it as well 
as they did. It was fabulous to watch and I am happy the City was able to pull 
it off that well.
On another note, I attended a meeting last night at the Southeast Community 
Center, Candlestick Point state recreation area,  the parks service presented 
the plan. It was a number of people that come here that showed up. What I was 
concerned about, and I am not speaking about the design and how it's being done, 
but there's a slight disconnect bringing the Candlestick Hunter Point forward to 
open space connections. The design as presented last night does not seem to be 
fully on top of the knowledge and the breadth of what was done in that plan. I 
hope there will be a meeting of minds for those two groups that come together 
and work out where the marches need to occur. The other thing I want to talk 
about is there are two items which were settled and off our calendar today, 
those are items 12 and 14. And I want to comment on the weakness and short 
comings of the drawings which accompanied both of these projects. I am 
continuously dismayed and have been for many years that we are not encouraging 
more consistent sets being submitted to us, relative to what is depicted and how 
it is depicted. I would probably call these two drawings remotely sophomoric. 
Perhaps my first year of architecture school, that's about where this is. For 
this Commission that is not consistent or appropriate to render the type of 
decisions we need to make and I want to help and empower the Department that 
generally we are raising the bar of what is being expected as a minimum for 
visual depiction in these applications. Sometimes we see window sill details and 
foundation details which don't really matter. But what we really want to see is 
how does it fit the context of the neighborhood, to how does it meet the 
Department's guidelines to determine them. Three dimensional or whatever, but 
these sets are way short of what the Department should be able to expect. Just 
want to put that into the discussion and see if we can help, perhaps, develop a 
set of criteria to help the Department.
Commissioner Antonini:
Like all of us thrilled with the Giants World Series Victory, particularly it 
happened on Monday so we aren't sitting here biting our nails for the possible 
seventh game today. I might have been there, but in any case, it was a thrill to 
walk up the same steps todaythat the Giants walked down on the entrance to City Hall and this does rekindle 
our image as a City which we used to be known as 80 years ago. That has fallen 
by the wayside recently, but the way it was handled yesterday, between the City, 
the Giants, and the Project Sponsors, how well it was done.
On a smaller scale, but also I think of equal importance, today was the first 
round of golf tournament out at Harding Park, which was the champions, and some 
of the names that my age is more familiar with, Tom Watson and Fred couples are 
among the participants out there. It's the second major tournament in two years 
there will be another, and I would like to acknowledge the former and present 
supervisor who were instrumental in refurbishing Harding Park and making it 
great for local golfers and world champions alike. I am optimistic we can do the 
same thing in the future with our other capital assets, and improve them and 
bring them back to their former greatness so a good step in the right direction, 
thank you.
Commissioner Sugaya:
I am going to wear former Commissioner Bill Lee's hat for a moment. The Traveler 
Magazine has named San Francisco the most favorite City for travel in the U.S., 
so -- and I just wanted to comment on Commissioner Moore's Candlestick Park. I 
am sure they are going to have a lot of time to come to a meeting of the minds 
given the State budget and the failure of prop 21.
