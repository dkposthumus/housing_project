BAYVIEW HUNTERS POINT REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND REZONING -Public Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Report- The proposed project is the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency's (SFRA) proposed Bayview Hunters Point (BVHP) Redevelopment Plan, and amendments to the India Basin Industrial Park (IBIP) and Bayview Industrial Triangle (BIT) Redevelopment Plans and rezoning in the Project Area.  The Project Area is located in the southeastern quadrant of the City and County of San Francisco in the area generally bounded by Cesar Chavez Street to the north, US 101 to the west, San Mateo County to the south, and the San Francisco Bay to the east.  The proposed redevelopment program would institute tax increment financing for the area added to the Hunters Point Redevelopment Project and for the Bayview Industrial Triangle Redevelopment Project, and would rezone land in the Bayview Hunters Point area.  The total allocation of net new floor area within the Bayview Hunters Point Redevelopment Area would be approximately 2.2 million square feet by 2020.  The potential mall at Candlestick Park would comprise approximately half of this new floor area and the remaining floor area would be spread throughout the activity nodes, with the Hunters Point Shoreline Activity Node receiving the greatest percentage of net new square footage.  Approximately 6,200 net new employees would work in the Bayview Hunters Point Redevelopment Area.  In addition, the Redevelopment Area would see an increase of approximately 3,600 new dwelling units by 2020.  The northern section of the Project Area is zoned Light Industrial (M-1) and Heavy Industrial (M-2).  The Third Street commercial corridor is zoned primarily Neighborhood Commercial (NC-3), with pockets of Light and Heavy Industrial zoning on the northern and southern edges of the corridor.  Residentially zoned land is located east and west of Third Street.  Residential, Industrial and Neighborhood Commercial zoning classifications are in the Hunters Point Shoreline area.  Other pockets of Neighborhood Shopping zoning are along Gilman Avenue and along Hunters Point Boulevard and Innes Avenue.  The southern portions of the Project Area generally are zoned Residential and Heavy Commercial, and Public within the Candlestick Point area.
Preliminary Recommendation:  No action required.
Note: Written comments will be received at the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m. on December 10, 2004.
SPEAKER(S):
Francisco DeCosta - Environmental Justice Advocacy
- He works at the San Francisco Presidio.
- There are major changes made of over 9,000 parcels and 2,500 acres.
- The report has been very hastily prepared.
- There is very little reference proposed for the ethnicity of the area.
- African-Americans have contributed a lot to the area.
- He has always stressed for quality of life issues, transparency, etc. and these are not found in the document.
Ron Morgan
- He lives on Richland Avenue.
- He thanked the various organizations for this plan.
- The plan is comprehensive and impressive.
- The Bayshore Industrial corridor concerns him because it would create a new zoning category.  This change promotes big box retail.
- He does not want to sound as if he were against the EIR.  He just has some concerns about it.
Barbara Kyle
- He is not opposed or supportive of the plan, she just has concerns about the Bayshore area.
- She is concerned with creating a big box alley in the Bayshore area.
- The Cortland/Bayshore area was not included in the traffic impact section.  This is important because it is a very high traffic area.
- Her other concern has to do with small businesses.  There are a lot of small parcels in the area so there is no room for big box businesses.
Angelo King - BVHP PAC Chair
- He is part of the Bayview Hunters Point Committee.
- He has talked to the planners since he is not an expert.
- Home Depot has it's own EIR that is why this should be considered separately.
- The EIR should be passed since it will be the first step in improving the area.
Mike Hammon
- He lives in the Bayview and has a business there.
- He also serves in the committee.
- There have been thousands of meetings, many hours of manpower, etc.
- They have encouraged people to get involved.
- It is not right to allow an "11thhour" derailment of this project.
- Every meeting he has attended the number one concern is jobs.
- This corridor has been designated as an economic opportunity.
- It is not right for some elite people on the hill to deny the neighborhood's best interest.
Nic Griffin
- She lives in Bernal Heights.
- She has a great deal of concern for the neighborhood.
- The new PDR large commercial zoning is not appropriate.
- The Bayview is flat and Bernal Heights is very "hilly".
- The traffic has greatly increased in Bernal Heights.
- Cortland will be one of the main routes to get to this new commercial district so this street is very important.
- She would hate to see this plan be stopped just because of one area but it is important to consider the area separately.
Azalia Merrell - Carpenter's Union
- She grew up in Bernal Heights.
- There are a lot of young people that are coming out of the Bayview Hunters Point area.
- This area is very important for it to have jobs created.
Sue Hestor
- She is representing Cole Hardware.
- It would be helpful to acknowledge that there are adjacent neighborhoods and not just freeways.
- There are issues that need to be dealt with in regards to Cortland Avenue and Bernal Heights.
- All the same Bayshore intersections need to be analyzed equally.  Yet Cortland Avenue is not included in the document.
Bree LeMaire
- Her backyard over looks what used to be Goodman Lumber.
- When Goodman Lumber moved out, the graffiti and the weeds moved in.
- Cortland Avenue can manage any more traffic coming through.
- There are trucks parked on Cortland Avenue so this causes traffic jams.
- She wants to help to provide jobs but putting a big box there would not help.
- There are a lot of small business owners that are doing very well there.
Mike Boss
- He is a resident of Bernal Heights and has a business there.
- He is supportive of the economic redevelopment of Hunter's Point.
- Neighbors have borders so Bernal Heights would greatly be impacted by big box retailers.
Linda Richardson - Commissioner
- This plan has taken about nine years to develop and thousands of hours.
- This is a very comprehensive plan.
- She is very familiar with the development of the City.
- This plan will help to revitalize an area that has been ignored for many years.
- The Home Depot project has gone through a lot of scrutiny so the Bay View Hunter's Point should not be "held hostage".
(first name unclear) Hutchinson
- It does not matter what is built in the neighborhood.  What is important is that people will be going to work.
- It does not matter what nationality they are either.
Charlie Walker
- He is unhappy about this.
- Bernal Heights cannot have it the way they want it all the time.
