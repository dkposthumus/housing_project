Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the change of use.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Brennan Murphy - Discretionary Review Requestor - Sunset Neighbors for Action
- There have been 4,200 signatures against this project.
- The project sits at the edge of a small commercial zone.
- This would be the first national corporate run store in the area.
- Starbuck's signed the agreement without having any sort of community input.
- There is no need to have this type of business here because there are already two independently owned coffee shops.
- Starbucks would also occupy space that could be used for a neighborhood owned retail use.
- Starbucks does not provide any sort of opportunity for resident ownership.  Instead of preserving neighborhood retail use it would probably cause the other coffee shops to close.
- The project would also cause traffic problems as well as pedestrian traffic because they plan to have many tables on the sidewalk.
- Starbuck's is not a modest coffee retail use.
(-) Nan Radich
- She is a very concerned teacher and resident.
- The Sunset is the City's best kept secret and this Seattle based company will disrupt the peace in the neighborhood.
- The neighborhood cannot hold on to its diversity if Starbucks is allowed.
- The Neighbors of the Sunset are not in support of this project.
- Starbucks did not even have the consideration to speak to the community before signing a contract.
(-) Mary Spoerer
- She lives in the inner sunset and shops there.
- She appreciates the character of the neighborhood.  This is why she does not support this project.
(-) Amrah Johnson - Associated Students of CCSF Ocean Campus
- The students of City College are not in support of this project.  Many of the students are enrolled in the Restaurant and Hospitality program and one day would like to open their own small businesses.
- Students should have the ability to pursue their dream.
(-) Michael Crotty
- He lives in the Sunset District, one block away from the proposed project.
- He is outraged that Starbucks is trying to destroy the many years of hard work that one of the café's in the neighborhood has tried to obtain.
- If Starbucks opens, it will crush this café as well as other independently owned retail stores.
(-) D.J. Canepa - Assemblyman Leland Yee's Office
- He read a letter dated September 2, 2003, from Leland Yee who is opposed to this chain store.  He is in support of independently owned small businesses.
(-) Amanda Janes - Sunset Neighbors for Action
- She lives about five blocks from the proposed site.
- She is opposed to the project.
- Starbucks is a global corporation and a small business owner cannot compete with them.
- Starbucks has stated that if they do not open a coffee shop there, someone else will.  Although this might be true, Starbucks would totally impede the opportunity for small entrepreneurs.
(-) Patrick McGuire - Sunset Neighbors for Action
- He was born in the neighborhood and now owns a small business there.
- Even people who do patronize Starbucks, would not like to have a store open there.
- Parking will become a problem because the infrastructure of the location does not support that type of store there.
- It will be more than likely that people will double park and cause problems for the "N" Judah MUNI line.
- If this use is allowed, it will give a "green light" for other chain stores to open and totally change the character of the neighborhood.
(-) Ron Dudum - Westside Democratic Club
- He was born in the neighborhood.
- 4,000 neighborhoods have identified that their neighborhood character is threatened with this project.
- Perhaps another coffee shop can open in the neighborhood but not a nationally owned chain store.
(-) Joel Ventresca -SPEAK
- This project will endanger independently owned businesses.
- This project will violate proposition M.
- Starbucks is the type of company that does not promote fair hiring.
(-) Ralf Lane
- He is a fifth generation San Franciscan.
- He cares about the character of the neighborhood.
- He is the commercial landlord next door to the proposed project.
- Bringing in an international chain is not a lifesaver for more rent in the neighborhood.
- The neighborhood is doing just fine with the small businesses there.
(-) Tess Manola-Ventresca - Coordinator for the Sunset Neighbors for Action
- Starbucks has very little use at this location.
- The independently owned businesses can hire local musicians and singers.
(-) Carlo Grunfeld - Sunset Neighbors for Action
- He is here representing the various people who could not be here.
- There are already several excellent coffee Stores.
- Parking in the avenues is already at full capacity.
- He would like the Commission to take Discretionary Review and disapprove the project.
(-) Nicky Trasviña - Sunset Neighbors for Action
- She was born in San Francisco and through the years she has seen the invasion of chain stores "creeping" into neighborhoods.  These have caused small businesses to close and have closed the door on old fashion customer service.
- She is also a member of the Saint Paul's Presbyterian Church, located one block away from the project site.  She has found that the neighborhood is made up of working class people that are not the type to go to Starbucks.
(-) Rick Young
- It is very clear how the residents feel.  The hearing room is full of people who oppose Starbuck's and there have been so many signatures from others who are also against it.
- Would the Commission, if they were residents of the Sunset, open a restaurant if there was going to be a Starbucks?
- The area is better served by not having a Starbuck's there.
(-) Bernard Crotty
- He was a member of the Commission on Aging for both Mayors Willie Brown and Frank Jordan.
- He has always had a great working relationship with the neighborhood merchants association.
- He hopes that the Commission will not approve this project and support the small business community of this city.
(-) Stacey McCann
- She was born and raised in the neighborhood.
- The lower sunset is a special community.  It remains untouched by commercialism.
- If the City allows these types of businesses in the neighborhood, the community will forever be tarnished.
(-) (name unclear)
- She moved to San Francisco because of its uniqueness and diversity.
- She likes the community feel of the neighborhood because she is from a small town.
- She would like to preserve small businesses in the area.
(-) Barbara Laily
- She lives in the neighborhood and is opposed to the project.
- There are three coffee shops independently owned and there is no need for this type of corporate chain.
- If this project is allowed, it will bring other chain stores, causing other small businesses to close.
(-) Amy Laitinen - Supervisor Gonzalez's Office
- There is a letter from the Supervisor supporting of the residents of the Sunset.  He does not support allowing this type of use in the area.
(-) Lucy Quacinella
- She was lucky enough to buy a home in the Sunset District.
- This area does have a small town feel.
- She urges the Commission to listen to the many eloquent voices that have expressed their opposition.
- The residents also have the right to be listened to so they can preserve the quality of life in their neighborhoods.
(-) Luis Granados - Mission Economic Development Corporation
- He is here to request that the Commission take Discretionary Review and not approve the change of use.
- This project meets all the uses, so the issue is not about that.  The issue is about what the community wants and what they want to preserve.
- The Commission needs to decide what they are basing their decision on.
- The Planning staff made a wrong decision.
- The Commission can rectify this mistake and not approve the project.
(+) Tim Tosta - Steefel, Levitt and Weiss - Representing Starbucks
- He gave a PowerPoint type of presentation regarding the aspects of the project.
- The neighborhood has a number of small scale stores and is adjacent to a residential neighborhood.
- The store which Starbuck's intends to occupy has been vacant for over a year.  It is a modest store in character.
- It is not anticipated to have a large number of cars travel to this location.  There will be more pedestrian traffic.
- He displayed a map of where other Starbuck's businesses are near the neighborhood.
- The other smaller coffee shops are a lot larger in square footage than the location where the Starbuck's is intended.

(Continued from Regular Meeting of December 18, 2003)
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Amy Laitinen - Supervisor Gonzalez's Office
- She is glad to know that the Commission is in support of the intent of the legislation.
- This legislation is basically to protect small business, neighborhood character and the local economy.
- She spoke on the changes that were made and the reasons for them.
- The number was increased for a variety of reasons.  There have been numerous conversations with the Planning Department, merchants associations and the City Attorney.  They felt that there were a fair number of businesses that don't fit the "retail formula use" with five or six stores.  Once there are more than 10, it starts to fit more like a chain store.
- One of the main reasons for this legislation is to protect small businesses in San Francisco that are being pushed out by larger businesses.
- The majority of small businesses are single locations.  Of multiple location businesses with only two stores.
- There is a small amount of businesses that this legislation will affect but these are the ones they are trying to target.
(-) Steven Sarver
- He and his wife own a small business.  He now has six stores and family members operate all of them.
- He and his family enjoy working and living in San Francisco.
- He is concerned with this legislation because there are proposals to open two more stores.
- There are thousands of people in the financial district that have suggested they open more businesses.
- This legislation would hinder their growth.
- He as well as other small business owners should be allowed to open stores throughout San Francisco so long as there is a demand.
(+) Paul Wermer
- He is a member of the Neighborhood Network.
- He supports this legislation.
- San Francisco is known for district neighborhoods.
- This ordinance strikes a good balances because it provides opportunities for neighborhoods to decide how they will develop.
- Although this will add more of a workload to the Planning Department he would like to have this legislation approved.
(-) Jaime Rossi
- He understands the purpose of this legislation but he believes that it is a little arbitrary.
- In bad economic times, things like this are more hurtful than beneficial.
- He believes that for the economic outlook of this City, there should not be more burden placed on retailers.
(-) Anna Shimko - Cassidy, Shimko & Dawson on behalf of Safeway
- She is representing Safeway who is opposed to this legislation.
- Grocery services are very vital.
- The legislation would have various impacts on low and moderate-income families.
- If the legislation should pass, she asked that grocery stores not be included.
- The legislation does not provide information for appeals.
- There are many, many reasons she urges the Commission to vote against this legislation.
(+/-) My Do - MEDA
- She is a bit confused about how this legislation will impact their small business clients.
- The question she has is "If the store is considered formula retail, what percentage of the store needs to be formula retail?"
- Will the legislation have a significant negative impact?
- She does not oppose the legislation, she would just like to have it further refined to make it more understandable.
(+/-) Luis Granados - Mission Economic Development Association
- He has some questions about the legislation.
- Small businesses would benefit by this legislation.
- He would ask the planners to do an analysis of this legislation.
- He is generally in support of this legislation but he would recommend that the Commission approach it with caution.
(+) Alan Martinez
- All this is about notification.
- There is also the issue of preserving historical storefronts.
(+) Ed Bedard - Hayes Valley Neighborhood Association
- This legislation came out of his neighborhood.
- They have had several battles with formula retail stores coming into their neighborhood.
- There have been a lot of people from the community come to various neighborhood meetings on this.
- The purpose of all this is to protect the assets that this City has.
(+) Tes Welborn
- They are very supportive of this type of legislation.
- She is thrilled that this is on the table.
- Small businesses and local character is very much needed in neighborhoods.
- The idea of having to notify the neighborhood and notify the other business about retail that is coming in is not a burdensome thing to do.
- Local character is very important.
(+) Flip Sarrow - Haight/Ashbury Neighborhood
- He represents over 60 merchants on Haight Street and everyone supports this legislation.
- No all franchises notify the residents.
- This legislation is important so that the merchants can have some say on what the neighborhood is going to be.
- People come to the Haight because they want to have a unique shopping experience.
- This type of legislation that states what types of businesses are going to move into neighborhoods is good legislation.
(+/-) Joe O'Donaghue - Residential Builders
- Small businesses are hurt by this so called protectionism legislation.
- Poor people are hurt when prices are higher.
- He does not consider a business a character so businesses should be allowed in every neighborhood and not be concerned about changing its character.
(+) Leigh Stackpole - HVMA - Gimme Shoes
- She owns a business with three locations in San Francisco.
- She has worked hard to grow her business.
- She supports this legislation.
- Her accountant and graphic artist are located on Hayes Street.
(+/-) Lorn Dittfeld - Hayes Valley
- One of the greatest revenue sources is not from any chain store it is from tourism.
- People do not come to San Francisco to shop at the Gap, Starbucks, etc.  Tourists come for the local character that every neighborhood has.
(+) Jim Siagal - Haight Ashbury Merchants Association
- He pleads with the Commission to pass this legislation.
- Residents need to protect the character that each neighborhood has.
(-) Tim Tosta
- His principal concern about this legislation is that it really is not intended for just the Hayes Valley or the Haight.  It is intended to create a definition for formula retail and get it on the "books."
- Once this is on the "books," it will be the political father of every district supervisor to protect one or another district.
- He does not believe that there is the data that equates chains with loss.  There is very much confusion with the data.
(+) Peter Cohen - Hayes Valley Neighborhood Association
- Chain stores are not evil, yet they have a real impact on small businesses.
- Neighborhood character is very important to residents of San Francisco.  That is why tourists come here.
- The vast majority of retail businesses are small in scale.
- Neighborhood notification is very important because it gives the neighborhood the chance to get a "heads up" on what is proposed.
ACTION: Hearing Held.  Item continued to January 22, 2004, to allow staff time to express the Commission's concerns in a draft resolution.
AYES: Antonini, Bradford Bell, Boyd, Feldstein, Hughes, S. Lee, W. Lee
G. PUBLIC COMMENT

With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.

(3)  directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.  (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))
SPEAKER(S):
Joe O'Donaghue - Residential Builders
Re:  Building Department and Planning Commission
- Early this week, from the Mayor's Office operatives through the press, there was a trial by press done which reflected very poorly on the now Mayor including the staff that operated in the manner in which they did.
- They ignored protocol.  They ignored going before the Commission and also ignored the process of going through department heads.
- It was stated that a monitor would be implemented.  One [monitor] was going to be appointed by Mayor Newsom because of corruption in that department [DBI].
- He would like to state for the record that the Residential Builders process about 300 permits a year out of 55,000 permits.  Of these 55,000 permits, 95 percent are approved within 72 hours.
- This states that the productivity record is phenomenal.
Lois Scott
Re:  Meltdown at the Planning Department
- Over the Christmas Holiday, the Office of Environmental Review lost their server so the people at 30 Van Ness were not able to work on their computers.
- The OASIS staff were able to fix things with a zero budget.
- The conservative cost of this meltdown is about $80,000.
- Tomorrow, four executive offices are going to be moved at the department which will cost about $8,000.  There are questions--if at this time of budget problems,  this is an appropriate expense?
- When there is a mismatch of resources against workload it is very difficult to meet the service goals and performance criteria that the Newsom administration wants.  She hopes that the Department will meet these goals.
Merilyn Amini
Re:  Speaker Time
- She has waited seven hours to mention that earlier her time was shortened.  Section 67.15c of the Sunshine Ordinance states that each policy body shall allow a public speaker [the opportunity] to speak up to three minutes.  It states "up to" because she is not obligated to speak the full three minutes.
Adjournment: 11:01 p.m.
THESE MINUTES ARE PROPOSED FOR ADOPTION AT THE REGULAR MEETING OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON THURSDAY, February 5, 2004.
SPEAKERS: None
ACTION: Approved as Corrected
