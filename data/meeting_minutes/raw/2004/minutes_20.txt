C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT
9. Director's Announcements
- He is glad to be back after a week off on vacation.
Re:  Discretionary Reviews

Re:  Housing Element

Re:  Fee Package
- On May 27, 2004, there will be a fee package that blends into the Mayor's proposed budget.
- Last year the fee package ran into some legal issues before the Board of Supervisors.
- Staff has been working very closely with the Mayor's office on this.
John Bardis - Inner Sunset Action Committee
Re:  Scheduling the Housing Element
- They have been concerned about when the Housing Element will be scheduled.
- The point is that this item does have precedent.
- He can understand when there is no controversy and a judicious move has to be done.
- There is actually a very urgent appeal and it should have a separate hearing.
- So the question comes up is everything being done properly?
Marilyn Amini
Re:  Miscellaneous Planning Matters
- Acting Director Badiner stated that there was no Board of Supervisors Meeting when there was.
- At that hearing there were about 70 pieces of property that were transferred.
- All of these properties have a specific area where neighbors should be notified.
- She came to the Planning Department to ask for information on the NEMIZ and waited for about an hour but was later told that she was not able to receive a copy.
- When the item of the Housing Element is scheduled it should be timely because information has not been made available to the public and the hearing is next week.

BOS - None (May 3, 2004)
BOA - None
BOS - April 26, 2004
Re:  Large Scale Retail (aka Big Box Retail)
- This was heard by the Land Use Committee and passed out.
- For areas outside of the downtown, this legislation would require a Conditional Use for spaces of more than 50,000 square feet.  It would prohibit any use in excess of 120,000 square feet.
- In the downtown area, it would require a Conditional Use for any use larger than 90,000 square feet and prohibit any use of more than 120,000 square feet that sells groceries and other uses.
- It would also allow people to move and re-tenant when there is a large store and another similar store is moving in.
- It adds criteria for the Conditional Use for this specific usage.  It would require that the Commission consider if there is an active street frontage, a change in traffic patters, mixed use business opportunities, etc.   This will be forwarded to the full Board of Supervisors and heard on May 11, 2004.
Re:  2599 Lombard Street
- This will be heard by the full Board on Tuesday, May 11, 2004.
- This is an appeal of a Conditional Use for an antenna.

(-) Bill Petru - Discretionary Review Requestor
- He displayed a photograph taken from his bathroom window showing the proposed project overlaid on the existing building.
(-) Charles Gisaifu
- He displayed a photograph of the street face showing how the proposed house will look after construction compared to the other homes.

- He gave a PowerPoint presentation displaying drawings and photographs of how the project has been modified to accommodate actual impacts on adjacent properties.
(+) Carol Ruth Silver

(Continued from Regular Meeting of March 25, 2004)
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Tony Pantaleoni - Project Architect
- This is the first project that he has had that staff has not agreed with the soundness report.
- This fails to meet the requirements of demolition because of the soundness report.
- Preliminary plans were designed.  Then it was found out that the soundness report did not meet the current soundness guidelines.
- There are some inadequacies with the project:  The lower unit is only 448 square feet; only a one car garage; there is a need to walk through a unit to get to another unit; etc.  The kitchen and dining area is only 140 square feet.
- The building was built in 1922 as a single family unit.  The unit at the rear was added in 1954, perhaps for a relative or a son.
- The current owners use it as a sound studio.
- The bedroom/living room is a good size.  It was possibly intended as an in-law unit.
- The upper unit is 1,100 square feet but the bedrooms are very small.  The kitchen is an inadequate kitchen.
(+) Mike Rafferty - Project Sponsor
- In November 2002 he started looking at properties and decided to purchase the current property.
- After various issues regarding paperwork on this project with the Planning Department, which lasted about six months, he is just now having a hearing on it.
- He has submitted plans with the soundness reports and suddenly the rules have changed.
- He did not know that the project was going to be reviewed under a different set of rules.
(-) Cheryl Duperrault
- She questions the report on the soundness of the demolition.
- It would be a shame to allow this project to be demolished.
- The unit down below was rented out and the person who rented it out passed away.
- She feels that the repairs to the unit are cosmetic.  She feels strongly about maintaining the home since there are so many Victorian homes that have been demolished.
- She has worked hard to maintain the property.

1447 - 1449 LOMBARD STREET- south side between Van Ness Avenue and Franklin Street; Lot 104, in Assessor's Block 0503 - Request for rear yard and non-complying structure variances for the proposed conversion of office spaces to two dwelling units on the second and third floors of an existing three-story building with a full-service restaurant on the ground floor.  The proposed conversion would not alter the configuration of the existing building.   Because the existing building already encroaches into the required rear yard, it is considered a legal, non-complying structure, and the conversion of the two upper floors from commercial use to residential use triggers these variances.  The site is within an NC-3 (Neighborhood Commercial, Moderate-Scale) Zoning District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.

524 POST STREET- north side between Mason and Taylor  Streets, Lot 5, in Assessor's Block 297 - Request under Planning Code Section 309 (Downtown Code) for Determinations of Compliance and Exceptions, including an exception for a building exceeding  80 feet in a 80-130-F District for a building in a C-3-G District. The proposal is to modify plans for which a building permit has already been approved for the renovations of the existing Olympic Club building in order to increase and relocate the handball courts to the highest level of the building and add up to 4,176 feet of gross floor area, the maximum allowable amount remaining for the site.  The proposal would involve an increase in the height of the rear portion of the existing building at 524 Post Street by 12 to 27 feet to a maximum height of 113 feet, depending on the particular location, in order to have a complete sixth level across the rear of the site that would accommodate the handball courts.  The remainder of the building would be fully renovated and seismically strengthened in accordance with the existing, approved building permit, with revisions to the internal layouts to accommodate reorganization of certain spaces.

CONSIDERATION OF ADOPTION OF REVISIONS TO THE BOUNDARIES FOR SECTIONS OF THE EASTERN NEIGHBORHOODS- South of Market (generally bounded by Mission, 7th Street, Freeway 80, 4th Street, the Embarcadero, and Folsom). Public hearing on and consideration of amendments regarding the boundaries of the SOMA area excluded from the Eastern Neighborhoods EIR and Eastern Neighborhoods policies, adopted under Planning Commission Motion 16726.   The proposal is to exclude  areas west of 4th Street and east of Division Street, except the South of Market Earthquake Recovery Redevelopment Project Area from the EIR and Policies.
SPEAKER(S):
Jim Meko - SOMA Leadership Council
- The Planning Department's community planning process in SOMA was a failure.
- The SOMA community decided to move forward and do better.
- There was a compromise to draw a line down the middle of Fourth Street and it was decided to let SOMA east of that move ahead, while west of Fourth Street, with the exception of the SOMA PAC, would be removed until there could be some real comprehensive planning done.
- His highest priority is to keep Folsom Street as far east as Fourth Street in the planning process.
- Folsom is going to be the heart of the new South of Market and they will want to have a say in this.
- No one asked for Core PDR anywhere in SOMA.
- He wants a coherent community and not just the leftovers to work with.
Bob Meyers - Yerba Buena Lofts Homeowners Association
- The residents of the south side of Folsom Street and the north side of Clara request that there the two blocks between Fourth and Fifth Street remain in the housing mixed use boundaries that were approved last February and stay included in the EIR.
- He asked that the Commission approve the compromise provided by the community.
Jeffrey Liebovitz - Rincon
- He thanked Jim Meko for pulling together various community meetings.
- Everyone has worked hard for many years to reach a compromise that will benefit everyone.
- He displayed a map showing Fourth Street requesting to be inclusive of both sides of Fourth Street.
- It makes sense to include both sides of Fourth Street going north.
Ed Townsend
- He seconds the comments of Bob Meyers.
- He would like to keep the boundaries proposed by the community.
David Wilbur - SOMA PAC
- He is the most permissive of all the speakers.  He supports the decision from staff.
- To eliminate the blocks from Clementina to the bridge makes absolutely no sense.  These blocks should be included in the EIR.
- There are some small blocks on the south side of Harrison Street.   If these blocks are not looked at through this process, they will never be looked at again.
- There is some pressure being [exerted] by some very powerful Supervisors on members of Planning saying that if staff does not do what they want, they will be messing around with funding.  It is important for staff members to stand up and do the right thing.
ACTION Approved as Amended:  The parcels between Clara and Harrison and 4th and 5th Streets and the parcels between Harrison Street and Interstate 80 and 4th and 7th Streets are now excluded from the Eastern Neighborhoods environmental review process and the Eastern Neighborhood Policies.
