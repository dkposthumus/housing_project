(See below)
12.???????Status
Report on Supervisors Katz? Legislation regarding live/work.
The following report relates to both
Items 11 and 12:
- In May of 1999, the department
brought before the Commission the legislation which attempted to amend the OHPP
provisions of the planning code and convert it to the jobs housing linkage
expanding the number of activities which would be subject to affordable housing
and child care exactions.
- The BOS in January, considered the
legislation which the Commission acted upon and sought amendments of that
legislation.
- This created two different
versions of the same legislation.?Both
Supervisor Amiano and Supervisor Katz had amendments.?The only difference was with regards to the definition of office
use.??On October 19, 2000 these two
pieces of legislation will be brought to the Commission.
- The Commission will then advise
the BOS as to the appropriate language and the appropriate fees.
- There are two ballot measures
which will affect the definition of office use as well.
- Both Planning Department and City
Attorney?s Office as well as Supervisor?s Amiano and Katz?will be bringing recommendations to the Commission
with regards to consistent definition of office use and fees.
- At that time the public will be
allowed to comment.
SPEAKER(S):
John Bardis
- Will there be materials available a
week before the October 19, 2000 hearing regarding the legislation from

LIVE-WORK TO LOFT HOUSING AMENDMENT, Initiate amendments to Part II,
Chapter 11, of the San Francisco Municipal Code (Planning Code) by amending
Sections 102.7 and 102.13 to redefining "live/work" units as
"loft housing" and classifying them as residential uses; repealing
Section 233 regarding live/work; adding Section 232 to establish requirements
for loft housing that would subject it to existing live/work controls except
that there would be no restriction on the nature of work which could be
performed in the unit so long as the use is permitted in the SSO
(Service/Secondary Office) zoning district and no requirement that the
occupant(s) work in the unit, would require loft housing to comply with
inclusionary housing policies, would establish and in-lieu payment for
affordable housing requirements in the 40/85 foot height district contained
wholly within the South of Market Residential Service District (RSD), would
require loft housing in residential areas to comply with all requirements for
residential uses including the residential design guidelines, would require
loft housing constructed in areas not zoned residential to comply with all
requirements for residential uses except for height, front setback and open
space requirements, would prohibit existing live/work units from being used or converted
to office space, and establishes minimum dwelling unit air and light exposure
standard; states that this ordinance supersedes any inconsistent Planning
Commission policies.
Preliminary Recommendation:Initiate
SPEAKER(S);
(-) Carlos Romero
- He would like to address the
affordable litigation aspect of it.
- There is a portion within the
legislation which discusses a switching of the 10% construction of affordable
housing in the development to a $50 per sf fee.?This would be about $100 less than what is going to cost the
live/work developers.?This legislation
deprives the City of San Francisco $100 of impact mitigation per square foot.
- This part should be stricken.
- He believes the legislation is
flawed.?Supervisor Leno?s legislation
is much more appropriate to what the City of San Francisco really needs.
(neutral) Sue Hestor
- She would like to have
Supervisor?s Leno?s legislation come before Supervisor?s Katz? legislation.
- Why is one piece of legislation on
the same subject moving and the other is not?
- The procedural issues should be
addressed as well.
(+) Alice Barkley
- She urges the Commission to
initiate the legislation as proposed.
- If the Commission does not
initiate this legislation there will be a huge gap.
- This needs to be done before the
interim controls end.
Eric Quesada - Mission
Anti-Displacement Coalition
- He is wondering why the two
legislations are not being presented together.
- How will this be moved forward

building.

Preliminary Recommendation: Uphold Negative Declaration
SPEAKER(S):
(neutral) Stephen Johns
-He
lives about 2 blocks away from the golf course.
- He would like to request an opportunity to study and
discuss and address the specific issues related to the proposal.?He feels he is being denied this opportunityif the Commission upholds the negative declaration.
- His neighborhood will greatly be impacted by traffic and herbicide
which will be sprayed at the golf course.
- An EIR would allow everyone an opportunity to study and
find out what is going on and address issues accordingly.
- Please do not issue a negative declaration on this
project.
(-) Adena Rosemerin - one of the appellants
- The first step of this project, the broadcast application
of roundup, is prohibited by the City?s IPM ordinance.?Palmer has applied for an exception, but it
has not been granted.?Therefore the
first step of this project is either illegal or non-existent.?The PND cannot be adopted.
- If there is substantial evidence in light of the whole
record before the lead agency that the project may have a significant affect on
the environment, an EIR should be prepared.
- The construction date has been moved from this fall to
next spring.?This change will likely
result in earth moving and other heavy construction during the nesting season.
- Red-Legged Frogs are a federally-protected species and
there are documented occurrences of these frogs.
(-) Daniel Murphy - Golden Gate Audubon Society
- Their first concern is with tree cutting since it will
affect nesting birds.?Tree cutting
should not occur during February and July.
- The night lighting will impact migratory birds which four
species are federally listed.
- There are a number of endangered species.
- This project needs much more study.
(-) Did not state name
- The Lake Merced watershed is a crucial resource for San
Francisco, there are endangered species involved and there are impacts on the
human environment as well.
(+) Phil Havnacheck - Board Member of Harding Club Men?s
Club
- He supports the project as well as many other community
organizations.
- The lighting issue is not as significant.?It?s a small driving range which will be lit
and not the whole golf course.
(+) Lou Perrone - President of the Harding Park Golf Club
- The board and the majority of the members of the club
support the Negative Declaration.
- He believes that there has been extensive studies done and
there will be no damage to the environment.?It will actually be a first step to renovate the Lake Merced area.
(+) Mike Blankinship - Arnold Palmer Golf
- He supports the Negative Declaration
(+) Chris Hamill - Arnold Palmer Golf
- He declines comment.
(+) Dan McKenna - Rec and Park Department
- This issues has been thoroughly discussed at the Rec and
Park Department.
- Regarding the pesticides, danger to the environment will
be addressed through a resource management plan.
- Light on the driving range will not affect migratory
birds.?They are looking into curtailing
the lights in the evening especially during seasons that may be more sensitive
to migratory birds.

the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.?With respect to agenda items, your
opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached
in the meeting with one exception.?When
the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members

hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during
the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.?Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three
minutes.?If it is demonstrated that

Re: Touchless Car Wash
-?She has been instructed to read a letter from the neighbors of the

Wash have created new plans which were submitted without notifying them.

Rules and Regulations by altering the location of the?Public Comment category of their Regular Meeting agenda to allow
for a more efficient use of the public?s time and participation.
(Continued from Regular Meeting of
October 12, 2000)
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Norman Roff
- He would like to state the fact
that the Municipal Transportation Agency, The Public Utilities Commission and
Parking and Traffic Commission all hold Public Comment at the beginning.
- Because of the fact that the
meetings of the Planning Commission go for such a long time,?and one can never estimate when an item will
go on, it is only fair that the Commission allow people to speak at the
beginning of the meeting.
- DBI has two Public Comment periods
and the Commission can adopt this system.?If not then Public Comment should be made at a specific time.
(-) Joe Luttrell - Telegraph Hill
Neighborhood Dwellers
- The Commissioners have one of the
toughest jobs in city government.
- One of the good things about
having Public Comment at the beginning, everyone is still fresh since the meeting
has just started.
- The other option would be to have
Public Comment at a specific time.?That
way, people can arrive for a specific time.
(-) Steve Williams
- He opposes the rule change.
- Public Comment serves an education
purpose for the Commission.
- The Commission really depends on
Public Comment.
- The Rules should encourage public
participation.
- To have public comment at the end
of the meeting would encourage people not to come to speak.
(-) Aurora Grajeda
- Would like to thank the Commission
for approving the project at 2500 Market Street.
- The Commission?s responsibility is
to the public.?The Commission should
also have the best interest of the public.
- Many people will not be able to
come to the meetings if Public Comment is changed.
(-) Eric Quezada - MAC
- The public had to endure years of
struggle to try to get the Commission to understand what live/work is all
about, they had to endure the lies about dot.coms--that offices weren?t
offices, double standards on how developers are treated and how community
members are treated, endure hate letters and threatening phone calls because
they stepped forward.?There was never
any conversation with anyone to say how can this situation be made better.
(-) Jose Morales - Senior Housing
Action Collaborative
- Moving Public Comment to the end
of the meeting would cause a great problem for seniors.
- Please pay attention to the public
and do not make arrangements without consulting the public.
(-) Antonio Diaz - PODER and MAC
- He doesn?t approve of the rule
change.
- By moving Public Comment to the
end of the hearing, it would shut people?s mouths and the public would not be
able to have their voices heard.
- A few months ago, he and other
people had to wait for many hours before they were able to speak.
(+) Jeffrey Heller - Heller/Manus
Architects
- Public Comment at the end of the
meeting would enable people to come to the meetings and not necessarily have to
miss time from work.?This would give an
opportunity for people?s voices to be heard.
- Public Comment is only for items
not on the calendar.
- The public is more hurt by having
Public Comment at the beginning.
(-) Mary Ann Miller - San Francisco
Tomorrow and SPEAK
- She has been coming to the
Commission for many years.
- Public Comment provides
opportunity for the public to bring to the Commission and the Planning
Department items and concerns that they might not be aware of.
- Keep the 1:30 time for 15
minutes.?Then add some time a few
minutes before the end of the meeting for additional public comment.
- Put Public Comment at the
beginning and at the end of the meeting.
(-) Dick Millet - Potrero Boosters
- Everyone has spoken quite
eloquently.
- This would be a bad move for the
Commission since they need the public relations.
(-) Rob Eshelman - Tenant Organizer
with the Housing Rights of San Francisco and member of MAC
- Every decision that this
Commission make is +7-0 in favor of development.
- It is really bad to make senior
folks, disabled folks, and families wait around until 9:00 p.m to comment on
issues that affect their neighborhoods.
(-) Christian Parenti - MAC
- He is a Mission District resident.
- He opposes the changes.
- The real issue is that the
Commission fears democracy.
- It would be best to just eliminate
public comment.
(-) Jeannene Przyblyski -
Collingwood HillNeighborhood
Association
- She has concerns about monster
homes in neighborhoods in San Francisco
- Please leave the Public Comment at
the beginning of Commission meetings.
- This proposal is not regarded as
an attempt to facilitate people?s access to the Commission.
(-) Bill Wilson
- Have two public comments at each
hearing that would make it more convenient for people.
- There are people that are coming
to the Commission to let?Commissioners
know that their lives are changing.
- It is important that Public
Comment be left where it is.
(-) Christine Linnenbach
- Submitted a Press Release from the
Seniors and Veterans for Integrity in Government.
- People who are senior citizens
have to take public transportation, if public comment was moved to the end of
the hearing, they would either have to go home late on public transportation or
not be able to attend at all.
- These are public hearings and
public participation requires a process where people can participate.
- Please stop fighting, people want
to work with the city.?This idea of
changing Public Comment is offensive.
- People from district 7 and all
over the City have concerns about these changes.
- She has done statistical research
on Planning Commission meetings and there is no evidence for this change to be
granted.
(-) John Bardis - Inner Sunset
Action Committee and Coalition for San Francisco Neighborhoods
- The Coalition of San Francisco
Neighborhoods voted unanimously to urge the planning Commission to leave public
comment where it is.?Fifteen minutes is
not an unpredictable amount.
- If public comment is ruining the
agenda, the Commission should talk to staff and talk to developers.
- If other commissions have Public
Comment at the end, that?s because their meetings run for a maximum of 2 hours.
(-) Chris Daly - MAC
- After mobilizing several hundred
people here--like community members of the Mission, neighbors of Bryant Square
Project, and other supporters of the Mission District--testifying for several
hours which the Commission then later approved the project +7-0 with no changes
to the project and not having heard what they said, makes them wonder if the
Commission is really listening.
- They protested the Macromedia
project and yet the Commission voted again for the project without even a
discussion.
- They feel that they are under
attack over and over again.
- The actions by Commissioner
Theoharis, after removing Jonathan Yutes from the podium, requires her
resignation as appointed Commissioner.
(-) Patricia Vaughey
- Someone who represents people that
are homeless and people that are very wealthy can meet in a room and compromise
on issues provided you give them the chance to vote and to have their voices
heard.
- Having public comment two times
during the hearing is a good idea.
- San Francisco has always been
known for allowing people to speak.
(-) Andrew Wood - MAC
- No matter what the time Public Comment
is, they will be here.
- They will not let the Commission
do things within closed doors or in the dark.
(-) Bud Wilson - West of Twin Peaks
Area
- Back in the mid-80's, public
testimony was at the end of the hearings and later it was moved to the beginning
of the hearing -- there must have been a good reason for this.
- If Public Comment is moved to the
end, there will be few people exercising their rights, particularly senior
people.
- Maybe the Commission should
consider having Public Comment two times during the hearing.
(-) Quintin Mecke - South of Market
Anti-Displacement
- Even though their organization has
the word Aanti@ in their name, they are pro-community.
- It?s ironic that Mr. Heller would say
that it would make it more democratic to wait until 8 or 9 p.m. so more people
would show up.
- Democracy is not something that
would be associated with the Commission.
- Two opportunities to speak would
be a good idea.
(-) Lisa Russ - South of Market Anti-Displacement
- They are a group of residents,
businesses, artists, and non-profits who are coming together in the South of
Market who have come together to create a voice and create community-oriented
planning and to fight the displacement that is happening in the community.
- Whatever it takes, they will be
hear to speak during public comment.
- She supports the idea of having
two public comments.
(-) Judy West
- She is against moving public
comment to the end of the agenda.
- She understand the concerns that
the Commissioners have.
- To change the way business is
conducted, because of certain instances which have occurred on certain days, is
not good.
(-) Joe Butler - Architect
- He is more often here as pro-bono
than as a lobbyist for neighbors.
- Public Comment is an effective way
to expeditiously bring matters to the attention of the Commission.
- The order of business is currently
quite accurate.
(-) Heather Rogers
- Resident of the Mission District
and a member of MAC.
- The Planning Department should
make things easier for the public to comment and have it two times -- one at
1:30 and one at 5:30 p.m.
(-) Terry Milne - Bernal Heights
- He has been coming to the hearings
for about 20 years.
- It is easier for him and his
neighbors to leave public comment where it is now.
- He has been educated by hearing
people?s comments during Public Comment.
- If there is a group that needs to
come down, it is easier to schedule a bunch of people at one time like 1:30
p.m.
(-) David Paul Grace
- In a real democracy, everyone has
a voice and time for deliberation.
- We can?t make complicated
decisions without public input.
- He advocates the proposal of
having two times.
- He would also like for people to
be able to call during the hearings and state their opinions.
(-) Sue Hestor
- She has been attending Planning
Commission meetings even before public comment was introduced.?Public Comment was a reform measure to open
things up for the public.
- She sat during the discussion when
the Commission moved Public Comment from the end of the calendar to the
beginning of the calendar.
- It?s strange to her that all of a
sudden there is a rule change.
- It is the responsibility of the
chairperson to manage the meeting smoothly.
(+) Alice Barkley
- With the hearings televised, what
the opposition has done is play election politics.
- She supports moving public comment
to the end of the hearing.
- This Commission has never ignored
public comment.
(+) Joe O?Donaghue - Residential
Builders
- He is a political groupie.
- Most of the people who have spoken
today are political groupies.?These
groupies are the ones who generally speak during Public Comment.
- We are not talking about limiting
the public to speak.
- He would like a specific time to
have public comment at the end.
(-) Jim Rodriguez
- He is not a political
groupie.?This is the first time that he
has come to one of the meetings.
- Why are people so confused about
having Public Comment at the beginning or the end since the Commission doesn?t
pay attention anyway?

Re:?1552 Polk Street/Blockbuster Video- The Commission voted to take DR.?While he was waiting for this case to come
up, it came to his attention that the video legislation had passed which
requires video stores to acquire a conditional use permit.?Therefore, the Board of Appeals did not have
jurisdiction.?If the owner wants to
continue with the project, he will consult the District Attorney and recommend
for the owner to apply for a conditional use permit.
Re: 415 Bryant Street- This was an Appeal of a Negative

appropriate.

Sue Hestor
- She was listening for the words of
office and multimedia and these words were not mentioned by Mr. Green.
- She displayed maps of areas where
there are live/works, offices, etc.
Alice Barkley
- Between now and election there should
be no effort by staff to redefine dot.coms.
- Interim Controls have a definite
time out of state law.
- Proposition L, requires that the
Commission finish it?s work by June of 2001.
- Look at some of the areas in the
City that should be industrial and only that.
- Release some of the areas that
have gone through tremendous transition.
- This Commission should take bold
steps to make housing available quick since this City cannot wait.
Joe O?Donaghue
- Instead of looking for affordable
housing, the term needs to be changed to low-cost?housing which can only come by allowing increased densities.
- District elections have defined
that they will be the predominant influence in city politics for generations to
come.
- Increased densities can only come
in the South of Market and the Bay View areas.
John Bardis
- The increase density has been the
policy of this City for the past half century.
- This density should have come from
the residential areas of the City.
- They would love to have Mr.
O?Donaghue build all the residential housing he wishes.
- It?s a disgrace what has been done
to sites that could have invited housing in this City.

SPEAKER(S):
Calvin Welsh - Council of the
Community Housing Organizations
- The report given by the Director
is factually incorrect.
- This ordinance is not the
ordinance passed in 1999.?It has been amended
substantially and significantly amended in a matter that would actually reduce
the number of affordable units developed under a certain scenario.
Brother Kelly Cullen - Tenderloin
Neighborhood Development Corporation
- This is a very important piece of
policy and legislation.
- He has the same concerns as the
previous speaker.?As well as cutting
the fee for people who donate land.?Many times people want to donate the money directly to the TNDC instead
of going through the Planning Department and the Mayor?s Office of Housing.
- Doing deals with the department?s
own choice of housing developers could cause a lot of problems including people
possibly setting up their own housing development corporations to really go
around the department.

- Board of Supervisors had to do is
to consolidate the appeal period with the Conditional Use hearing if it is
appeal, if the Conditional Use hearing is not appeal, then the Board of
Supervisors, simple dismissed the appeal, because they won?t have jurisdiction.
