a place to live.?When their babies are
born (twins) his mother will also come to live with them.
- They will not be
taking any additional space.
- Since their project
is in the ?pipe line? he would like for his project to be exempt from
Discretionary Review.
- He was shocked to
find out that this policy would be voted on at the Commission.
(-) Michael Vanni
- He and his wife
started a project to merge units since more family members will be moving in.
- They are almost half
way through the project and have spent thousands of dollars.
- Now they become aware
that this policy will be voted on at the Commission.
- Since he started his
project in February of this year and many permits have been issued, he believes
that this is unfair since he would have to go through Discretionary Review.
(-) Tamsin Randlett
- She and her husband
bought?property which is going through
the ?pipeline? right now.
- They have spend a lot
of money and have had to borrow in order to pay for their merger project.
- They are not changing
the footprint of the project.
- They would like have
project s that are in the ?pipeline? be exempt from this policy.
(-) Erin Day
- She and her husband
own a property.
- Her project is in the
?pipe line? as well.
- In August of this
year, they applied for a dwelling merger, what through all the paperwork and
now become aware of this policy which would cause problems to their project.
- Although she is
sympathetic to the reason for this policy, she doesn?t believe that projects
which have been started should have to go through Discretionary Reviews.
- This policy will
cause a tremendous burden to them.
(-) Erin Oberly
- She is glad she
doesn?t have a project at the Planning Department right now.
- Yet, she is
sympathetic to the people who have spoken previously which will be affected by
this policy.
- This policy will
cause a tremendous burden on small property owners who wish to expand because
their families are growing and instead of buying a bigger house (because they
can?t afford it) would rather expand their homes and merge dwelling units for
more space.
- Large properties
and/or projects should go through
(-) Robert Celso
- He received an e-mail
today of someone who told him about this meeting.?He wishes he would have had more time to prepare.
- He does not agree
with this policy since the Commission is so interested in not loosing rentals
that they are not taking into consideration the families who own small
properties and need to expand since their families are growing.
(-) Will Sprietsma
- He owns a small
property
- There are no tenants
involved.
- He has been saving
money to make this property into a single-family home.
- Right now, he has to
go outside to get to the other part of the house.
- There are no tenants
involved so he doesn?t think it?s fair that he would have to go through
Discretionary Reviews.
(-) Jim Fabris
- He is opposed to this
policy.
- A legal dwelling unit
is removed when two units are merged.?A
long time ago, many of the multiple unit properties were single-family homes
yet they started splitting.?Now because
society is changing, many of these properties are becoming single-family homes.
- This policy is
inappropriate.
(-) Siesel Maibach
- She will not repeat
what everyone has said, but is in opposition to this policy.
- Her plans for her
project have been in the Planning Department for many months now.
(-) Donald Gibbs
- He grew up in the
Mission District and had to leave the City he loves because he can?t afford it.
- Now he has moved back
and has a project which will merge units.
- He would like to have
a second bedroom in his 1 bedroom unit.
- He objects to the
design review since it?s an erosion of property rights.
- The department needs
to be more creative in finding a solution.
(-) Robert Rosenbaum
- He lives in a unit
which was converted.
- He is not trying to
merge units yet is sympathetic to the speakers who have merger projects.
- In the future he
might want to merge units and thinks it?s not fair to have to go through
Discretionary Review.
(-) David Grossman
- He has a 2 unit
building.
- He learned that his
tenants are moving out of state.
- He is starting a
family and would like to merge the units since there will be no evictions.
- He echoes the sympathy
what the Department is trying to do yet his hear goes out to the people who
have dwelling merger projects.
(-) Ted Loewenberg
- He heard about this
policy through the Small Property Owners Organization.
- He pays mortgage,
taxes, repair costs, etc to his own property and now the Department is telling
him what he?has to do with his
property.
- He finds it unfair
that there is a recommendation to adopt the policy after public speakers.?In any court, the public has a right to
speak and then a vote is conducted.?Input should be considered first and not just make decisions by what the
Director has recommended.
(-) Mary Lis
- She owns a property
which is going through the Planning Department right now.
- She and her husband
have a daughter and are expecting another baby.?So, they would like to expand their home.
- If this policy is
passed they will not be able to merge their 2 units into 1.
(-) Elizabeth Airheart
- She is an attorney
and she is representing a family who has a project right now in the Planning
Department.
- She would like to
request that these type of project should be exempt from this policy.
(-) Joe O?Donahue
- He recommends that
this policy should be continued and brought to the attention of the Board of
Supervisors.
- This policy is an
intrusion on people rights.
- This policy is also
forcing people buy properties with more than one unit and spend money on
merging these units.
- He also recommends
that properties that have started projects to have them continue and go through
the process.
(-) John (last name
unclear)
- He is here for
another matter but decided to speak because his property was never approved as
a single-family home, yet the two units house 1 family.
- Having units merged
would create less parking problems.

- Submitted
Resolution No. 13794, adopted on December 15, 1994.?This is a policy for this site which has never been repealed.

discussion of compatibility with policies belongs in this negative declaration.
- She has
two issues: a) it?s going to be offices b) policies are not discussed.
(-) Judy
West
- This site
has a major crossroad to the neighborhood.
- She
passed documents to the Commissioners.

culturally significant site which needs to be addressed further.

toxic chemicals at the site that is why an Environmental Impact Report is
required.

lived in the area for many years and has seen the cement factory when it was
open.

resident and a member of Project Artaud.

here on behalf of MAC (Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition).

City.?This is been proven to not be
true.
- Will the
land use have any substantial impact on the existing character of the vicinity.

times will the Commission tell the public that the Planning policies are not

a soil management plan in place which has been approved by the Department of
Public Health.?There will be a health

considered IPZs.?Projects in this area
will be ?grandfathered?.

allegations that this project will displace.?The site has been vacant for 8 years.

- Referred
to an article on the New York Times regarding artists? vs. dot.coms.

like the Commission to review the conditions of approval.
(-) Judy
West
- This is a
very crucial site for the neighborhood and she would like for the Commission to
be very careful to not do the wrong thing.
- To say
that this project is exempt from any policies to discourage housing is very
disingenuous on the part of the Commission.
- She would
really like to see built a very large public plaza -- like a European
plaza.?Not something that will compete
with Franklin Square but more like something that would be more urban, for the
business community, for carnaval, for farmer?s markets.
- This is
one of the only sites left in our industrial land that could be something for
the public.
(-) Trisha

is a gateway to the Mission.
(-) Steven
Siegel
- The
proposed development will only aggravate matters more.
- The need
for affordable and performing space is imperative.
- Artists
are being forced to leave areas which they have helped create.
- Venues
are being forced to increase their fees which makes it difficult for artists to
rent and/or perform there.
(-) Sue
Hestor
- There are
important items which are not dealt with in the staff report.
- The
Commission has never dealt with repealing the resolution.
(+) Alice
Barkley
- The

barking dogs.
- The code

- This
live/work project meets all the requirements.
- Regarding
parking and traffic and the concern of the neighbors, it was suggested to
eliminate commercial spaces, put the parking garage from Alabama Street down to
the commercial level.?The only problem
is that this would be a conflict of policies.
- The project
team came to a conclusion and this is what is being presented to the
Commission.
