there a guarantee that all residents are going to have a background check.?(-)

Opposed program, people who recommend approval of this program, do not
live there.Reason why people do

they relocate.(-)

COMMENTS:Gerald
G. Green - Director of Planning,unfortunately
there is so much misunderstanding about what is going on the premises,
also it is unfortunate that the Project Sponsor, while they were contacted
and notified before they started that they needed to have this conditional
use authorization.Might represent
that as a demonstration a significant need for thistype of activity.When
this item was before you, as a 24 bed facility, we didn=t
dispute that there is not a need for a facility of this nature, especially
a facility in a residential setting.A
24 bed facility also required a variance.This
is too large of an operation for this specific site.As
part of a continuance, we intended to work with project sponsor to see
if there were other alternatives.That
information was not provided to us until just recently.They
preferred rather than 24, they could live with 18 beds.It
is possible that this facility could accommodate 12 possibly up to 18,
but doing so, we=d
asked the Commission to restore this property back to some resemblance
to what it was before.There should
be off-street parking.Our
initial recommendation was based upon a facility for 24 beds.We
do not support 24.Can support a
facility up to 18 with conditions, that the parking be restored, and there
be no consideration for variance.Anita
Theoharis, Commission President,to
the neighbors who do not want any facility, they must know, that the City
is in a great need for group housing.Group
housings should and will be located in all neighborhoods.I
am supportive of this facility being in the neighborhood, but can=t
support more than 13 residents because then we won=t
have the proper balance between the R-2 neighbor and the group housing
facility.

G. Green - Director of Planning,unfortunately
there is so much misunderstanding about what is going on the premises,
also it is unfortunate that the Project Sponsor, while they were contacted
and notified before they started that they needed to have this conditional
use authorization.Might represent
that as a demonstration a significant need for thistype of activity.When
this item was before you, as a 24 bed facility, we didn=t
dispute that there is not a need for a facility of this nature, especially
a facility in a residential setting.A
24 bed facility also required a variance.This
is too large of an operation for this specific site.As
part of a continuance, we intended to work with project sponsor to see
if there were other alternatives.That
information was not provided to us until just recently.They
preferred rather than 24, they could live with 18 beds.It
is possible that this facility could accommodate 12 possibly up to 18,
but doing so, we=d
asked the Commission to restore this property back to some resemblance
to what it was before.There should
be off-street parking.Our
initial recommendation was based upon a facility for 24 beds.We
do not support 24.Can support a
facility up to 18 with conditions, that the parking be restored, and there
be no consideration for variance.Anita
Theoharis, Commission President,to
the neighbors who do not want any facility, they must know, that the City
is in a great need for group housing.Group
housings should and will be located in all neighborhoods.I
am supportive of this facility being in the neighborhood, but can=t
support more than 13 residents because then we won=t
have the proper balance between the R-2 neighbor and the group housing
facility.
