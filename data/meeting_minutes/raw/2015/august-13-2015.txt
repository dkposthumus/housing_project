Commissioner Moore:
There was an article in yesterday's paper, you may or may not have see it, which spoke about starter homes, something, which I assume over the years, we all heard about, and the article analyzed the fact that the building industry does not anticipate building any starter homes any longer, because it just doesn’t seems to be penciling out. I found that as a rather sobering statement, sobering to the extent that we're pondering housing, affordable housing, and in the past, historically starter homes used to be the first entry of families and children into owning a first home of their own, but with that building type not being buildable anymore for all of the reasons that I assume we're aware of, I just want you to make a note that we should be thinking about that as we move forward and answer other housing questions.
Commissioner Antonini:
A couple of things first of all, I received today, the comments and responses on 5M, and I spoke to Vice-Chair Wu and I also understanding is, it has been released for the public and I just want to make sure that we are clear that is available to the public and anyone who wants it should avail themselves, because we frequently have complaints of not having materials, well this is over a month to be able to review the comments and responses on 5M because our final action is now scheduled for September 17th, so I am just making it clear that for the record, this is one that was really unlessthere's anything that I'm missing. So that was my first comment, my second comment I did ask, I don’t know if secretary was able to send it today, it was sent to all the Commissioners, and it is very interesting, annual survey of the Bay Area by the Bay Area Council and I was invite as guest last Tuesday when they met and part of it was the findings of the survey which was done by EMC Research a very good survey. First of all, a thousand respondents distribution by counties almost exactly according to population, income levels very accurate and various incomes represented, ethnically very well balanced, so I think, is well formulated survey, and they asked what was the most important or pressing issue we had, and it dealt with the drought, but it was more specific and more proactive it said, fixing our water infrastructure and so that was you know more than just saying you take shorter showers or don't get water at restaurants, is really let’s do something, so we have a supply that it is around for those years when there is a lack of rain. So anyway, the vast - - the highest percentage said that and second place was the cost of living, and shortly behind that housing, so those are the things that are on people's minds a lot, and then came traffic, crime and homelessness in thatorder. It was a good survey also because 60 percent of respondents have been living in the Bay Area twenty years or more, so you did have a lot of people, who may have come from somewhere else, and also didn’t have the perspective from one year to the next. And a couple of the things that people agreed with in high-level 66 percent said they would like to see a reduction of fees and other things if it meant moving housing through faster and also by a high percentage like 55 percent said they like to see modification of CEQA to expedite these things while we are still protecting the environment. I think it was an interesting survey and one the most interesting things, is a map and more to it than that they asked people where is new housing the most needed, and I think, 75 or 80 percent of the entire Bay Area which represented 85 percent of the population outside of San Francisco, 15 percent identified San Francisco as the place where the housing was the most needed, so it is clear that people want to live in San Francisco, have family members who want to live here, and they understand the need that we build more housing asked housing of all income levels, it was not necessarily affordable housing, it was housing of all income levels. It is pretty clear there is a lot of support for building more housing and hopefully we can continue to do that.
Commissioner Wu:
Ms. Jones, if you could comment on the 5M comments and responses.
Sarah Jones, Acting Planning Director:
Good afternoon, Sarah Jones, acting Planning Director and also Environmental Review Officer, we had been on track to publish the response to comments on 5M for the original hearing date of September 3rd, when it was continued - - one of the reasons for the continuance of that hearing was to give Commissioners and the public adequate time to take in the information, so we felt that it would be appropriate to publish on the original schedule and just have that information out there and available for a longer period of time than mandated.
Commissioner Richards:
Couple of points, first to the survey that Commissioner Antonini referenced, I really want kind of frame the issue in this, let's reduce fees and just build more housing, when we build houses we have issues that we created as a result of that, we certainly do increase supply, but we do increase infrastructure demand as well as demand for affordable housing, and our nexus study certainly bear that for us to charge the fees that we do, some people own call them tax, but I call them fees because these actually go to mitigate the actual cost of the issue. So, this whole issue of let’s just build more housing and everything will be better, is a real fallacy, and I really want to make to drive that point to a lot of people, they tend to boil the argument down to a very simple – like bite size chunks, but it is very complicated issue, we're trying to create a whole city here, whole cities has – we have a ten elements in our the general plan, all have to work in concert with each other, you can't focus on one item housing and pump it threw and build it up, and cause issues likes we are seeing in the Eastern Neighborhoods around the infrastructure and some of the other areas in affordable housing so I want to keep reminding people about that. Secondly, I thought I'd seen it all until yesterday, when I saw in my own neighborhood a one bedroom apartment was listed for $6,500, it’s a 931 sq. ft. apartment at 435 Duboce Street, that $7 sq. ft. I think it sets the record, there only other three other apartment in the entire City that are renting at the level, I like any neighborhood but I don’t is worth that much money, but if that’s the new normal, we are in trouble.
D.DEPARTMENT MATTERS

Sarah Jones, Acting Planning Director:

BOARD OF APPEALS:
Board of Appeals did met last night, I think, one item that would be of interest to the Commission is 101 Hyde Street, was an appeal of your Section 309 determination of compliance for the project that is just few blocks away here, Hyde and Golden Gate. There is also subsequently an appeal on the variance decision that I issued, but that was the appeal at a later date that will be heard in September. At the hearing last night, the Board unanimously upheld this Commission’s decision to approve Section 309 review for that project, and that's all I have to report.
