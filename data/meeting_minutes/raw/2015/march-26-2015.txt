Commissioner Antonini:
A couple of items, I just wanted to ask about, I noticed our advanced calendar the short-term rentals for next week is being continued indefinitely.I just wanted to know, I know there are some bills before the Board of Supervisors, but I'm wondering if we'll get a chance to express our opinions on this before there is a Supervisor’s vote, I'd assume.The other item I wanted to bring up, I think we'll hear about this a little bit more when we hear about the Permit Appeals, but there was a reversal of a position that we took at theBoard ofPermit Appeals last night, I think,on 1784 Sanchez and it wassort of shocking to me. We'll get more details, because we approved it 6 to 1 and it sounds like the couplestruggled for many years with this project,but I want to hearmore about that one.
7.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Good afternoon, Commissioners, just one announcement. I want to give you an update on the short-term rental activity, you'll hear from Mr. Starr today about the proposed legislation that was introduced this week, but as of yesterday there - we have had almost 400 applications for registration, we've granted registration for about 120 and we have scheduled appointments for another 360 applications. We're getting about 30 phone calls a day for applications. We are also, for the public's benefit we're scheduling more time slots. We are getting more efficient on our timing being able to squeeze in more applications in our timeframe, so that the public knows if you call for an application you should be able to get an application appointment within about a month or so, and that concludes my presentation for today.

HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:
No Report
BOARD OF APPEALS:
The Board of Appeals did meet last night, three items that I’d like to report on. First, 340 Bryant which was an office allocation that this Commission had granted was appealed to the Board of Appeals, as you heard there is also a CEQA appeal on that matter. The CEQA appeal has been continue, so the Board continued the appeal on the office allocation to April 8th. The next item is 1784 Sanchez, which this was actually the third hearing on this item at the Board of Appeals. I reported after the previous two hearings that the Board had serious concerns about the project, its impact on the adjacent property, which is the property of the appellants. They did not find that the full extent of the variance was justified. There was a variance for a rear yard encroachment at two levels, at the ground level and the second story. They had given us direction to work with the parties to look at alternatives that would include shifting that second story further forward, getting it more out of the rear yard and having less of an impact on the neighbors. There was ultimately a resolution after we had two meetings, we met the first time for about an hour and half with the parties and the second time this week, for about two hours with the parties trying to look at different alternatives and there was something that was proposed by the appellants which the permit holder accepted and it was not their preference, but it does allows for similar amount of development, it just shifts that second story further forward. There had beenconcerns expressed by the permit holder, that it would not be somethingthey could afford, both parties, the appellants and the permit holder have engineers that were advising on this, both gave maybe conflicting argumentabout the costs, but in the proposal that was put forwarded by the appellant, it does shift it forwardand it builds over existingbearing wall, and it said, itwas thought bythe appellants engineer to be somewhat moreaffordable than what was previously proposed, and the Board accepted this agreement last night, grantedthe appeal and accepted the revised plans. The other item that was heard last night was 2825 Lake Street, which was also a variance and a discretionary review that we heard back in June. You had taken DR on the addition at the rear above a garage and have left others matters to me to decide as part of the variance, so I did grant the rear yard variance for encroachment in the rear yard at the first, second, third levels of the main building. It was reduced from what this commission had seen, but it did not fully address the concerns of the neighbors and they filed an appeal on the variance, so last night was just an appeal on the variance. One of the findings that we had in granting the variance was that the building was a historic resource, it was in a potential historical district, The Seacliff, the potential historic district, and the Board had trouble, I think they had concerns, about using that as a finding for justifying the variance. There was a motion to deny and to grant the appeal and deny the variance, that failed and there was not subsequent motion so the variance was uphold by matter of law, so that was the result on that.I am available for any questions.
