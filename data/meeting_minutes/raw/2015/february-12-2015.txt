B.COMMISSION MATTERS
5.Commission Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements.Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Antonini:
They must be extremely important for superseding our hearing. A few items, number one I was really embarrassed by what we learned in the news. Paul McGinley, who was the Captain the European Ryder Cup Team is here in the Bay Area to take part in the AT&T Tournament, decided to stop at beautiful Ocean Beach, on a beautiful day, park his car for probably no more than an hour or two, walk up Ocean Beach to the Cliff House or somewhere to have lunch. Came back to his car broken into and all his clubs were stolen, so, instead of practicing, he’s spending all day yesterday getting new clubs. He was gracious enough to say, it could have happened anywhere, but I mean, I think this is a major problem in San Francisco, and the Land Use part of it is reasons why families move to other areas and a lot of it has to do with crime and perception of crime and, you know, it’s one thing, but the penalties, from what I understand, are very lenient on people. Car thieves get ten days, if they’re convicted, and that’s what one of the Captains at one of the stations told me, which is just totally ridiculous. Boosters even probably get less, so there’s no reason not to break into cars in daylight, even if you’re caught they’re not going to do anything. So, that’s a big problem and if we’re wondering why we’re losing middle class families, that’s a big reason. Another issue, Prop M, thank you very much to Corey Teague for the memo we got, it’s not a calendared item, but I did want to ask some questions to be responded to by staff or by Corey in the future. The first is, I wanted to find out if there was any idea if we’re going to get any kind of an opinion from the City Attorney’s office among some parts of the Office Annual Limit that are under discussion, particularly the subtracting of the amounts that have been converted to non-office use. Can we add those back? Because they are not an office use anymore. The other has to do with demolitions, where a building is demolished, and the new building you have to take out the whole amount of the new building and not subtracting the amount of the demolished commercial office space, anyway, I just need to get an opinion on those two things. Thirdly, a little trouble parking again today, I was lucky I got a space. The Garage has been terrible ever since PUC, because many of the spaces there are now allocated for PUC. It’s the fiction that we deal with all the time in San Francisco, if you don’t build parking people won’t have cars. People from PUC have plenty of cars, they park in the Garage, because they don’t have any parking in their building. They should have put parking in there, now the impact is on all of us in City Hall, all of us in the Court House, which are, you know, not being able to park or having a difficult time parking there because of our lack of planning. Finally, I visited Summit 800 I think it’s called or Summit 80, it’s the development on Brother and I went in and toured some of their units, and I was very impressed at what they did. But, just to give you an idea of the costs that are involved the units there are from just under a million dollars up to around two million or more and there are a variety, but all of them are very nicely designed probably around, with a minimum of 1300 or 1400 square feet and up, all of them have a master bedroom at least on a different level. They are all two level units, even the condo units and they have two car parking for each one, and most of them have two and a half baths with all the sleeping units on the upper floor, you have choices of condos where you share the garage with somebody or you have townhouses, which are just row houses stacked on top of each other and then single-family homes, which I assume are somewhat detached, but the reason I bring this out, is you have to be kind of realistic when you look at projects and people keep saying you got to build it for less, you’ve got to price it lower, with the economy of scale you’ve got on a project that big, they’re probably selling these things as low as you possibly can because they are able to build many numbers of these and you can do it for less when you’re doing a lot of them. If you’re doing a project with one or two units you can understand how much more expensive this is, if you can’t spread the cost over a number of units. But, I was happy to see that it does again to address some of our shortages for homes acceptable for families that have enough space with adequate parking hopefully, I think they have a big demand and continue to build all the rest of them.
Commissioner Johnson:
Thank you very much, so, just for the, I was reviewing the EIR for 1546 Market Street and 1564 Market Street and just really quickly, one of the things that I thought was really awesome, is that there is a map that showed the project area, as well as, all MUNI or other public transit stops within a half a mile radius. And I know that this is, we did something similar where we requested a map for a large project authorizations within a half mile of a large project authorization that we were looking at for a decision and I’d like to request that staff, or through the Chair, request that staff provide a similar map of public transit access for all large project authorizations and sort of add it to that map we are currently getting.
Commissioner Moore:
I would just like to report to the Commission that the subcommittee for the Rules met today for the first time. It was a lively meeting, time was much too short and we will be meeting again on March 2nd, and report with more detail then.
Commissioner Johnson:
March 5th.
Commissioner Moore:
March 5th? I’m sorry what did I say, March 5thyes, thank you.
6.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Good Afternoon Commissioners, I was just going to mention the memo that Corey Teague put in your packet last week regarding the Prop M allocation numbers. We’re happy to discuss that further, we wanted you to have the latest numbers on that to look at with an updated list of projects that are currently in queue. To Commissioner Antonini, I don’t really have a timeline for you at this point. We are working on a lot of those issues you raised. Hopefully, we’ll be able to come back to you this summer with something more definitive.

Board of Appeals:
The Board of Appeals did meet last night. I think three items to brief the Commission on. The first would be an appeal on a Variance decision letter for 312 Green Street. This was heard by the Commission as a DR back in October. The Commission unanimously decided Not to Take Discretionary Review, the Board heard the Variance appeal last night, and with a two to one vote, voted to uphold the Variance decision. They were absent one Commissioner last night, they need three votes to take any action, so, just by default the Variance was upheld, I think it was a well reasoned decision letter that Mr. Teague issued on that project. The second item is 125 Crown Terrace, which was an appeal of a building permit application last night at the Board of Appeals. The permit sought to change the method of construction. When this was before this Commission several years ago it was an alteration permit and an alteration under the Planning Code. It did not meet the thresholds of Section 317 to be considered a demolition or tantamount to demolition. As you probably are well aware, in December of 2013 there was a catastrophe at the site where the building, did fall. Shoring, that was underneath the building, was not built as per plan and the building collapsed. They subsequently revised the application. The project stayed the same, the end result was the same building envelope, that was approved by this Commisison and the Board of Appeals, but they had to remove more of the building, they could salvage and would be a demolition under Section 317 and Section 317 deemed that it qualified, it was demonstrably not affordable housing, the assessed value, it was unique case, because the building did collapse, we based the assessment on the appraised value of the land plus the site works that had been done to date, as the date of the collapse of the building and that exceeded $1.506 million. We did, even though it was administratively reviewed, it still was subject to Section 311, there were no Discretionary Reviews filed, but there was an appeal of the building permit last night. The Board unanimously upheld that permit, so it may move forward. Lastly, over the past few weeks and months have seen, I think it’s safe enough to characterize it as an uptick, but a number of dwelling unit removals that, removal of illegal dwelling units. Often times at the Board of Appeals hearings people will argue that they should be subject to Section 317 or subject to the Mayor’s Executive Directive. A lot of these are single-family dwellings that have illegal second units and they are not subject to Section 317 nor are they subject to the Mayor’s Executive Directive. So, just wanted to make you aware that we have had a couple of these recently at the Board of Appeals, just to keep you advised of the goings on at the Board of Appeals. I’m available for any questions.
Historic Preservation Commission:
Commissioners, Director Rahaim good afternoon, Karl Hasz President of the Historic Preservation Commission. Thank you for accommodating me today on this sort of, an unusual appearance. But basically, we only communicate through letters, normally. And, I don’t think the letters always fully describe our backgrounds of discussions and our sort of direction we are taking. And so I want to come to you on one specific one today, we have a policy paper that we are going to be voting on, that we have not voted on yet, but we have consensus at the Commission that I want to talk about, very briefly. It’s on the Draft Environmental Reports coming out on the Draft Environmental Reports and the Preservation Alternatives. And what we’re seeing more and more of, is a very frustrating situation where Preservation is being blamed for completely messing with the sponsor’s goals if any part of a building is saved that is significant. And what we see is that, let’s say they’ll have a 150 units or 100 units that they want to do and if there’s a significant building on the property and they want to save any of it all of a sudden they have to chop the project in half. And, that is from lack of creativity, not from Preservation, not from the Historic Preservation Commission. We see the one on Pine Street recently, where they took out the building, they didn’t have to, they could have easily put it right into the design of the façade. It would have been considered demo by definition, but at least they could have saved the façade, they could have saved some semblance of what was there, what that block looked like back in the day, and you’ve got another project coming before you shortly, where it’s the same thing. Where all of a sudden it is two towers, if they save any part of the building one tower goes away. And, the Historic Preservation Commission, our goal is to meet sponsor’s goals. We want them to build as much as they can. But we also would like to preserve significant buildings, at least parts of them. And, so it’s been a very frustrating thing and so, our letters, sometimes like I said, it’s very tough to go into a full explanation of where we’re coming from. We may just disagree with the environmental report and then preservation alternatives in that report, so that’s why I’m here today is to say that there is a lot more behind that. And then President Fong and I were speaking, and Vice President Wu and I were speaking earlier, and it might be smart of us to occasionally do a check in with each other. A combination meeting, no voting or anything like that, but just a here’s where we’re coming from, here’s what we are feeling these days and here’s what we’re seeing. Just with so much development happening, you know from our side with Preservation we want to try to keep some consistency in this City and what this places have looked like for so long.
