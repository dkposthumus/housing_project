Commissioner Antonini:
Thank you. I was absent last week and I was actually at spring training and it was very enjoyable. It was sort of like a frat party that included seniors and families with children, a little bit of baseball and a lot of eating and drinking. But, what was kind of instructive, I think and refreshing was what I did not see when I was there, I didn't see broken glass from auto break-ins, I didn’t see one tag of graffiti, I didn’t see trash or litter on the ground, I didn’t see people digging through garbage cans, I didn’t see a single panhandler, a single homeless person passed out on the street or in parks, and didn't see or hear a lot of sirens. I heard one siren and youwould think with all the brittle seniors were there, you'd have more medical responses, but I think, that you know, we've a differentsituation existing here as we often spoke about it. I'm not naive enough to think that the area I was in, was typical, the entire Valley of the Sun. In fact, 1.5 million people now live in Phoenix alone, which makes it the sixth largest city in the United States, and obviously they have areas with challenges that I did not see, but what was instructive, was the fact that I was mostly in Scottsdale, and Scottsdale is the equivalentto our Union Square, South of Market, perhaps North Beach and parts of the Mission District, because is there area where everyone goes, if they are going for shopping, if they aregoing for hotels, if they're going for entertainmentthey don't do anything inPhoenix. It’s not much in downtown Phoenix. Everything is in Scottsdale and that's the area by which people derive their impressions of what that city, generally speaking, of what the Phoenix area is and what they derive their impressions of us.So hopefully,we can work on some of theitems of what I'd like to not see in San Francisco as they have been ableto do for one reason or another in Scottsdale and presumably in other parts of that general metropolitan area. I wasencouraged, very encouraged, to read while I was away, Mayor Lee had a press conference and spoke about the treatment center for homeless, triage center with supportive housingwhichI think isa great first step, we’ve talked about for years, and I think, if we can provide enough and begin to have rules, but also to have treatment that you know willbegin to solve some of theproblems we have because no one is benefiting, most importantly the people who themselves are the victims of this situation and I think this is really a step in the right direction.One other thing that came to mind while I was in that area, I read in the paper that was this talk somewhat facetious talk about putting affordable housing in Oakland for San Francisco, but I think thereis some merit in that, becausethe reason why housing costs are a lot less in an area like Phoenix, is thesame reason, why we were able to grow in 1915, 100 years ago, we had land available, and they just continue to build further and further out and in 1915 we could built western San Francisco and we don'thave enough land left, very little, certainly not enough to meet all thehousing needs.So I think we should take into consideration all the land that san Francisco owns in Alameda and San Mateo Counties which or has control over, because this would be an ideal place to look into, at not just affordable housing but even market rate housing, all types of housing to help build fulfill our needs because to try to think we can build all within the 46 square miles of San Francisco is probably unrealistic and there could be a case made that the housingthat was built on this lands should count towards the quotes or the numbers that ABAG suggest that San Francisco should build as part of meeting the housing demand, because Alameda County gets credit for housing been built east of Livermore, 50 miles away from Oakland. It is technically part of Alameda County, but it is actually one ofthe reasons why they are satisfying their affordable housing goals because even the market rate housing built out there it is low enough to qualify for the 120thpercentile and this could be and we knew, we learnedlong ago we couldn't put an airport in San Francisco, we couldn’t put our water system here, we couldn’t put the jail, there is only so much land, I think one of the solutions for the housing problem are, is to look at some of the area we have control over. Obviously, we would have to have their consent of other counties, which they are located. I know that San Francisco land has been used for housing, out in the Pleasanton area in the past, I am not sure who controls that housing, it was privately built, but the land I think the land was sold to the developer by the City and they developed it I'm sure something like that could be worked out. Anyway, I am happy to be back and looking forward to today’s meeting.
Commissioner Fong:
Happy to have you back!
Commissioner Richards:
I second that, good to have you back as well. On Saturday, I've been invited by the community leadership team in the Mission to do a walk around to hear issues of concern to them, as well as to get I guess the first-hand look at, kind of what these concerns have translated into from a housing point of view. Actually, it kind of coincided; I let you know next week what I’ve learned. We’ve had this thing back and forth last couple weeks, of stop market rate housing in the Mission, because we need more affordable housing, and it doesn’t – it seemslike mutual exclusively goals, butI cameacross an article yesterday in the Examiner by Joe Fitzgerald Rodriguez , I don’t know if anybody read this guy, but actually he is a pretty smart guy, and actually he really opened my eyes to the fact thatboth of those sides actually have some kind of truth, because we have ashort-term problem trying to be addressed by a long-term solution and I think each side is trying to figure out how they are going to bring the opposing sides together to actually solve the problem and I think it is really something that we need to think about a little more in depth, about how we are going to solve this kinds of problem because by time the solution is actually at hand, the problem has gone away because there is nobody left, so I think is a really interesting article. Please try to check it out, Joe Fitzgerald Rodriguez yesterday in the Examiner.
Commissioner Moore:
Updating the Commission on the subcommittee on rules, we met today and we are making progress. It was really our first meeting in which we were discussing items; the first meeting we had, just had to organize ourselves around issues. Today we substantively discussed the amendments of the submittal guidelines. Mr. Joslin made a very good presentation and we will come back to the full Commission within the next month, I would say, to report and submit a number of findings.
Commissioner Fong:
Thank you for all you efforts.
D.DEPARTMENT MATTERS
12.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Good afternoon, Commissioners. Just one announcement today, I just wanted to let you and actually members of the public to know that in response to the high demand for registration for short-term rentals, the Department is holding an evening hours session to accommodate folks who might want to come in that will be next Wednesday, March 18 from 4:00 to 7:00 pm, that will be walk-in only, for that particular time period we're asking people not to make an appointment just to walk in. During normal business hours we are asking folks to make appointment, but next Wednesday from 4:00 to 7:00 pm in the Department at 1650 Mission we will be taking walk-in appointments for short term housing registration, short-term rentals registration.I will also let you know we received at this point 1,000 phone calls from folks trying to register and the numbers are fairly overwhelming, so we are trying to register people as fast as we can and just to remind folks that I said two weeks ago it is important and the legislation does require that you have a business license in hand before coming to the Department to actually register for short-term rental.
