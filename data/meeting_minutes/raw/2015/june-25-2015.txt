ABSENT:Fong, Johnson
8.Commission Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements.Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Moore:
I'd like to ask the Director for some input, walking downtown yesterday at lunchtime, I realized that there are a large number of Uber cars circling the block and circling the block, and while I think we have apps to direct people to parking spaces, Uber as a substitute taxi company, I assume is not enjoying zones identified for parking of vehicles that are there to transport others. I’m looking at this as being somewhat contradictory to our transit policy first, because one transit is supposed to be what we use downtown, in the middle of the day, the circling of Uber cars around the block, I think is more than questionable, particularly when other cabs are waiting in the appropriately identified zones. I just want to make a comment on that as I believe that the increasing number of Uber cars is starting to at least visual look as be in contradiction to our transit first policy.
Commissioner Richards:
In this morning’s Chronicle, I was shocked when picked it up and there's a TV show called Million Dollar Listing that all over the country they have now and San Francisco’s kind of entered that TV show. Now, they wanted to – Kathleen Pender who writes the network column, wants to have a billion dollar over asking listing show and if you read the article, here’s the house on, I think it was 10THAvenue, that was listed for $1.895 and it got $3 million and the whole article goes through properties that are listed slightly under what they should go for, going way, way, way over and you know, I studied economics in school ad nauseam, I had a business degree, and if you really look, the strain of the article is, the market’s is losing logic. It’s really been driven by emotion and there are actually quotes by some folks who paid over a million asking and said, “I really like the property, what’s another million?” So the whole kind of premise around supply and demand, the whole rational market, I think is starting, in my opinion, to kind of erode when I see things like this happening.
Commissioner Moore:
I yesterday morning read Carl Nolte’s article on the National Trust List, the Old Mint as an endangered historic site and I wanted to make sure that we’re staying apprised to any moves by the Planning Department or by the Mayor’s Office, to look at it this property more closely since unbeknownst to me it is a City-owned site. I think it is a great opportunity to complement other restored buildings in that area and I’d like us to get an update or any kind of ideas that might arise from the Department itself.
Commissioner Antonini:
I also saw that and am very supportive of whatever the City can do to make sure this does get restored and I really like the idea of at least part of it being a San Francisco history Museum because there is none, and in almost any other city you go to, there are museums for that, those particular cities histories, and we have very rich one and we need a great site for that. Also,very interesting article in yesterday's Chronicle by John King on, I think it’s 160 Folsom, it’s a future project that will be coming before us only because wehave to approve a part of it but the rest of Transbay does not come before us for decisions, as far I know, but I would ask the Department to have an update on the Transbay situation so we can kind of factor in the developments that are occurring there with what we are approving in other areas around the Transbay region so we can get kind of an update that would be great.
9.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Good Afternoon, Commissioners just if I could on the last item Commissioner Antonini, you had –Commission asked a while ago for updates examples on the Mission Bay. We did the Mission Bay update, I think a couple weeks ago, we have a Transbay one, I think coming up. You do see part of the Transbay the original Transbay redevelopment area is technically not in under your jurisdiction. The particular project that you mentioned will come to you not for the Planning Code Amendment, per se, but for the General Plan Referral for the height difference that is being proposed on that project, so we'll make sure we get it calendared. I wanted to take the opportunity to introduce you our crop of summer interims, many of whom are in the audience today.I'll ask them to stand up, if you all would. We have 15 summer interns this year along with another seven or eight in high school as well. I’ll just, if I may, I'll read their names–and let you know some of the projects that they are working on. [Calling interns names]. There are aslew of projects they're working on: short term rental work, work on the Market Street prototyping festival, pavement to parks program, survey on the City’s housing stock, living alley innovation zones, the urban forestry plan, green roofs, the historic survey program, the neighborhood commercial storefront survey and some transportation planning. All of them are of course are paired with a planner who mentors and supervises their work. They’ll be coming to Commission meetings, Historic Preservation Commission meetings, doing site visits, attending meetings and in the final week, in the summer they'll present their final work products to staff during a series of noontime presentations and clearly, the commissioners are encouraged to attend.I just want to thank you all for your work. Hopefully, you’ll have a great experience this summer. And I want to thank Tina Tam for being the coordinator and organizing all the logistics of the interns. Thank you all.

11.Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission
LAND USE COMMITTEE:
·150357 Planning Code - Rincon Hill Streetscape Master Plan. Sponsor: Planning. Staff: Chasan. Item 1
·150401 General Plan Amendments - Rincon Hill Streetscape Master Plan. Sponsor: Planning. Staff: Chasan. Item 2
These two items formally adopt the Rincon Hill Streetscape Plan into the Planning Code and General Plan, which was a requirement of The Rincon Hill Area Plan.The Streetscape Plan was developed by the Planning Department in partnership with the MTA and the Department of Public Works.The Planning Commission unanimously adopted resolutions in support of these ordinances on March 26, 2015.At the land use hearing, there was no public comment on the legislation.Supervisor Kim expressed her strong support for the Plan’s adoption, and her strong desire to see the plan implemented. Key themes that came up during Supervisor Kim’s comments included Supervisor Kim’s commitment to the recently passed Vision Zero Policy and her desire to see revenues generated by the Rincon Hill Infrastructure Finance District to be directed towards Rincon Hill projects through the budgeting process. She also discussed with Staff whether or not a recently added bulb-out on Harrison Street would impede proposed MUNI expansion plans in the neighborhood, which it would not, and the maintenance implications of the Lansing Street Design, which is the responsibility of the 45 Lansing Street Development and not the City.The Committee then voted unanimously to send the item to the Full Board with a positive recommendation.
FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
·150221 Planning, Public Works Codes - Street Trees and Adoption of Associated Fees. Sponsor: Wiener, Christensen. Staff: D. Sanchez.Passed its First Read.
·150532 Interim Zoning Controls - Conditional Use Requirement for Residential Mergers. Sponsor: Avalos. Staff: Not Staffed.Passed and is awaiting the Mayor’s signature.This interim control will be effective within 10 days of the Board’s action, or when the Mayor signs the resolution, whichever comes first.
INTRODUCTIONS:
·150681 Planning Code - Allowing an Existing Restaurant and/or Bar to Open a Second Location with a Conditional Use Authorization - North Beach Special Use District. Sponsor: Christensen. Staff: Guy.Ordinance amending the Planning Code to allow an existing restaurant and/or bar in the North Beach Special Use District to open a second location in the District with a conditional use authorization provided that it meets certain criteria.
BOARD OF APPEALS:
The Board of Appeals did meet last night. A couple of items that might of interest to the Commission: first, the Board had an informational presentation from the Rent Board. They detailed their services that they offered to landlords and tenants, including with respect to the removal of illegal dwelling units. There was also a rehearing request for 2853-2857 Broderick Street, this was before as a Discretionary Review from last year, one the elements of that project was a dwelling unit merger from two to one unit, but we did determinate based on the appraisal they would comp out of that requirement for a hearing here. It was brought to you for other reasons last year. The Board denied the rehearing request. We did note that pending legislation and the interim controls by Supervisor Avalos would have required a Conditional Use Authorization for this, but that is not yet effective. 910 Carolina Street was a Discretionary Review for demo and construction, which you heard last year, the Board heard this in early May, had concerns about the design and wanted the project sponsors to work with the appellants to revise the design. Project sponsor did so, they lowered the height of the building and made some setbacks at the upper levels, they removed the stairs penthouse. This did not address all the concerns of the appellants and the appellants were not supportive of revised plans. The Board ultimately upheld the project with the revised plans. And 1050 Valencia was before the Board last night for the consideration of revised findings; this was previously decided by the Board. The project is under construction due to a lawsuit, the courts remanded that back to the Board of Appeals, one the concerns that was cited was the analytic bridge and – between the deliberations and the findings that they had. So, the Board had adopted revised findings last night unanimously. Lastly 2251 Greenwich Street, which is the fire station, rebuild of the fire station at this location, this had not been before you but there was an appeal of the environmental review to the Board of Supervisors, which was unanimously upheld as being the correct environmental determination. Last night the Board of Appeals unanimously upheld the permit to allow the reconstruction of fire station for the seismic safety concerns. That's all.
