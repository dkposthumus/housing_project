Commissioner Antonini:
Just to comment on the garage at Civic Center and I don’t know if any of you have run into the same problem I am having, but there are many days when you arrive at 11:30 or little after11:00 and there's someone out there saying it's full. Today there was just a sign saying that it was full. Usually, I can get in by flashing a Commission card and search around and eventually find a single place, but my whole point is that we're not really evaluating the impact of things that are done. For example, the new PUC building was built with the theory that people aren’t going to drive there, we won't provide any parking there, and of course they rob parking from this garage and there is a significant part of it that is reversed for PUC, as well as charging stations for electric cars. These are all good things, but the problem is where, there is only so many parking places and this is a very significant garage, not just for City Hall, but for the courts, for the Orpheum Theater, for a lot of activities in this area that people wish to park in, so I think in the future we should look at situations with reality in mind not the way we wish it would or are going to be. We wish everyone would take public transit or walk or ride a bicycle, but that’s not the reality. So, when we make decisions about where – what kind of parking to provide we have to make sure that we're realistic about our exceptions. Thank you.
Commissioner Richards:
I just wanted to call your attention to an article I read in the Chronicle on Sunday about A.T. Kearny has published a paper. I think they do it every few years on world-class cities and what makes them, they have you the personal well-being, public safety, health care, the economy, GDP innovation, presence of incubators, private investment and good governance. San Francisco currently ranks #22. One through five were New York, London, Paris, Tokyo and Hong Kong but for potential which is coming up within the next decade, San Francisco goes to number one. So, that tells us a lot about where the city is going to be in terms of the attractiveness of people to move here, investment to flow here and if you get a chance, I really suggest that you take a look of that report that A.T. Kearny wrote. It’s on the web if you just search for it. If anybody needs information, I’d be glad to forward it to you, but it’s a really interesting read and it’s an incredible vote of confidence in this City.
