Commissioner Antonini:
Thank you. I had the fortune of spending yesterday at Harding Park watching golf it was sensational, and for those of you who may not know it, in addition to the world golf championship there, two other significant tournaments are taking place in and near San Francisco, last week, this week and the following week. So, it’s a tribute to the foresight of early pioneers who knew that it was a great location for golf and it is world renowned and that’s why we get so many tournaments, but particularly in terms of HardingPark, just want do a shout out to former Supervisor Tony Hall who had the vision enough to renovate the course, which was a great course, but it had fallen into disrepair and one of the things he did when he assumed office in the year 2001, was to get a funding and do a renovation and just allow significant golf tournaments, including the PGA in 2020 to come to that course, and it certainly is worthy of that kind of thing. One of the other things he was able to do, was to divert some of the rainwater that had been running often into treatment plants and into the ocean, into Lake Merced, and the level since that time remained consistently pretty high even in a year when we supposedly have not had a lot of rain, though we did have 18 and half inches so far in San Francisco, those were couple things that were very farsighted on his part. In terms of the drought I'm supportive of efforts to conserve. I think that is sort of the first step. I mean we need to have the vision that our forbearers had to look for sources of water or to get more storage. I mean if we’ve taken the attitude that we are taking today, when we settled San Francisco in the middle of the 19thCentury, they’d have said, we can't live here, because there is no water, there is no trees, there is no greenery, and instead they went to find water, wherever they had to go, and they not only created enough water for San Francisco, but enough to support another one and a half million customers outside of San Francisco. So we need that kind of vision today, because there is lots of water in many places throughout the United States. If we can build pipelines for oil from the north coast of Alaska or across the United States, we certainly can build some for water sources and also let's build our dams, so we can store a little bit more for years when we don't have water, because with the growing population, conservation it is a short sited concept, because you're never going to have enough if you don't store or get new sources, so that's my opinion on the whole situation.
Commissioner Richards:
A couple of things here you'll see me always do this, I don’t know if you’ve seen Sunday’s paper about the Shreve and Company losing the lease in its own namesake building on Tuesday, -- I am sorry, Wednesday, John King had a great couple of paragraphs I’ll read them and there is another paragraph that I would love to read. He writes and I think this speaks to some of the anxiety that a lot of folks are feeling in the City, if you wrap everything up, you could put a big, huge red bow on these 49 square miles and call it San Francisco’s anxiety, it says, “These are unsettling times in San Francisco, where the winds have changed, to reach hurricane force, posh Shreve and Company jewelers, a Union Square mainstay featured in Woody Allen’s Blue Jasmine set to move next year to make way for an out-of-town jeweler that is even more posh. The Elbow Room on Valencia Street, everyone’s favorite punk dive bar, mine included, in the bull’s eye of condo developers. Neighborhood joints like Capp’s Corner in North Beach closed after a rent dispute. It’s a cultural upheaval more than a physical one, triggered by money and demographics, instead of a seismic force. Anything that is not protected landmark is a potential victim of the desire to ride the prosperous wave, the more novel the better. The relics of an era aren’t insights into the urban values of other generations; they’re leftovers to be cleared from the scene.” Next one I would like to read really quick, it is just one paragraph, of all places in the Sunday, the House Section called my attention, about a New Yorker who transplanted here in San Francisco, and she compares what happened here to the mid-1960s in New York, and how basically New York kind of turned on itself. She writes, “San Francisco has filled and arguably supplanted that role, New York. We've got the world’s attention. We are moving markets and defining the future. San Francisco is not just some place, is now the place, which is why exactly we have to be careful not to turn ourselves into another city, destroy itself.” I think, based on the rest of the article, the comment that she is making, is not only in a physical sense, but also in a human sense. We're all San Franciscans, I think every day I walk down the street and hear arguments being made about it should be this way, black, or it should be this way, white. I think there is probably some middle ground where we don't have to destroy ourselves in the process to cut a clear path to the future so this resonated with me a lot. The second point I wanted to make was, I know we recently adopted, very recently actually, I thought that it was earlier, the small businesses processing program in February 12th. I actually looked at the consent items last, because I assumed those are the ones that are the least contentious. I actually spent my time on some of the bigger ones where you got a lot of the communications bit. As I went back to some of the consent items, I think we are going to learn through this process and probably we do some fine-tuning along the way, and each of the pack, I didn't have time this morning to call Mr. Sider, because I was scrambling. When we go through each one of these, I I’d like to make some comments on maybe what we might want to see or maybe what we don’t want see, based on what we have approved and just use as a learning experience. Thank you.
Commissioner Moore:
I have been in touch with Commission Secretary Ionin, this week’s package was a total disaster. I had five duplicates copies on miscellaneous things, assuming that there were five missing in some other Commissioners packets. I had a packet stapled into another major large report, and while that is not necessary, a Planning Commission public discussion, it is something which I like to bring to the attention and get your support that we find mechanisms to help the Department and proper pressure on the vendor that this is a one time occurrence. It creates a significant amount of extra work for us as Commissioners and leads certain people who are also having full-time jobs, scrambling to have the right sequence and the right publications in their packets. I want to make this a constructive comment. I know Mr. Ionin will work on it. We need to give him all support to use all means to have the new vendor properly deliver.
11.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Thank you, Commissioners, we'll certainly look into the packets, the only item I would have is to suggest we that close themeeting today in honor of Commissioner Richards’ beard.That concludes my comments.

BOARD OF APPEALS:
The Board of Appeals did meet last night. There was a fairly lengthy hearing, but just three items to note. The first was an appeal of a building permit for 1055 Ashbury, this had been before you as a discretionary review and was also a variance, earlier this year.The Board of appeals upheld the variance unanimously. On the appeal of the building permit, they expressed some concerns related to the top story. This was a deeply down sloping lot at Ashbury and Downey and the rear of the building appeared quite large given the topography, so they continued it and wanted the project sponsor to study setting back the top story from the rear building wall, so that’ll come back on May 13. The other item is 2853 Broderick, which had been before you as well as a discretionary review last year. The appeal was related to the merger of two units in the building, it is going from two to one. We found that it qualified for administrative review, given appraisals that were given. The Board heard the arguments last night, voted +2 -2 to deny the appeal, that motion failed, but by matter of law the building permit was upheld. Finally, the Board adopted a resolution encouraging the establishment of notice requirements for permits that resulted in removal of illegal residential units. Currently, a building permit application to remove an illegal unit doesn’t in and of itself trigger the notification. We've been working with the Department of Building Inspection and that is actually something we are going to be moving towards fairly soon and it will be improved notification requirements by DBI in the issuance of a permit. We’ll be giving you more of an update on this in the coming weeks and I believe you'll have a copy of the Board of Appeals resolution in your packets for next week.
