Commissioner Antonini:
I'd like to take a moment of personal privilege to memorialize my father and motherJoseph and Doris Antonini and if Jonas would be so good as to put that on the screen, a picture of them from November 29, 1943 at the Claremont Hotel, and they were approximately 29 years old and my uncle Angelo and his wife Adrian the were enjoying the big band and they apparently were having a very good time.The reason I want to particularly mention my father is that he was born on December 20, 1913, so he would have been 102 years old this coming Sunday, and he was delivered in a small ranch house outside of Livermore in a rural area by his father Angelo and they didn't have any electricity until 1937 out there because they didn't get it until the Rural Electrification Act.They lived a really humble life and he didn’t speak English until he was six years old, and he was a made to repeat third grade by the nuns of Saint Michael’s School in Livermore, and he thought they were a big reason why he was successful in his life as an insurance agent and gave them a nice donation upon his death in 2004,acknowledging the fact that he wouldn't have been successful and the things that he did if he couldn't speakEnglish so credited the nuns for doing that.The other thing I want to mention, during his life, he also served for 10 years on the Planning Commission in Pleasanton, California.So I brought the little sign he's kept in his office until just recently when the house is going to be rented out to other people, so we brought all the gear into San Francisco.I thank you for your time and have a Merry, Merry Christmas.
Commissioner Moore:
I would like to ask we close in memory of Mary Brown today; the Planning Department before the holidays has encountered a very shocking loss of a colleague who was highly respected, and who we all know, through her exemplary work on the restoration of the Mission Theater. I ask to close in her memory.
10.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Good afternoon Commissioners, I was also going to request that we adjourn the meeting in honor of Mary today. If you allow me to make a few comments about her work, Mary passed away last week after a long illness; she has been with the Department since 2008, which is actually the same year I started. Her previous employment was with the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition. She was an avid bicyclist and she became an avid researcher on best bicycle practices worldwide in that work, and design standards, innovative engineering and so on.She then returned to graduate school and led her into a career in preservation. She was an avid researcher, she really dove into the work and was really interested in more than just the architecture, but in the events that happened in the City, who occupied the buildings, and she was the manager until she had to take her leave, she was the manager of a what we call the Landmark Designation Work Program, which is the work program where the research is done to landmark buildings and sites in the City that go to the Historic Preservation Commission and among others she did the research for St. Jordan’s Bar in the Bayview, for Marcus Books, and the research that won her several awards, was for what is called The Modern Architecture and Landscape Design Historic Context Statement, for that work she wona Governor’s Award for Historic Preservation in 2011, and California Preservation Foundation award for that same piece of work. She also did the work and was the primary author for the Golden Gate Park Landmark District and the Stow Lake Boathouse Landmark District among many other works. She was a much loved member of staff. She passed much too young. She was 46 years old and we will miss her greatly. Thank you.
