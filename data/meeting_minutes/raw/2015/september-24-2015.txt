Commissioner Moore:
With regards to an e-mail I received this morning, I want to clarify my comment that my comments have been taken out of context from a long conversation about architecture urban design and planning in this city. I want to make clear that my basic goal is, has been and always will be to support and further good urban design planning and architecture for San Francisco together with the department and director who are creating it. My intent was not to hurt or insult anybody and in the course of what was reported, I regret any misunderstanding. I'm turning to speak to the department at large and to the director and everybody else. Thank you.
Commissioner Antonini:
Yeah. Thank you. Just in the process of clearing out a family home in the East Bay, where the last of my father's generation has gone into assisted living at 98th, found a lot of things that have been kept there for decades and among them were paper I wrote when I was a senior in high school on demographics in San Francisco. What was interesting is I had supporting material from the Planning Department when it was on Larkin Street, from Spur and from Chamber of Commerce. The most interesting thing that I found that isappropriate for us today is to realize that we hear a lot about families moving away, we hear a lot about some of the effects of the presents time but a lot of these things were set up many years ago. In the 50s, there was a significant loss of population in San Francisco from its previous high of 775,000 in 1950, lost about 8% and another 8% in the 60s. This was predominately families with children moving to suburbia and the nature of the city changed drastically and what it did set up is a lot of areas in the city, most notably the older neighborhoods where they had Victorians in Western Addition,Haight Ashbury in the Mission District, which drops significantly in value, became really difficult to rent.You know that kind of set up the situation we deal with today, I mean the causes of this whole thing have a long history and aren’t something that just occurred since the year 2000. Now we see the opposite in affect, as the mayor has recorded the unemployment rate dropped to a very low level and there’s been a huge increase in population. So we have the opposite kind of conditions in existence today as it was in San Francisco so naturally there’s going to be conflict that are going to be development but it’s important to look at these things in the long view and not a narrow view over a few years. Thank you.
Commissioner Richards:
Yes I have 3 things, first, I guess to Commissioner Moore's commission comments. I have been interviewed by the press many times and gone onextemporaneouslysaid things and I read the paper the next day and I kind of call up the reporter and say how did you get that and how did you piece this with that? Actually sometimes, I read it and I think “God if someone reads the comments you'll really look stupid Dennis.”I completely understand how things happen. I did read the article this morning and I’m still learning as a commissioner on urban design and I'm not anywhere near where I need to be. I appreciate the comments in a constructive way and to err is human and to forgive is divine; I appreciate what you just said. Couple of other items, more serious then I’ll go to a lighter item. There was an article in the chronicle on Wednesday, this Wednesday, about the amount of rent increases based on venture capital investment in any city, in billions, studied by Zumper. I'm going to have to go out and look at the data behind it. They're correlating for every billion dollars in venture capital that flows through a city, in San Francisco specifically, the increase in a one bedroom apartment is $69 and a two bedroom apartment is $99. We’ve had $15 billion of venture capital and the conclusion of the reports drawn is that the rents have increased 35 to 55 percent as a result. I think the point of this is, it’s a double-edged sword. We have this great economic boom but there’s a cost to it, it seems like we are looking back and playing catch up a lot on this.So now, next time you read in the Business Times another billion dollars gets invested, imagine $69 more for a one bedroom is going up because these rents have been going up every month. I’ve been reading how they’re going up; it is really correlated with the amount of venture capital. San Francisco is a small town with very limited resources in terms of housing given the onslaught of venture capital money and the influx of population that is causing everybody wants to come here because it’s a large economy and is where you want to be pretty much globally. That's a very good article. It also said that the other local that aren’t even known known for the rent increases are experiencing the same thing: San Diego is up 10%, Boston up 10%, San Jose up 25% as a result. It’s a good read if you want to take a look at it; it’s the Zumper report in Wednesday Chronicle. On a lighter note there was an article, I believe it was Sunday, called From Paradise to Parody San Francisco Surreal detour. I don't know if anyone, I see some smiles in the audience, it actually talks about some of the kind of out there things that are happening as a result of a lot of money being in the city from doggy spas to the kind of you know people paying $40 for a hamburger and things like that, is a really interesting article. Kind of tongue and cheek but there is an element of truth to it. If you get a chance take a look at it. It’s really well written and graphically it’s well depicted as well. It was written by John King and Heather Knight. Thank you.
Commissioner Moore:
I'd like to add a comment to what was said the phenomena steep rent increase is not just only happening in this country, it’s happening abroad but there is an interesting byline to it that many cities, not only from the US but also from abroad, are looking at what we're doing. I think we have in the dialogue which is somewhat ahead of institutional structure the city gives us the ability to discuss and bring on measures to address the issues at a much faster ways than other cities have.
9.Director’s Announcements
Good afternoon, Commissioners, just two items today that I would like to mention, oneis thememo in ourpacket that I wrote to ABAG and MTC regarding this potential merger of certain functionsandtheir two agencies,I both wrote this memo andattended a hearing and testified at the hearing on Wednesday as well, what is under consideration quickly as a matter of fact, is apotential merger of – I should saya shiftingof ABAG planning functions into MTC, the MTC staff is proposed thisand proposed a new structure, and proposed shifting resources they nowgive to ABAG to shift those resources to MTC there was a lot of testimonythere was a lot of concern ourposition has been that a mergerhaving a single regional planning function it is actually quite a good idea, to combine land use and transportation, resiliency planning andall the very issues we deal with,our concern was the way it was being handled and how fast it was being proposed, because the initialproposal was in fact that this will happen he bythe end of this year, and there is a lot of discrepancies, on howthis two organization are run, a lot of overlap,so our testimony andletter specific speaks to theidea that we will support them and help them in their thinking, but they should take more timeto get it right and make surethat whatever planning function is left is comprehensive in nature and covers all planning issues, not justtransportation,there were a lot of other folks including SPUR and Supervisor Wiener and Supervisor Campos that were there who supported thatidea,as well as well as MayorSchaafofOakland, who I would recommend if you have a chance tohear her comments on this – was quite eloquent on the issue, there were quite good.

10.Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission
LAND USE COMMITTEE:
•150496 Planning Code - Inclusionary Housing Requirements in the Eastern Neighborhoods.Sponsor: Kim. Staff: Starr. This ordinance would eliminate the Rental Incentive program from the Eastern Neighborhood Urban Mixed Use Districts that permits project sponsors to lower their Inclusionary Affordable Housing requirements and applicable Eastern Neighborhood Public Benefit Fee by agreeing to maintain the units as rental for 30 years. The Planning Commission heard this item on August 6, 2015 and voted unanimously to recommend approval to the Board of Supervisors. At the Committee hearing, there was no public comment and no comments from the committee members except Supervisor Kim who spoke about why she introduced the ordinance. The Committee voted unanimously to recommend the Ordinance to the Full Board.
•150790 Planning Code - Establishing a New Citywide Transportation Sustainability Fee. Sponsor: Mayor; Wiener, Breed and Christensen. Staff: Chen. This item was continued for one week.
FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
•150586 Planning Code, Zoning Map - Rezoning a Portion of Daggett Street to Public Use/Open Space Zoning.Sponsor: Cohen. Staff: Wertheim. Passed its first read.

UPDATE ON THE 2015 CODE CORRECTIONS ORDINANCE
The 2015 Code Corrections Ordinance is scheduled to be heard at the Board of Supervisors Land Use Committee on October 5. You will recall that the Commission authorized additional non-substantive corrections to be made that are discoveredSummary of Board Activities Week September 21-25, 2015Planning Commission Report: September 24, 2015 subsequent to the Commission’s referral of the Ordinance to the Board. So far we have identified four non-substantive changes that I have asked the City Attorney to add to a revised ordinance.
We also identified an additional control that was inadvertently removed as part of the Article 2 ordinance. As you may remember the intention with the Article 2 Ordinance was to not make any substantive changes; therefore, the Department is requesting that this item also be added into the 2015 Code Corrections Ordinance. However, the City Attorney’s office has determined this to be a substantive change because it was removed from the Code by an ordinance, and its addition back into the Code was not discussed as part of the Code Corrections ordinance.
The proposed change would add a footnote and corresponding reference to Section 209.3, which is the Zoning Control Table for the RC Districts under the Group Housing Controls to require Conditional Use authorization if the Group Housing is affiliated with and operated by a Hospital or an Institutional Educational Use. This is the same language required for the RM Zoning Districts in Table 209.2.
Today I’m here to ask if any of the Commissioners have any questions or objections, or would like further information on this proposed addition to the Code Corrections Ordinance. If not, we can proceed at the Board with this additional correction. If so, this item can be scheduled for discussion by the Commission at a later date, but it would not be able to be included in the Code Corrections ordinance and would require its own separate ordinance.

PROPOSED COMMISSION-SPONSORED INTERIM CONTROLS RELATED TO THE MISSION ACTION PLAN (MAP) 2020- Pursuant to Planning Code Section 306.7(e), on July 9, 2015 the Planning Commission initiatedInterim Controls in the Mission District. The interim controls are intended to make explicit the Commission’s expectation for a dialogue about affordability; allow time for analysis of affordable housing needs; assess sites for affordable housing production; and stem the loss of existing income protected units while maintaining production, distribution, and repair (PDR) capacity in PDR zoned lands and preserving vital community resources. The proposed controls would require a Conditional Use authorization for certain projects which result in any of the following: 1) the loss of one or more rent-controlled dwelling units; or 2) the net addition or new construction of more than 25,000 gross square feet or the net addition of less than 25,000 that would displace a tenant or includes less than 10 residential units but has sufficient lot area to trigger section 415 of the Planning Code; or 3) demolition or conversion of certain assembly, recreation, arts and entertainment, PDR or institutional uses. The area proposed for interim controls is generally defined by the following boundaries: 13thand Division Streets to Mission Street, to Cesar Chavez Street, to Potrero Avenue, and back to 13thand Division Streets—except that the Mission Street boundary would include any parcel with a property line on either side of Mission Street. The interim controls would be proposed for a period of nine months. At this hearing the Commission may amend and adopt the interim controls.
