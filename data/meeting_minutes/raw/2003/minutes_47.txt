1. 1999.233E (B. WYCKO: (415) 558-5972)
833 - 881 JAMESTOWN AVENUE-Appeal of Preliminary Negative DeclarationThe project sponsor proposes construction of a Planned Unit Development (PUD) that would consist of 198 one-, two- and three-bedroom market-rate condominiums on an approximately 6.9-acre lot, located at 833-881 Jamestown Avenue on Assessor's Block 4991, Lot 277, on the northern slope of  Bayview Hill.  The site is currently used as an overflow parking lot for events at Candlestick Park, which is approximately one-third of a mile southeast of the project site.  The site is bordered by Jamestown Avenue (and single-family homes on the north side of Jamestown) to the north, another vacant lot to the east that also is used for parking for major events at Candlestick Park, the hillside to the south, and single-family housing to the west.  Although the area proposed for development is mostly flat, development would require excavation of up to approximately 30 vertical feet at the base of the hill.  The project would consist of 11 separate three- and four-story buildings:  seven buildings of 12 to 18 units each along Jamestown Avenue and four buildings to the rear, at the base of the hillside.  Of these latter four structures, two (36 units each) would be built atop one-story gated parking garages, while smaller buildings (one of eight and one of 10 units) would flank the garages.  A total of 216 independently accessible parking spaces would be provided.  The proposed project would include landscaping along Jamestown Avenue, construction of a 10-foot-wide sidewalk, two off-street freight loading areas, and about 28,900 sq. ft. of common open space, including two rear yards at the base of the hillside totaling about 7,250 sq. ft. and podium- and ground-level patios.  The project also would remedy an existing drainage problem on Bayview Hill above the project site, on Recreation and Park Department land.  The project site is located within the South Bayshore Plan area, in an RH-2 (Two-Family) Use District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.  As a PUD, the project would require review and approval by the City Planning Commission pursuant to Sections 303 and 304 of the Planning Code.

8. Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Antonini:
Re: Process Problems between Board of Supervisors and Planning Commission
- It is becoming quite clear that there is a process problem between the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors on a number of issues.
- There have been items continued from the Planning Commission agenda because there have been negative declaration appeals at the Board of Supervisors.
- The process makes it very uncertain for the sponsors and opponents of when items are actually going to be heard and decided upon.
- There seems to be a lot of appeals going on.
- He hopes to see in the new year rectification of these problems.
Commissioner Bill Lee:
Re:  Landmarks Board
- He requested a presentation/discussion with the Planning Commission by the Landmarks Advisory Board or its Executive Director on their goals and objectives as well as any issues they might have.
Acting Director Responded:
- This will be scheduled at the end of February.
C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT
9. Director's Announcements
Re:  BART Transit Oriented Development Guidelines
- He recently received this document.  It was a two year process lead by Mr. Peter Albert, Manager of Planning for BART for San Francisco and San Mateo.  Mr. Albert was formerly a member of our staff.
- This document is available.
10. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
BOS -
Board of Supervisors Meeting of December 16, 2003:
701 Lombard Street:
- This Mitigated Negative Declaration became final on January 15, 2003.
- The appeal was filed in November of 2003.
- There was no appeal of the Negative Declaration.
- The City Attorney ruled that there was not a requirement that the sponsors exhaust their legal remedies by coming to the Commission.  The City Attorney also ruled that since there were no timelines, they could not advise the Board that it wasn't timely.  That would be a decision that the Board had to make.
- The Board voted +6-4 that it was timely (Dufty, Gonzalez, Hall and Ma voted No).
- For the consideration of the full matter, the Board voted +7-3 to require an EIR rather than a Mitigated Negative Declaration.  There were concerns about views from the North Beach Playground to Russian and Nob Hill and that the potential historic nature was not considered for the North Beach Playground.
Re:  937-939 Jackson Street
- This project had a categorical exemption and a general rule exclusion.
- The project sponsor met with MUNI and the affected neighbors and ultimately came out with some conditions that everyone was going to be able to live with.
- For the conditions that staff would have been recommending today, Supervisor Daly felt that he did not trust the majority of the Planning Commissioners to impose the conditions so he required that a Negative Mitigated Declaration be prepared.
- This was voted +7-3.
BOA -
Re:  2545 Greenwich Street
- This was a merger of three units to two units.  The Commission disapproved the merger and the Board of Appeals overturned the Commission's decision.
Re:  540 8thAvenue
- This was a demolition and new construction.  The Commission disapproved the demolition and the Board of Appeals overturned the Commission's decision.
Re:  1835 19thAvenue
- This was a demolition and new construction.  The Commission approved the demolition, a neighbor appealed the project.  The Board upheld the Commission's decision.
Re:  660 28thAvenue
- This was a lot split and two new units being built.  The Commission approved the project, a neighbor appealed but the Board upheld the Commission's decision.

- Now, thanks to affordable housing, he is able to have his own room.
- It is important to have interim controls and not policies.
Kyle Fiore
- She is in support to having interim controls and not policies.
- As an educator, she realizes that it takes a village to make a home.
- Families, youth and community members need to be able to live in a place they can call home.
Fred Snyder
- He is a resident of the NEMIZ.
- He is not in support of policies or controls.  The controls meant no development.  In his neighborhood, everything has become so political that it has become a "war zone."  He needs a stable environment for everyone in the community.
- It is important to look at this information and [continuing for] two weeks is fair.
- He showed a map of the NEMIZ pointing out that in the core PDR areas, housing has been introduced.
- The definition of Core PDR in the information presented to the Commission is misleading.
Robert Meyers
- He is in support of policies and not controls.  If controls are adopted, control will be lost.
- There have been controls for two years already.  Policies will give flexibility on what should be approved or not.
- If PDR is promoted, there will be more PDR space and less housing.
Chris Selig - Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition
- She is in support of controls.
- In the Mission, specifically, it is very imperative to have controls.
- It is important to maintain the PDR space.
- Control will not be lost with controls.  This is a total fallacy.
- Guidelines seem to be like "anything goes."
- They are not against development; just that development should be built intelligently.
Alex Hernandez
- She is a youth project coordinator and affordable housing tenant.
- She is here in support of affordable housing.
- Interim controls promote affordable housing and protect jobs.  Interim controls are important because the Planning Department will be adopting this.
- Interim controls will protect the community.
- Interim controls allows the public to be involved in the decision-making process.
Antonio Diaz - PODER/MAC
- He is in support of adopting interim controls.
- It is important to consider the fact that no one knows how the economy is going to be in two or three years.  It is important now to have protection in place for neighborhoods.
- The need for protecting PDR spaces has been continually reiterated.
- MAC has done focus groups as well as community meetings and the outcome of all this is that housing and jobs are the most important issues.
- Controls will help allow for these things.
Teresa Garcia - Mission Economic Association
- She is here to advocate for interim controls and not policies.
- It doesn't make sense to have a neighborhood based on a location-by-location basis.
- The decisions being made will be affecting people.
Joaquin Turner
- He supports interim controls.
- Proponents of interim controls state that this will protect businesses but don't state exactly how.
- Interim policies will push [out] PDR and threaten San Francisco's diverse economy.
- Planning for the future is important.
Jeffrey Leibovitz
- Interim policies are the way to go.
- Flexibility is important because the economy is not stable.
- The reality of two years ago is not the reality of today.
- There are some legal ramifications because [some feel that] under interim controls there is no need for approval of the Board.  This is false.
- He urges the Commission to put entertainment language in the policies section.
- The public benefits are extremely important and no one has talked about it.
Maria Hernandez
- She has been living 18 years in the Mission District.
- It is unfair that poor people have had to pay high rent.
- It is important to have rent controls.
- She urged the Commission to do something to help the people who are paying such high rents.
- Low-income people cannot afford to have a decent meal because they have to save the money for the high rents.
Jose Morales
- He is willing to continue to work for housing justice and peace.
- He is here in support of interim controls because without that there is no way to control the situation.
- There are people who want more and more money.
- He has lived in his home for 38 years.
- He is willing to fight for his neighbors.  It is important to preserve affordable housing.
Judy West
- She lives and works in the Northeast Mission area.
- It is confusing the way things are presented.
- South of Mariposa there are numerous blocks designated as PDR that have a lot of housing.  It is misleading to designate areas as core PDR that contain housing.
- She displayed photographs of buildings that desperately need upgrading.
- There are a lot of people who are testifying today representing low income residents that have been mislead thinking that controls will promote low income housing.
- Core PDR is not the solution and certainly not controls.
Milton Gaines
- He has been living in the Mission District for 34 years.
- The need for flexibility is important.
- If controls are set, it would limit opportunities.
- The word controls--in the eyes of non profit housing--is an effort to shut down all development on a footprint larger than 15,000 square feet.
- Policies are what is important.
Steve Vettel
- The public benefit zoning should focus on open space and the streetscape (things that haven't been able to be paid for from property taxes).
- He would be very cautious about putting the very number one item in the public benefit--zoning additional affordable housing--above the inclusionary ratio that there is now.  The inclusionary ordinance was just adopted two years ago and is working well.
- If all of a sudden after two years, the 12 percent/10 percent standards is thrown out, this would cause an impact on the pro-formas.
- The Rincon Hill Draft Plan talks about the mellarouse district and he recommends that this discussion be extended to the rest of the Eastern Neighborhoods.
Luis Granados
- He is disappointed that the full Commission is not present to take a vote on this matter.
- He does have to take issue with a couple of Commissioners and the factual evidence being presented.  They dismiss this information because they don't like it.  Decisions cannot be made this way.
- This is about creating and sustaining PDR areas.
- He encourages the Commission to adopt controls and adopt the public benefit.  It is important to focus on the socio economic impacts.
My Do - Mission Economic Development Association
- The important thing about PDR businesses is that they are a balanced approach to economic development.  Yes, people need places to live but they also need jobs.
- These businesses also provide goods and services to other sectors of the economy and contribute to a diverse economic base.  This is very important when there is an economic downturn.
- PDR jobs and businesses need to be projected.
- She urges the Commission to adopt interim controls instead of policies.
Sue Hestor
- The developers want flexibility, the people that are concerned about the future in the area being proposed would rather have options preserved rather than options foreclosed.
- The land values should not go so high because the public interest would not be well served.
- People still have to come here and fight project by project and lose project by project.
- Since 1996, all the housing built in the Mission and industrial areas have been market rate.  This is not healthy.
Shawn Gorman
- The showplace square workshop process had an unusual amount of consensus for a neighborhood process.
- The mixed use alternative which is used in Exhibit B was the basis for option B of Potrero Hill/Showplace Square.
- The exhibit clearly states that there will be no net PDR loss, then Exhibit A is trying to retain PDR in an area that is NC (neighborhood serving businesses).
- There has been a lot of work done over the years to try to find something that will meet the PDR needs and meet the evolutionary needs that are going to have to occur in this area.
Ada Chan - Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition
- When she received the packet she did like everyone else and looked lot by lot and street by street.  Then she decided not to continue and just be excited to be at this meeting.
- A decision needs to be made sooner or later.
- Although there are disagreements with various groups, she believes that controls are the best decision.
- There are also speculations on all sides so everyone just  needs to trust staff.
Richie Hart - Residential Builders Association and Potrero Boosters
- Staff needs to check their facts more closely.
- He believes that one can get the names and addresses of new businesses from the Tax Collector.  The only thing that one cannot obtain is the amount of tax that these businesses pay.
- Interim controls do not work and do not make any sense at all.
- There is a major shortage of housing in the City.
- No one has thought of UCSF at Mission Bay.
- He would like Commissioners to vote no on Interim Controls.
Joe O'Donoghue - Residential Builders
- Builders are in favor of jobs.
- Before the Commission makes a decision, there is a need for more data.
- Information on the breakdown of the loss of PDR over the 10 years to know what the trend has been.
- This information is not before the public.
- Someone from the Controller's office needs to come to the Commission to answer questions and provide information.
Alice Barkley
- She is in agreement with the comments made by Ms. Murphy, Mr. Leibovitz, and Mr. Vettel.
- She prefers the policy of interim policies.
- If the Board of Supervisors decided to create a special affordable use district, which there are plenty in the Planning Code, the Commission would then have to impose the 4:1 requirement or whatever is in the interim controls.  So there is no flexibility.  That is why she prefers policy and not interim controls.
Chris Durazo
- There is no consensus in the South of Market.  There is a lot of poverty in that area and this is going to grow.
- Although there is West SOMA, which will be taken out of this process, controls are important.
- There are going to be a lot of projects coming before the Commission in the future so she is concerned about all this.
- There are issues about decent jobs with residents of SOMA.  Areas around the bridge are being ignored.
- Public benefit zoning is very important although there are a lot of different levels.

Joe O'Donaghue
Re: Actions at the Board of Supervisors
- At the Tuesday Board of Supervisors' meeting, $20,000 per unit was added on to a potential 18 units of housing.  This was the result of a state law which now allows negative declarations to be appealed at the Board of Supervisors.  Unfortunately, the Supervisors spent about 4+ hours on what was surreal discussions because the vote was already predetermined.
- He is looking seriously at filing protests on every single negative declaration that comes out of every project to the Board of Supervisors.
- He is probably going to do this beginning in January.
- Last year City workers suffered from the deficit.
- This year labor will have to take cuts which they are not willing to do.
- There is a need to understand that jobs are leaving this City as a results of dumb decisions, and housing is becoming more and more expensive.
