5.  Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Antonini:
Re:  Stonestown Project
- He would like to update the public regarding his involvement in the Stonestown Project which will be coming before the Commission on February 27, 2003.
- It has been determined that his residence is within 397 feet from the beginning of the Stonestown project.  He has been speaking with the City Attorney's office regarding this but now the question that remains is that if the distance is measured from where the project is actually taking place or where the property begins.  He also has to prove that there will be no financial gain to his property from the Stonestown project.
- Within the next couple of days he will be receiving information from the City Attorney's office regarding these issues.
Commission William Lee:
Re: Enforcement
- He would like to have staff work with the City Attorney's office to investigate methods of enforcement and enforcement fines for Planning Code violations and to draft the appropriate legislation to ensure that any fines collected stay with the Planning Department.
Re:  Process regarding receiving impact fees
- He would like the Director to let the Commission know who notifies whom to ensure that the impact fees are collected.
C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT
6. Director's Announcements
Re: President Bradford Bell's Mom
- Welcomed her to the Commission hearing (she was in the audience).
Re: His daughter's birthday
- Sent a birthday wish to his daughter.
Re: Commissioner William Lee's Question regarding collecting impact 
        fees.
- Impact fees are required under the Planning Code. They come in the 
        form of contributions to open space funds (both downtown and citywide); 
        transit impact development fees and the affordable housing fund.
- The Board of Supervisors had considered legislation which would have 
        made the Treasurer's office be the ones to collect these fees.
- This legislation has not moved forward because there hasn't been a 
        hearing.
- The Planning Department, in response to a budget committee issue at 
        least two fiscal years ago, reacted by hiring two administrative assistants. 
        One was hired to monitor the collection of impact fees, and the other 
        was a position to make sure that the Department was collecting all other 
        fees appropriately.
- The Planning Department is responsible for collecting these impact 
        fees.
- The Director feels that the department is doing a good job collecting 
        these fees.
Larry Badiner's response related to this matter:
- Some of the fees are required to be collected upon issuance of the 
        first addendum to the site permit of a major downtown building, and some 
        of the fees are required to be collected prior the issuance of a Certificate 
        of Occupancy.
- There is communication between the Department of Building Inspection 
        and the Planning Department.
- The administrative position monitoring these fees keeps track of when 
        projects are approved and when fees are due. Another part of this position's 
        responsibilities is to look at building permit fees and make sure that 
        for application fees, the Planning Department is getting proper dues for 
        childcare, housing and open space.
Re: Enforcement Collection Items:
- The Department would be pleased to work with the City Attorney's office 
        on how to create a citation process. Staff will provide a status report 
        in the near future.
7. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of 
      Appeals
BOS -None
BOA
Jonas Ionin from staff represented the Zoning Administrator (ZA) at this 
        meeting.
Re: 412 Lombard Street (Telegraph Hill)
- The Commission heard this Discretionary Review on February 28, 2001 
        for an addition to a single-family house on a very small lot.
- The Zoning Administrator issued a variance decision on March 9, 2001.
- The department felt that it was appropriate in character. The Commission 
        made a few amendments: 1) modifications to the design, making it less 
        aggressive in it's modernism; 2) increased the amount of glass and reduced 
        the amount of stainless steel - more residential character; 3) added a 
        light well.
- On June 26, he the ZA wrote a letter of determination clarifying what 
        he felt the Commission had meant regarding the light well.
- The appeal was not for the letter of determination or the variance 
        but for the Building permit. The Board of Appeals upheld the Commissions' 
        decision but asked staff to look at the residential character and the 
        amount of glass vs. solid. There was also a request by the Board of Appeals 
        to do a plan check because there were questions raised by an adjacent 
        neighbor. This information will be reported back to the Board of Appeals.
8. Review and Comment on Planning Department's Budget, including Staffing 
      Allocations, Administrative Overhead and Budget Process.
Director Green gave a presentation on these issues.
REGULAR CALENDAR
9. (J. IONIN: (415) 558-6309)
WIRELESS FACILITIES SITING GUIDELINES BRIEFING- Commission briefing 
        and discussion on the 1996 WTS Siting Guidelines and consideration of 
        additional policies to supplement those guidelines.
SPEAKER(S):
Supervisor Tom Amiano
- Along with Supervisor McGoldrick, he initiated a discussion about a 
        wireless antenna moratorium in 2002.
- He used this opportunity to engage the industry in a mediated discussion 
        about how the siting guidelines should be modified.
- He thanked the industry, SNAFU and staff from Planning for the countless 
        hours put into this process.
- When they started there was very little agreement; and when it was 
        completed there was agreement on various issues including the need to 
        rewrite the guidelines. The product of this was a draft resolution urging 
        the Planning Department to modify the guidelines and to hire consultants 
        to rewrite the guidelines. After a series of hearings at the Board of 
        Supervisors, the Board requested feedback from the Planning Department 
        on the proposed resolution including timelines for implementation of the 
        various steps in the resolution. But due to the departure of the Planning 
        staff most familiar with this issue and other staff restraints, the Board 
        has not received comments as of yet.
- Mr. Samaha has identified a lack of budget resources as part of the 
        problem.
- He asked the Commission to schedule a hearing on the proposed resolution 
        with the goal of obtaining comments from the industry and from staff. 
        If the Commission develops a set of recommended amendments to the resolution, 
        he would introduce these to the Board of Supervisors.
- He asked the Commission to direct staff to develop cost estimates for 
        the work proposed under the resolution along with recommended funding 
        sources.
Bill Sanders - Deputy City Attorney
- The first part of the resolution recommended immediate changes to the 
        wireless guidelines: such as requiring community outreach meetings, requiring 
        alternate site analysis for preference 5 sites, requiring applicants to 
        pursue the most preferential rating, requiring annual reports or semiannual 
        reports, requiring applicant information in the check list, requiring 
        applicants to show compliance with city requirements at existing sites, 
        requiring applicants to indemnify the City against claims to environmental 
        affects to RF emissions, merging location preference 5 and 6 into a limited 
        preference category, removing certain buildings on small lots as preference 
        1 when they are publicly owned structures or as preference 2 when they 
        are co-location sites, limiting Conditional Use authorizations to 10 years 
        and requiring applicants to come back and show necessity.
- The resolution also asked the Planning Department to hire a consultant 
        or direct staff to study more detail changes to the guidelines: 1) additional 
        requirements for community outreach; 2) changes to the approval process 
        which would require industry to pay for consultants so the City could 
        examine their claims of necessity at limited preference sites; 4) further 
        changes to siting preferences including issues of whether landmarks should 
        be considered as limited preference sites; 5) developing guidelines to 
        address new technologies and equipment; 6) developing design guidelines; 
        and 7) developing standards for upgrades to existing facilities that were 
        approved as accessory uses or installed before adaptation of the guidelines.
Richard Lee - San Francisco Health Department
- He has been involved in this issue since 1996.
- He discussed the requirements for RF Radiation reports: 1) RF Ambient 
        Report -- this report is required before the site gets approved. The carrier 
        is required to provide a report drafted by a professional engineer; 2) 
        Project Implementation Report -- this report requires the measurement 
        of how much exposure radiation is coming from the antennas; 3) Status 
        Report -- done every two years.
Corey Alvin - Nextel Communications
- He is the zoning manager with most of the sites in San Francisco.
- Regarding compliance, they are actively working to make sure that their 
        sites are under compliance right from the very first location they built.
- He is here to briefly discuss the industries determined effort to adhere 
        to the City's Urban Design Guidelines and policies.
- He displayed photographs of how Nextel uses the most appropriate use 
        of materials and textures as well as architectural detail. Every site 
        is different and Nextel tries to design the facilities to be compatible 
        with that urban fabric.
Misako Hill - Cingular Wireless
- Each day over 250 911 calls are placed in San Francisco using wireless 
        technology.
- Wireless technology improves the City's 911 network and will continue 
        to save lives.
Jennifer Estes - Sprint
- She would like to discuss the issues of fairness and necessity.
- On the matter of fairness, it has been suggested that in certain portions 
        of the City there are more wireless facilities. However, the low power 
        and the subsequent limited range of antennas make it impossible to place 
        sites in some parts of the City to cover others.
- The second issue of necessity or desirability makes wireless sites 
        extremely important: they are used to keep families in contact with each 
        other; allows businesses to work more efficiently; and they are critical 
        in emergency situations.
- Sprint remains committed to adhering to the City's already comprehensive 
        guidelines, pledges to work with community members, SNAFU, Planning staff 
        and the Commission to enhance the guidelines.
Paul Albritton - AT&T Wireless
- He has been involved in this industry since 1986.
- He has been working with Supervisor Amiano for the past two years.
- AT&T Wireless supports Supervisor Amiano's resolution.
- The only suggestion he has is that the resolution does not include 
        the definition of necessity.
- He submitted a letter with points to prove this conclusion.
Gloria Talanowski
- She stated that the engineers from the carriers reporting to the Health 
        Department is a conflict of interest.
- She believes that neutral parties should be involved in this process.
- Dead birds are being found.
- She believes that the 300 foot radius is not sufficient.
Robert Garcia
- He feels that notification to the neighborhood is of utmost importance 
        here.
- He was not notified when various wireless antennas were installed.
- People need to know what is going on in their neighborhood.
Doug Lauringer - SNAFU
- The organization supports Supervisor Amiano's resolution.
- Many, many hours were put into this resolution.
- The goal is to amend the guidelines and not to update.
Tod Curtis
- He did not feel like there were any new guidelines so he is a bit disappointed.
- He did not hear anything about height regulations.
- He is concerned where these antennas are placed in relation to people's 
        homes.

10. 2002.0446E (B. HELBER: (415) 558-5968)
40-50 LANSING STREET (A.K.A. 35 GUY PLACE)-Appeal of a Preliminary 
        Mitigated Negative Declaration.The proposed project involves the 
        construction of a 155,000 gsf, 8-story residential building containing 
        82 dwelling units with 81 off-street parking spaces on 2 below-grade garage 
        levels and the demolition of the existing 56,250 gsf, 3-story light-industrial 
        building. The site is located at 40-50 Lansing Street, on Assessor's Block 
        3749, Lot 11, in the Rincon Hill area. The 20,205 sf site fronts on guy 
        Place and Lansing Street, between First and Second Streets. Two on-street 
        loading spaces are planned; one on Guy Place and one on Lansing Street. 
        The site is within a RC-4 (Residential Commercial Combined, High Density) 
        zoning district, the Rincon Hill Special Use Subdistrict and an 84-X height 
        and bulk district. The project would require variances from the following 
        provisions of the Planning Code: Freight Loading; dwelling unit exposure; 
        and from the Rincon Hill Special Use District; and Conditional Use authorization 
        for construction of a residential structure over 40 feet tall.
Preliminary Recommendation:  Uphold the Mitigated Negative Declaration.
(Continued from Regular Meeting of January 16, 2003)
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Andrew Junius
- The department, as always, has diligently and carefully reviewed the information, all the reports and has concluded that there is no evidence that this project would have a significant affect on the environment.
- The appellants have raised issues related to policy issues and process issues that are not at all related to the physical environment or to CEQA.
- The appellants have raised a lot of construction issues.
- The negative declaration satisfies the requirement of CEQA and he asks the Commission to uphold it.
(-) Tom Morley
- He has been a resident in this neighborhood for 40 years.
- He has seen the neighborhood evolve from mixed residential/light industrial to predominantly residential.
- The proposed development is vastly out of scale with the neighborhood.
(-) Paula Roth
- She lives on Lansing Street.
- She displayed pictures of the panoramic view of the neighborhood showing how the tall buildings have no horizontal visual effect and blend in beautifully.
- The proposed project is too large, too dense and overwhelms this tiny, little street.
(-) Cliff Roth
- He and his wife live and work on Lansing Street.
- He is against upholding the mitigated negative declaration because he is concerned with the access of emergency vehicles to this narrow "U" shaped street.
- There is a lot of night time activity because it's a club area.  There are also freeway entrances so there is traffic during the entire day and night.  This project would cause more traffic and block access to these emergency vehicles.
(-) Tule West
- This proposed project will have a negative impact on her building because she will be surrounded on two sides.
- This negative declaration is inadequate because it does address the geology concerns as the project will be constructed.
- The design and analysis of this project in the negative declaration and the geotechnical investigation report is based on the continued assumption that an encroachment permit may be required and that one will be obtained.
- She lives in the adjacent building and would like to know what guarantees there are that when the project begins there will be no settling, major slides, or subsiding.
(-) Patrick Malone
- He lives and has his law office on Lansing Street.
- People would not have even been here to discuss this project if it had not gone through plan checking.
(-) Ken Morrison
- He feels that the height and bulk of the proposed project have not been studied correctly.
- Aesthetically the building is wonderful, but the project is just in the wrong location.
(-) Robert Lundahl
- He is an artist and a film maker and he makes his living from visual materials.
- There is a misunderstanding because the heights of the adjacent buildings are misrepresented.
(-) Denyse Gross
- She is not opposed to the design of the building.  It just needs to be smaller and there are several safety issues.
- There are significant traffic problems already in the area.
- This project, if it continues as it is proposed, will double the number of residents and guests and will create a number of traffic problems.
(-) Mary Ann Robertson
- This project concerns her because the current building plans are intrusive and propose a project of monstrous proportions.
- The project will also "gobble" up street space for construction trucks and traffic.
- There will be loading and unloading that will impede traffic of emergency vehicles when needed.
- She requested that this project be denied.
(-) Sara O'Malley
- She lives on Lansing Street.
- There is not much green in this area so open space and greenery is a big thing for the neighborhood.
- This building will block sunlight to the area.
(-) Anna-Christina Newby
- Her unit receives a lot of light and she is concerned that the proposed project will block the sunlight.
- Because of the demolition there will be a lot of dust and debris that cause negative impacts.
- She asks that this building be reduced in size.
(-) Lesley Emmington Jones
- She does not live in the area, she lives in Berkeley.
- The Commission should be proud (that people are) fighting for a little remnant of early San Francisco history.
- Please don't let a mitigated negative declaration go through inadequately by not assessing what is there.   The topography of the hill will be cut away.  A huge building will dominate that hill.
(-) Andy Kazitzki
- He is the geotechnical engineer of the project.
- The investigation states that the subsurface conditions beneath the site in particular in that common property line is very favorable for this type of construction.
- Similar projects as the one currently proposed have been built successfully in even less favorable subsurface conditions.
(+) Kate White - Executive Director of the San Francisco Housing Coalition
- They took a look at this project and she urges the Commission to support the project.
- The coalition supported this project unanimously.
- This is a very well designed project.
(+) Bob Meyers - City Planning Consultant for the Project Sponsor
- This project will improve the neighborhood character.
- The project is the exact residential project the neighborhood envisioned.
- This is a very well designed and classy building.
- He has been asked by Green Belt Alliance to mention their support for this project.
(-) Albert Moreno
- He has been a resident of the area for almost 20 years.
- He moved there when the development of South of Market began.
- The demolition and construction of this project would be disastrous.
- Rincon Place is a wonderful place because it's historic.  A project like this would destroy it.
(+) John Eller - SB Architects
- There are a lot of misunderstandings surrounding this project.
- The development has in no way any detrimental affect on the trees one speaker was concerned about or the hill.
- The design will allow for common and open space.
- There is a benefit to the community that a gaping hole will be replaced.
(-) Dennise Esmacro
- She lives on Lansing Street.
- There are concerns about street parking and an increase in traffic.
(+) Paul Fisher - Project Designer
- He has lived on Lansing for many years.
- The neighborhood has a mixture of uses.
- Part of what remains is completely unrelated to any historical issues.
- It is disappointing to meet his former neighborhood and find himself on the wrong side of the street.
(+) Julia Ann Lauwey - Project Manager
- This project is a wonderful example of urban infill development.
- This is a wonderful project.
(+) David Murphy - Murphy, Burkury
- They are the structural engineers for the project.
- The soils engineering has already spoken about the geology of the area.
- Safety is his utmost concern.
- There is no danger for the adjacent buildings.
(+) Will Bailey - Project Manager - Cannon Constructors
- They have been very proactive in dealing with safety issues.
(+) Cris Harney - Project Sponsor
- There is more flexibility to getting an emergency vehicle on Lansing than on any other one-way street.
- The trees on this street will not be hurt.
- This is the largest parcel on the street.
(+) Douglas Perry
- He urges the Commission to approve the variances.
- The land use issues are well established by now.
- There are a variety of heights on this street.
- Housing is very important right now.
- People are moving away because they cannot find places to live.
(+) Chris Foley
- He is here to speak for GSTLLC, owner of the building across the street from the proposed project.
- They are in support of this project.  this is what the City of San Francisco needs.
- The city needs high density housing that is close to transportation.
(+) Theodore Brown
- He owns property on Fremont Street.
- He feels that the opposition is not really interested in the project.
- This building will go up very quickly and there will be dust and inconvenience but that happens with any construction.
(+) Ellen Reich
- She welcomes a project like this since it improves the quality of life in the neighborhood.
- If someone does not want traffic, then why live next to the Bay Bridge.
- She has been very happy living there.
- She helps any project like this one because it will bring amenities.

Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions
(Continued from Regular Meeting of January 16, 2003)
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Andrew Junius - Reuben and Alter - Representing Project Sponsor
- Every project is based on the General Plan.  In this case it's the Rincon Hill Plan.

- The San Francisco Housing Coalition is in support of this project as well as other organizations.
(-) Patrick Malone
- He would like to point out that they will appeal the decision of the Commission on the preliminary negative declaration.
- There is no extraordinary circumstances for obtaining variances.
(-) Robert Lundahl
- He is disturbed with the Planning Department stating that there will be no negative impacts from this project when there will be.
- The day that there is a fire will be the day that the alley will be blocked--which will cause disruption.
Re:  Appeal of the decision of the Commission Upholding the Preliminary Negative Declaration
Andrew Junius
- This is very frustrating and very shocking for him.
- He questions the validity of the appeal since it was filed after hours.

(Continued from Regular Meeting of February 6, 2003)
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Steve Williams - Representing 5 of the DR requestors
- There are 41 people who live around these homes and only 2 support this project.
- The buildings are incompatible with the neighborhood since they are too tall.
- The issues that the neighbors have are to: 1) match the light wells, 2) reduce the depth into the rear open space and 3) reduce the height.
- Five doors down the exact same analysis came from the Department in a nearly identical project.  He obviously thought that the same recommendations would be given and they were not.  That project is now under construction.  Whey is this a different standard.
(-) Cindy Reuter
- Five doors down, staff required that the developer reduce it's rear wall to be the average of the adjacent neighbor's rear walls on the second story and on the third story.
- The proposed projects do not comply with the Residential Design Guidelines.
- These buildings are twice as large as the average three-story home on the block.
- These buildings are just too tall, too deep and too long and too big.  The buildings do not step down the hill either.
(-) June Chun
- She lives across the street from the proposed project.
- The homes are just too large and they overwhelm the surrounding homes and neighborhood.
- She is just asking to have this project reduced in size.
(-) Lex Fukumitzu
- He lives on 28thStreet.
- He wasn't excited about the construction of the two homes because of the parking issue.
- Almost 80% of the neighbors who live on this block have written to the Planning Department in opposition of this project because of its size.
- Upper Noe Neighbors and Friends of Noe Valley wanted the Project Sponsor to work with the neighbors.
- There is support from Assemblyman Leland Yee and well as Assemblyman Mark Leno.
(-) Rene Pittin
- She lives on 28thStreet.
- The project sponsor made promises to the neighbors that he did not keep, for example:  that light wells would match, 3rdfloor setback, no higher than uphill roof and no higher than project sponsors rain gutter, deeper excavation below grade, dwellings would step down the hill, flat roofs, and that the homes would not extend past neighbors' rear walls.
- Neighborhood character, neighborhood concerns and good neighborliness are not part of this project.
- She would like to ask the Commission to maintain the character of this neighborhood.
(-) Dick and Jerry Meister
- They moved into this neighborhood because of all the sunlight that falls upon this neighborhood.
- They receive a lot of sunlight into their home.
- The design of the new homes showed a huge wall that would cast deep shadows into his home and onto his garden.
- The first plans that they viewed, kept changing without having consulted the neighbors.
(-) Michelle Vignes
- She lives on the east part of the proposed project.
- It is very important for her to have peace and light in her home.  She is a photographer and needs to work quietly in her office.
- With the proposed home, it would make her office quite dark.  She only needs one dark room.
- She has lived thirty years in the neighborhood and has seen it change but nothing like these monster homes.
(-) Joe Butler - Project Architect
- He would like to ask the Commission to bring an additional 13 feet out of the second and third story so that the rear walls average with the adjacent structures.
(-) Randall Zielinski
- He lives in Noe Valley and is a member of the Friends of Noe Valley.
- He read a letter from the organization who is neutral on this project.  They just ask that all neighbors work together on this to resolve all the issues.
(-) Tom Mogensen
- He is Vice President of Upper Noe Neighbors.
- The organization as well as the Planning Department received a letter from Supervisor Bevin Dufty of District 8 inviting everyone to participate in resolving a contentious problem of oversized homes.
- The Supervisor would like to have this problem resolved by participating in this project and finding a solution now.
(-) Julie Christensen
- She read a letter from the Bankorft Library stating how important it is to have Ms. Veene finish her photographical work by having a solution to the proposed homes and that they will not impact negatively into her home.
(-) Nancy Levine
- She lives on 28thStreet.
- There is inconsistency with this project and the rest of the homes on this block.
(-) Pauline Shulman
- She lives on 28thStreet
- She respectfully asks that the Commission take Discretionary Review on this project.
(-) Diane McCarney
- She is trying to make her neighborhood balanced and hopes that everyone can come to a compromise.
(-) Stan Lekach
- He lives around the corner from the proposed project.
- There are a lot of homes who have gardens and trees.  If these houses were to be built as proposed, it would be a huge imposition and impact negatively on the adjacent homes.

- She lives on Duncan Street.
- She hopes that the Commission will approve a Discretionary Review on this project.
(-) Del Martin
- She is here to support the Discretionary Review requestors.

- He is not asking that the development cease, he is just asking for consistency in the neighborhood.
(-) Klaus Wirsing
- He lives 25 feet above the proposed building site.
- he made additions to his home a few years ago and excavated also to keep the roof line of the adjacent homes equal.
- This is something that the project sponsor could do to he proposed home.
(-) Patrick McLane
- He and his wife are the most recent residents of this neighborhood.  They came to this neighborhood because of all the open space and air.
- They totally respect the right to develop property.  They just ask that the property be developed that is in keeping with the adjacent buildings, that is of a scale that is consistent with the slope and that it's in keeping with the local neighbors.
(+) Steven Aiello - Project Designer
- HE is proposed two units where only one exists.
- San Francisco has a variety of homes and neighborhoods.
- Both of the adjacent neighbors' homes project further back than the buildings around them.
- He is only developing 50% of the total developable volume on the downhill volume and 57 1/2% on the uphill building.
- Both building are below the required height limit.
(+) Mary Sangiacomo
- She lives on 28thStreet.
- She supports this project since the project sponsor will take a property which probably does not comply with building requirements and develop it into two very reasonably sized homes in a City which is in need for single-family housing.
- She and her husband have reviewed the plans and agree with the design.
- She hopes that the Commission will approve the project.
(+) Andrew Junius
- There are smaller houses on the block but there are also larger houses on the block.  Just because one house is larger than the adjacent one does not constitute Discretionary Review.
- There are no substantial issues here to justify Discretionary Review.
(+) Val Rabichev - Structural Engineer
- The foundation will be lower than the uphill neighbor.
- This construction will be conducted in a safe manner with all the requirements of the San Francisco building code.
- The changes requested by the Discretionary Review requestors would make the construction of the homes riskier.
(+) Phillip Whitehead
- He prepared the soundness report and he is available for any questions.
(+) Claire Piltcher

- He is not a developer and is just trying to build a house for his growing family.
- He and his wife want to remain living in Noe Valley.
- They plan to have about 4 or 5 members of his family live in the proposed homes.
- There are dozens of trees which will be removed and allow more and clearer views for the neighbors.
- If this building were across the street or lower down the block, they would probably not be here.
- They have made numerous changes to the design to accommodate the neighbor's issues.
(+) Maureen McFAdden
- She and her husband would like to remain in Noe Valley and enlarge their home.
- The project falls far within the San Francisco Building Code.
- Her husband has made several revisions to the design of the project.
- She hopes that the Commission will approve the design as is.
(+) Margaret McFadden
- She is the sister of the project sponsor.
- She has letters from neighbors who could not attend the meeting but who support the project sponsor.
(+) Joel Baumgardner
- He is an architect and has known the project sponsor for many years.
- The project is well designed and is consistent with the neighborhood and the residential design guidelines.

(+) Catherine McCall
- She is here in support of the project sponsor.

- He just sees people worried about their views and misusing a process.

(+) Bob Powell
- He supports the project as proposed since it will be a great addition to the neighborhood.
- He read a letter from a member of the Upper Noe Valley Neighbors Association who is in support of the project.
(+) Heather Aiello
- She read a letter from a neighbor who is in support of the project but could not come to the meeting.
(+) John Dooling
- He has looked at the plans and finds that they are well designed and thought out.
- The proposed project will be a benefit to the neighborhood.
- The plans comply with the building code and zoning ordinance.
(+) Dorothy Walsh
- All her children have had to move out of San Francisco because they could not afford a house here.
- The proposed project needs to have both children's bedrooms and master bedrooms on the same floor.
- She supports the plans as they have been proposed.
(+) Gerry Kiegan
- He is here to urge the Commission not to take Discretionary Review on this project and approve the plans with modification.
(+) Sean Moran
- He is in support of this project.
- The old dwelling in question is uninhabitable and the proposed new construction are well under the height limit and the size and scale are compatible with the other homes on the block.
- It is time to let this project go forward.
(+) Vincent Walsh
- He was involved in the rezoning of the City back in the `70s.  They had a lot of conversations about the size, lot and building envelopes.  It was specifically intended that single-family homes could be built on 70% of the lot since families should be able to build the kind of homes they felt they needed.
- The proposed home is not unreasonable in size.
(+) Matt Dooling
- He lives in Noe Valley for many years.
- He read a letter from a neighbor who is in support of the project.
(+) Joe O'Donoghue
- The opposition is trying to say that the project is not designed with the residential design guidelines in mind.
- The project sponsor has a growing family and he should have the right to build this project to adapt to his growing family.
- Change is not bad.
(+) Sululagi Palega
- He has been involved in Noe Valley for more than 30 years.
- This neighborhood has always been about good changes and families and children.
- All the houses are different sizes, different shapes and have families with different nationalities.
(+) Joe Cassidy
- He has built a few buildings in Noe Valley.
- There are mostly two and three story buildings near the area where this home is proposed.
- He feels that there has mass negative hysteria just because the Friends of Noe Valley wrote a letter opposed to this project when the members did not even meet about it.
- He feels that the Commission should disregard the arguments from the opposition and approve the project as proposed.
