On Director's Leave:
SPEAKER(S):
Tim Tosta - Steefel, Levitt and Weiss
- He was at a conference last week at Harvard.
- It was a stunning experience for the community of which our common interest bounds together.
- He had a chance to have dinner with Gerald Green and it was an opportunity to see the depth and quality of the people in the program.
- It is an honor to the City that Mr. Green was chosen for this Fellowship.
- It is a wonderful environment where Mr. Green is right now.
- He hopes that the Commission will look at all these aspects of the situation and hopes the City recognizes that.
Jeffrey Heller - Heller and Mannus Architects
- He is part of a task force being put together between the AIA and SPUR, which is looking at how to make the planning process better; what recommendations can be put forth to the Commission in making the process move better.
- The flow of things while the Commission is making the decisions is reassuring knowing that Mr. Badiner is Acting Director.
Nilka Julio - Representing Local 21
- She appreciates the opportunity to speak on this issue.
- Budgetary measures have impacted the Planning Department.
- The membership of Local 21 is contributing
- She does not question the leave of Mr. Green or the ability of Mr. Badiner; she questions the impact to the budget and the department.
Kate White - Housing Action Coalition

- Why is Director Green taking a leave if he will not have a job when the new City Administration takes over in January?

RESOLUTION: 16666
On the Department's Budget:
SPEAKER(S):
Kate White - Housing Acting Coalition
- She realizes that the public needs to talk to the Supervisors regarding the Planning Department's budget.
- The Planning Department is a key department for the City.
- Planning is needed for housing, neighborhoods and to keep the City livable.
- Without funding, there is a serious problem.
- It is very disconcerting that no money went to the department this year.
- Creative ways to find fees need to be found.  Of course, the fees cannot be so high that developers will not want to do anything in San Francisco.
Marilyn Amini
- The material for the work plan was not available until this past Monday.
- The information that was displayed today was not provided to the public.
- She feels that the Department has problems on the budget because of these issues.
- If the community as a whole had been involved in the planning of the Housing Element, there would be fees allocated for the needs.
- Things are being proposed that are not in sync with the community.
Sue Hestor
- She agrees with Ms. White.
- Fee recovery needs to be done for people who use area plans.
- There have been too many spot rezoning in areas that are being considered for rezoning.
- It costs more on staff when projects that could have been done in 6 months is done in three years.
- All the developers are getting their projects and not the residents of San Francisco.
ACTION: On calendar for discussion only.  No action taken.
9. 2003.0042T (P. LORD: (415) 558-6311)
MAJOR EXTERIOR ALTERATION NOTIFICATION- consideration of an Ordinance amending the San Francisco Planning Code by amending Section 311 and 312 to require expanded public notice for major exterior alteration projects; requiring the Building and Planning Departments to issue implementing regulation within 90 days and report to the Board of Supervisors on the effectiveness of the ordinance no later than nine months thereafter; and adopting findings.
Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions
(Continued from Regular meeting of August 21, 2003)
SPEAKER(S):
Bruce Bonacker
- He is an architect and works on remodeling houses.
- He has been a member of the task force that is working on this item for a long time.
- Regarding re-notices on work being done on approved projects, he would like to not have that aspect of the legislation struck as has been recommended by Mr. Lord.
- If this aspect is not struck it would not cause a burden to the department.
- If the Commission feels that it should be struck, then the Acting Zoning Administrator should make the determination of noticing or not.
John Schlesinger
- Mr. Lord has pointed out some of the most important merits of the legislation.
- This legislation provides important information to the appropriate parties.
- He is also a member of the task force.
Pat Buscovich
- He is also on the task force.
- He wanted to expand the notice and create a fuller package so that everyone would understand what is going on.
- The Zoning Administrator should deal with minor changes and interested parties should deal with moderate changes only.
- This is a very critical portion of this legislation.
Jeremy Paul
- He has spent dozens of hours on this legislation.
- The first issue they dealt with was unlawful demolitions.
- He is strongly in favor of increased notification.  The more information goes out in advance, is better to solve problems that perhaps will not be able to be undone.
Alice Barkley
- The problem she has with this ordinance is page 15, lines 15 to 19 because this legislation will place a burden on homeowner occupancy.
- When something is already under construction and needs to be changed, it should not require re-notification.  That will place an extreme burden on a homeowner.
Sue Hestor
- She has a problem with the change of going to an 18-month period implementation on dealing with the Department of Building Inspection.
- This should not be delayed anymore.
- This is a doable plan.
Marilyn Amini
- This legislation is about expanding notice.  The code requires a 300-foot radius on a project.
- The building code gives earlier notice.
- She is glad to hear that the Department is not suggesting 150-foot radius.
- It is important to notice neighbors of changes done to 2/3 of the structure.
- A lot of changes are done one site at projects.
- She has a question on what determines minor or moderate changes.
- The information on this legislation was not available to the public in a timely manor in order to give the public time to respond.  Commissioner Feldstein is always announcing that she receives information in a short amount of time before a hearing.
ACTION: Approved with the following language modification:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT, the Commission approves the Planning Code Amendments as presented in the draft ordinance signed by the City Attorney dated April 9, 2003 attached to this resolution as Exhibit A and recommends to the Board of Supervisors that the proposed Ordinance be adopted with minor modifications.

The Department shall not approve a modified permit until 10 days after the additional notice is given.  The length of required waiting period after approval of the modified permit and notification procedures may be reduced at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator.
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT, the Commission further recommends that the Board of Supervisors recognize the need for new staff and budget necessary to implement the requirements of this ordinance.
THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT, the Commission recommends that the Board of Supervisors modify the language on page 12 line 4 to replace the "and" separators between "demolition," "new construction," and "alteration" with "or" as the separator and modify the new Section 5 on page 23 of the draft ordinance to read as follows:
Section 5.  Adoption of Rules and Regulations.

This ordinance shall apply only to those building permit applications filed after the issuance of administrative regulations or within 90 days of the effective date of this ordinance, which ever is sooner.

- She requests that the building be reduced in height and that there be no roof deck parapet or solid wall.

- The proposed building is out of scale and out of character.  It towers as much as 24 feet above the neighboring homes and will block sunlight to the surrounding homes.
(-) Dr. Steven Muchnick
- There will be two units and seven bedrooms in the proposed structure,  causing more traffic on that street.
- There are no parking spaces available on that block so there is no space for additional parking.
- Blocking the Moraga steps will be an impact because there are many people who use those steps.
