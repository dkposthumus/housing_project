SPEAKER (S):
Supervisor Aaron Peskin
- Gave an general analysis of proposed code amendments

Nancy Ho-Belli
-    Opposed revisions to the Planning Code
Noel Lawrence
- Opposed legislation
Gary Gavello
- Opposed legislation
Michelle Donnelly
- Opposes this measure because it is too restrictive.  We would have to apply for any sort of special permit or authorization for office use.  It will present an financial hardship on property owners, especially in these current economic time.
Don Gressman
- Opposed legislation
Sarah Stocking
- This is a very good long-term strategy for preserving an area that it is so unique to San Francisco.  It is not just the historic quality of the buildings, but also the nature of the retail environment.  With better economic times, it will expand.

SEC. 249.24. Jackson Square Special Use District
In order to provide for the protection and enhancement of specialty retail and antique store uses in the Jackson Square area, there shall be established the Jackson Square Special Use District as designated on Sectional Map No. 1 Su of the Zoning Map.  The boundaries of this special use district shall be coterminous with the boundaries of the Jackson Square Historic District as established by Appendix B to Article 10 of this Code and further described in section 3 of that Appendix.  The following provisions shall apply within the Jackson Square Special Use District.
a) Purposes.  These controls are intended to protect and enhance the unique retail character of the special use district.  All decisions of the Planning Commission and Department for the establishment of ground floorand basementuse shall be guided by the following factors:
1) Continuation and enhancement of existing ground floorand basementretail uses are of critical importance to the character of the District and displacement of such uses should be discouraged;
2) Attraction and retention of similar new retail establishments that conform with the character of this District should be encourage; and
3) Uses that greatly intensify the density of employment have a negative impact on the provision of neighborhood services, traffic circulation, and limited on- and off-street parking.
b) Controls.
1) General.  The provisions of the C-2 use district as established in section 210.2 and applicable provisions of the Garmet Shop Special Use District (section 236) and the Washington-Broadway Special Use District (section 239) shall prevail except as provided in photographs 2) and 3) below.
2) Conditional Uses.  Office uses set forth in sections 219(a), (b), (c), and (d) at the ground floor are subject to conditional use authorization pursuant to section 303 of this Code, provided, however, that building lobbies, entrances, and exits to and from the basement ground floor, or upper floors, and other reasonably sized common areas at the ground floor shall be permitted without conditional use authorization.  In addition to the findings required under section 203(c) for conditional use authorization, the Commission shall make the following findings:
a) The use shall be necessary to preserve the historic resource and no other use can be demonstrated to preserve the historic resource.
b) The use shall be compatible with, and shall enhance, the unique retail character of the District.
3) Prohibited Uses.

RESOLUTION NO. 16577/16578
14.                                     (C. NIKITAS:  (415) 558- 6306)
RESIDENTIAL DEMOLITION POLICY- Consideration of revisions to the Planning Commission's Residential Demolition Policy.  This report provides an overview of current procedures for Planning Department review of residential demolition applications that do not require Conditional Use authorization. Revisions to criteria relating to specific General Plan Policies are suggested. Changes to procedures for determinations of building "soundness" are proposed. This is an informational presentation, with no action to be taken by the Planning Commission. The Commission may adopt specific policies, procedures, and criteria regarding residential demolitions at one or more future hearings, following a period of review and public comment.
SPEAKER (S):
Pat Lackey
- The most important things would be for people that work in the City, be able to afford to live in the City.
Jim Salinas
- Believes it is important to refurbish these properties.  Many are made in architectural designs that are important to San Francisco and were constructed in an era that workmanship was valued.
- By tearing down these small more affordable properties, you allow the developers to make huge profits and build units that are outside the range of the average San Franciscan.
- Please do not let profit become the motive for tearing down pieces of San Francisco, that can house families, seniors, renters--thereby keeping our families here in San Francisco rather than have them relocate to San Pablo, Pittsburgh, Vallejo, etc.
Addison Strong
- Affordability is an obvious concern for anyone who lives in San Francisco
Jeremy Paul
- The concept of demolition versus alteration is an artificial barrier.  There is no difference in process between a major alteration and a full demolition.
-
Marilu Lascari
- Housing demolition should not be made easier and there should be more regulations.
Russell Murphy
- It is hard to bring some of these old houses up to date with the structural standards in San Francisco today.
David Silverman
- Report is very thorough but it does not mention a very important feature that should be taken into account:  what is the age of the house?  This should be considered independent of the question of soundness.
- There is a suggestion in the report that increases the threshold of an upgrade cost to 75% in cases that are called owner neglect.  He has handled quite few of these cases and can tell you that there is no agreement on how to distinguish owner neglect from normal aging or construction deficiency.  This is an area that needs more analysis and consideration.
Ahmad Larizadeh
- Supports revisions to the criteria related to specific General Plan Policies.
Steve Vettel
- One of the replacement policy in the draft, one of the things you look at it is that the replacement building provides family housing--that becomes a plus.
- Others special-needs housing identified in the General Plan as high need is elderly housing and group housing for mentally disabled adults.
Daniela Kirshenbaum
- This report is a big step in the right direction
- Neighborhood character is something that we always we need to think about, and it is spelled out in this report.
- It is hard to find opportunities where demolitions have enhanced neighborhood character.
Pat Buscovich
- A lot of these buildings were built a long time ago and they are not functional today.
- We need to look at single-family homes differently than multi-family housing.
- Reports need to be done by people who do not have a financial interest, but an interest in the design so you can get an un-bias report.
Joe O'Donoghue
- In the 1960s and 1970s the rate of demolition was .3%, 1500 to 1900 units per year. Today the rate of demolition is about .4% and single family homes today are .01% to .03% of that.
Charlie Varon
-Let's be very careful when we think about demolition.  Think about the architectural heritage, historical heritage, or the cultural heritage, that we are taking away from our kids.
Hiroshi Fukuda
- We need to create a more efficient and accurate demolition system to be able to preserve our buildings and neighborhoods.
Gary Gee
- The criteria for a minimum  two-bedroom units is maybe too strict.  It does not allow flexibility.
Dick Millet
- Something has to be done.  We need to go back to 1300 sq. ft.  This will give 3 bedrooms and 2 baths and families might be able to live there, instead of these great luxury homes [where most of them can't].
Shawn Gorman
- Design is really a separate issue from demolition.  It is tied more often than not to cases coming before you as a result of a demolition occurring before the residential design can be approved.
Patricia Vaughey
- Concerned about the Commission voting on this, until after the demolition issue is settled at the Board of Supervisors.  Much of what is in this seems to be what is in front of the Board of Supervisors, and some the wording seems to be extremely controversial.
- Believes that you might be breaking CEQA by doing a policy like this and not doing it jointly with the Housing Element.
Kepa Acknowsky
- Would like to request that this type of study expand to include other zoning areas in San Francisco.
Sue Hestor
- Regarding Recommendation 13:  Someone buys a property that has a failure of maintenance from the prior owner.  That could not work, because 1) there will be collusive transactions to avoid; 2) property would be priced as a tear down.  If you want to keep the land value down so that someone who has the hope of buying a condemned building, you have to take the value for rehabbing a demolition out of that property.  You are not going to do it.
Joe Buttler
- The soundness report formula that is currently in place could be reasonably applied to the majority of buildings that are more than 50 years of age, due to the code upgrade, seismic and otherwise.  A broader context view of demolition within the neighborhood should be considered, and those parts in the master plan excluded from the summary of the demolition policy today, should be included.
Judy Berkowitz
- One of the things that she is particularly concerned about is the 2/3 of the interior demolition without notice.
Alice Barkley
- In terms of the old buildings, it mentions in the report that the environmental evaluation would hold out those buildings with architectural merit and historical significance.
Marilyn Amini

15. 2002.1267DD (D. JONES:  (415) 558- 6477)
686 28THSTREET- north side between Douglass and Diamond Streets, Lot 015 in Assessor's Block 6605 - Request for Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application No. 2002.10.02.8026, proposing to construct a three-story rear horizontal extension, and to modify the existing pitched roof to a flat roof towards the rear of the three-story single-family dwelling located in an RH-1 (Residential, House, One-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the building permit as submitted.
(Continued from Regular Hearing of May 1, 2003)
SPEAKER (S):
David Aranika, First Discretionary Review Requestor
- There are some exceptional and extraordinary circumstances surrounding this project.
- One of his concerns with the proposed project has to do with the second and third floors of the building and the depth of the building.
- Their air and light to adjacent properties is significantly diminished.
- Asked the Commission to consider the impact to his light, space and visual [view].
Joe Buttler, Representing Second Discretionary Review Requestor
- The overlapping of these four corner lots and their shallow buildings meets the minimum standards of the Planning Code.  If applied to the sponsor's application, it would not adequately protect the light and air of the three other homes.
Dick Meister
- What it amounts to is the question of fairness and equity.
- It violates the privacy and light of two neighbors.
Gerry Meister
- Would like the same standards that have been previously al\pplied in the neighborhood be applied on this project.
- Minimal reduction inside has been asked for.  It would be a good service to the neighborhood if it is granted.
James Haire
- The subject house is the oldest on this part of the hill.  In essence, it has some historic value.
- Strongly supports the project.
Jim Ruben, representing Project Sponsor
- The rear yard, that has been retained is 40%, not 25%.
- This is a modest extension at most.
- There is no way either the first and second floor could impact either of the Discretionary Review requestors.
- The project sponsor wants to preserve a house that obviously contributes to the character of the neighborhood.
- Opposing the retention of the house and its renovation in a way that is a practical solution is not good to anybody right now.
- Asked the Commission to not take Discretionary Review and follow staff`s recommendations.
BillPashelincky, Architect of the Project
- Gave a general description of the project
Mary Sangiacomo
- Always been her dream to restore a Victorian home and make it her family home.
- This home has a very rich history.
- The house cannot presently be occupied.  To make it livable for her family, they needs to extend the rear to modestly increase the size of the building.
James McFadden
- Strongly supports this project.
Steven Aiello
- There is a well established pattern of three-story buildings on this block.
- These people are saving a home that could easily be demolished.
- They are keeping the roof down instead of doing a cathedral-style roof in the back.
ACTION:Did not take Discretionary Review and approved as submitted.
AYES: Bradford Bell;  Antonini;  Boyd; Feldstein; S. Lee;  W. Lee
ABSENT:Hughes
16. 2003.0312D  (M. SNYDER: (415) 575-6891)
761 KANSAS STREET- east side between 19th Street and 20th Street, Lot 17 in Assessor's Block 4073 - Request for Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application No. 2002.10.25.0003 proposing to construct a vertical and rear horizontal addition, as well as a new front facade.  The property is within an RH-2 (House, Two-family) District, and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation:  Take Discretionary Review and approve the project with modifications.
(Continued from Regular Hearing of May 1, 2003)
SPEAKER (S):
Lou and Ruth Goldheimer, Discretionary Review Requestors
- Supports their new neighbor's need to expand and enhance their home
- Has agreed that a third floor on top of the second will provide them with the space they want.
- Would like to emphasis their two goals for this Discretionary Review: 1) The rear depth of the house be modified to be in line with and comparable to the adjacent neighbors; 2) the mass and volume of the house be mitigated by progressive setbacks that would preserve some neighbors access to sun, air, and views.
Katherine Krebs
- Concerned about the preservation of the beauty and character of their neighborhood.
-The volume and mass of the proposed building must be mitigated by the use of progressive setbacks so it is comparable with the rest of the neighborhood.
Rose O'Leary (Spoke on behalf of Rubin Sutherland)
- Supports Discretionary Review
Philip E. LeMaster
- This building does not fit the neighborhood.
- The style looks like it belongs in an intercity office complex of cement, glass, and steel in the shape of a box.
Pam Davis
- This alteration does not add to the housing stock.  There is no justification for tripling the size of the home.
- This is a single-family dwelling.
- The builders are not planning to make this home two units.
- There is absolutely no advantage to the City and the taxpayers for a house of this dimension.
Robert Graham
- This project is totally out of character with the neighborhood.
Michelle Garside
- Asked the Commission to use their power and do what it says in the Planning Code.
- We would like to preserve our neighborhood.  It is a very special place because we love how we live there.  We do not live big.
Judith Leash
- Urged the Commission to consider the guidelines adopted in 1989 and to review neighborhood comparability.
Gregg Goddard
-     Supports Discretionary Review.
Miguelina Perez
- Supports Discretionary Review.
Ben Goldheimmer
- The proposed new home is not in keeping with the sizes of the homes currently on this block.
- The project designer is proposing a home that is nearly 4.000 square feet, while the other three-story structures are approximately 2500 square feet.  This is 1500 square feet larger than the norm.
Garry Sinclair
- This project will greatly impact their garden.
- They would lose their privacy.
Kris Gardner
- I'm here today to support the residential design guidelines.
- The project before you proposes a design that is in conflict with the residential design guidelines in the following area:  the addition proposes an extension into the rear yard that is greater than a garden level floor.
- The proposed rear yard extension is out of alignment with the adjoining neighbors to the south as well as to the north.
Catherine Wayland
- Concerned about retaining the integrity of the Potrero Hill Neighborhood.
- Concerned about building Monster Homes that will impact the sun, air, and light of the neighborhood.
Tito Patri
- Urged the Commission to require the proponents to go back to the drawing board and design something that is neighborly, not necessarily just according to the rules.
Dick Millet
- The design is beautiful, it is just in the wrong place.  The character is wrong for this place, and it is not in the single-family zone.
Steve Williams, representing John and Triny Artol
- How is this not a demolition?  Look at the plans.  The Department has to explain how this is not a demolition when all you are saving is just a little bit of a wall.
- Even what we proposed to you today would at least make it a major alteration.
- Urged the Commission, as part of the Discretionary review, to put this scheme back in place.
Joel Yodowitz
- The Discretionary Review requestors conveniently omitted from their drawings the fact they have a rear yard cottage and 100% lot coverage themselves. They also miss-categorized the remaining rear yards in the block.
- The proposed project comes in about 66 feet.  As you can see, several of the other buildings are larger than that. There is no specific continuance of space.
- The proposed house would be about 3480 square feet, not 4100 square feet as the Discretionary Review requestors mentioned tonight.
- The project impact on light and air has been mis-represented.
- The subject property is north of the Goldheimers.  It will have a very minimal impact. It will only extended about an additional 13 feet into their year yard.
Robin Coleen, Project Sponsor
- Their renovation respects setbacks.  And because of her love of gardening, this features lots of landscaping elements in the front and rear of the house.
- This house was conceived as a solar house.  We hoped that the energy efficiency of it would inspire more on the hill to use solar power.
- In our design, we made considerable efforts to accommodate our neighbors--lapping off corners, preserving setbacks, moving a balcony to preserve one of the neighbors' privacy, lowering solar panels, etc.  In fact, we have made many compromises over the last nine months through many meetings.
David Coleen, Project Sponsor
- This is an old house that has two substandard additions.  In the structural evaluations we found out that these additions are about to fall down.  We will take them down before they fall down.  The main part of the house will stay.  We have an addition proposed in the back and an additional floor added to the top.
- We have been through a lengthy process here.  We have been working with our neighbors for nine months now.  We had over thirty design meetings with neighbors including the Goldheimers.
- We are proposing to renovate a house completely within the rules.
Chris Thompson
- He is in support of the builders of this building largely because he is simpatehic to the ardorous nature of the task at hand--trying to get a project approved in the City.
Peter Eurenever
- Supports the project because it adds to the energy on the hill.
-     The design fits in with the neighborhood.
Babette Drefke
- Found that all the proposed improvements are within the Planning Code.  Therefore it is necessary to side with those who are trying to improve the neighborhood.
-     Urged the Commission to approve the application.
ACTION:Approved as modified:
- Provide a consistent three-foot side setback for the last nine-feet of depth of the addition on its southern side; and
- Reduce the height of the clearstory by one-foot and increase its setback from the front building wall by three-feet.

2146 45TH AVENUE- east side between Quintara and Rivera Avenues.  Assessor's Block 2173 Lot 040 - Request for Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application No. 2002.1204.2727, to construct a two story horizontal addition to the rear of the existing one story, single family in an RH-1 (Residential, House, 1 Family) District, and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation:  Take Discretionary Review and Modify the Project
SPEAKER (S):
Tana Hall
- The proposal as it stands, is very insensitive to the neighborhood and increases the value and enjoyment of one property at the expense of all the others on the block.  It is also at the expense of the character of the neighborhood.
- The height is too tall for the area.  The bulk and its encroachment into the rear yard impacts open space.  They are building to the full legal limit of the property.  They lack good neighbor features to mitigate the negative impacts, which are increased density, lost open space, views and privacy.
Kelly Stanley  (read a letter from Ellen Mary James-Smith)
- Privacy, view, quality of open space, increased density in the neighborhood, and the worry that such a large building would be used for multiple families are all immediate concerns.
Dennis Young, Architect, representing Project Sponsor
- Gave a general description of the project.
Helen Chiung, Project Sponsor
- Needs to expand her house, to be able to raise her children.
ACTION:Approved with modifications:
