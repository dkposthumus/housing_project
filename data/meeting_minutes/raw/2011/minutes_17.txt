Parkmerced Project; 3711 Nineteenth Avenue-Certification of the Final EnvironmentalImpact 
Report- The project site is located on about 152 acres of land adjacent to 
Lake Merced (Assessors Block 7303-001, 7303-A-001, 7308-001, 7309-001, 
7309-A-001, 7310-001, 7311-001, 7315-001, 7316-001, 7317-001, 7318-001, 
7319-001, 7320-003, 7321-001, 7322-001, 7323-001, 7325-001, 7326-001, 7330-001, 
7331-004, 7332-004, 7333-001, 7333-003, 7333-A-001, 7333-B-001, 7333-C-001, 
7333-D-001, 7333-E-001, 7334-001, 7335-001, 7336-001, 7337-001, 7338-001, 
7339-001, 7340-001, 7341-001, 7342-001, 7343-001, 7344-001, 7345-001, 
7345-A-001, 7345-B-001, 7345-C-001, 7356-001, 7357-001, 7358-001, 7359-001, 
7360-001, 7361-001, 7362-001, 7363-001, 7364-001, 7365-001, 7366-001, 7367-001, 
7368-001, 7369-001, and 7370-001). The Proposed Project would increase 
residential density, provide new commercial and retail services, modify transit 
facilities, and improve utilities within the site. A new Pre K-5 school and day 
care facility, a fitness center, and new open space uses, would also be 
provided. About 1,683 of the existing apartments located in 11 tower buildings 
would be retained. Over a period of approximately 20 years, the remaining 1,538 
existing apartments would be demolished and replaced, and an additional 5,679 
net new units would be added, resulting in a total of about 8,900 units on the 
site. The transportation system modifications would include rerouting the 
existing Muni Metro M Ocean View line through the development. Infrastructure 
improvements would include the installation renewable energy sources, such as 
wind turbines and photovoltaic cells.  The Proposed Project would require 
amendments to the San Francisco Planning Code and theSan Francisco General 
Plan.The Planning Code amendments would change the Height and Bulk 
District Zoning Map and would add a Special Use District (SUD) applicable to the 
entire Project Site.  A Development Agreement is also proposed, which would be 
accompanied by the proposedParkmerced Design Standards and Guidelineswith specific development guidelines. The transportation improvements would 
require approval of the San Francisco Municipal Transit Authority, the 
California Public Utilities Commission, and Caltrans. The Draft EIR identified 
potentially significant, unavoidable environmental impacts on aesthetics, 
historic architectural resources, transportation, noise, air quality, wind and 
biological resources.
Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the Final Environmental Impact
