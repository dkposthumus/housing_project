950 Mason Streetâ Fairmont Hotel Project-Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report -The project site is located at 950 Mason Street (Assessorâs Block 0244, Lot 
001). The proposed project includes: 1) renovation of portions of the landmark 
1906 Fairmont Hotel building (City Landmark # 185), including consolidation of 
up to 60 hotel rooms; 2) reconfiguration of some existing hotel uses; 3) 
demolition of the 1961 23-story Fairmont Hotel tower above the five-story 
podium; and 4) construction of a new 160âunit, 26-story residential tower and 
five-story midrise residential component, both above a five-story podium, on the 
site of the existing hotel tower and podium (proposed to be demolished). The 
proposed project would include below-grade parking for about 350 vehicles.  The 
113,400-square-foot project site is located in an RM-4 (Residential Mixed-High 
Density) Use District and the Nob Hill Special Use District (SUD), and in 200-E, 
300-E and 320-E Height and Bulk Districts.  The proposed project would require 
Conditional Use (CU) authorization for height and bulk and for a Planned Unit 
Development (PUD) including exceptions to the 25 percent rear yard requirement, 
as well as require Planning Commission approval under the âLarge Tourist Hotel 
Conversion Ordinance,â Administrative Code 41F.3(f), among other approvals. The 
proposed exterior changes to the historic 1906 Fairmont Hotel building would 
also require a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Historic Preservation 
Commission. The Draft EIR found that implementation of the proposed project 
would result in a significant unavoidable environmental impact on cultural 
resources, related to demolition of the Tonga Room, which has been identified as 
a historic resource under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
NOTE: The 
action for this item falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Planning 
Commission.
Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the Final Environmental Impact 
Report.
Response to the Planning Commission Draft EIR questions.

6.Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Sugaya:
At last Thursdaysâ 
hearing, I made a comment regarding TipTop Market, that was -- let me put it in 
context. Commissioner Borden was in the process of saying what her feelings were 
about the project, and in summing up, she made a comment that there might be 
other opportunities to make money at the store, something else could be sold in 
the store, and she mentioned perhaps clothing, and I think kind of shrug it off 
as something that probably was not possible. In that context, I made a comment, 
which I learned on Monday from Supervisor Kim was taken as being very 
insensitive to the Tenderloin Community, and for that, I' m very, very sorry. It 
was not meant to be taken in that regard, and the comment was at that time 
directed to the project sponsor of TipTop Market, who is seeking a conditional 
use permit, so it was not intended to be addressed to the larger community, but 
it has been taken that way. Subsequently, I have talked to the owner of the 
market -- the tiptop market, to make sure that what I said was not offensive to 
him. He assured me that it was not, and he volunteered to come here today if 
needed, but I told him I did not think that was necessary and that I think 
people can take my word that he did not have a problem. I also then subsequently 
called and talked to Mr. Buckley at the central city  collaborative. He did say 
that members of the collaborative were interested in having a meeting with me, 
and we are currently in the process of setting that up, which I assume will be 
fairly shortly. To the greater community and especially the Tenderloin community 
and to Supervisor Kim, I do truly apologize for making that comment.
Commissioner Antonini:
Part of our general 
correspondence was a letter from the Jones Hall Law Firm, I believe directed to 
Michael Yarney, January 21, 2011, which is a restatement of infrastructure â 
proposed infrastructure refinancing, I believe it is available online, but I 
would like to see if we can get a hard copy of that. I think there was just the 
one copy. I do not remember receiving a is for today. I think that is an 
important issue and one I would like to look at a little bit more, It is a 
fairly long document to print out. Also want to thank SFPUC, I had a meeting 
with them I think the 12th of January, very productive meeting regards to the 
item we will be considering later on our agenda, and I met with Peter from SFMTA 
and we went over some very interesting plans for different parts of the City, 
and I thank him for taking the time, and I think we will be talking about those 
in greater detail in the weeks and months that follow.
Commissioner Moore:
I would like to spend a 
moment suggesting something to the Commissioners after receiving an e-mail 
regarding CEQA training. CEQA training is, for me, personally, an issue which is 
part of renewing my professional license. It takes time, but given or rendered 
by the proper people, that allows me to get the professional credits, given the 
organization that is doing it. While I am open for staff to give the training to 
the Commissioners, I would like to suggest that we perhaps stepped it up so that 
staff or a number of people who need the same training could get the credits 
from outside organizations like the Association of Environmental Professionals 
or the American Planning Association or the American Institute of Certified 
Planners to give this lesson to the Commissioners with staff being present, so 
that indeed, it is a win-win, for all of us who need to spend additional time. 
I' m not getting any discussion about CEQA. I believe it is in flux as being 
discussed that an outside organization might provide as training, which leaves 
those issues in flux, and we can acknowledge them. I think it would be better 
training, and it would help everybody in a broader way. That is just a 
suggestion on my part. I' m not representing any professional group which is 
doing this. I' m just suggesting taking a step further.
Commissioner Sugaya: 
  I believe it is in this current issue of the "Business Times" -- there is a 
small article mentioning that there was a city study done that said that 
ParkMerced was financially unfeasible. The problem with that paragraphâs little 
note, was that it was not referenced. It did not say whether it was an official 
City of San Francisco study or if it was done by someone independently or 
whatever. It had no references or anything, so I do not know what they were 
referring to. It made it sound like it was an independent study apart from the 
project sponsor. Maybe staff could look into that.
·Inquiries/Announcements.  
Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or 
inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.  
At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a 
Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda 
of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.

8.         Review 
of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and 
Historic Preservation Commission.
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
For the Board hearings this week, Finance Committee  met and discussed the 
Rincon Hill and the Mission Financing district. You did consider it the enabling 
legislation on July 22, 2010. You heard an ordinance that would create an area 
plan infrastructure finance committee to advise the City on infrastructure 
finance districts. You recommend approval knowing that it would be the first 
pilot program proposed. You ask that the Board seek additional funding to extend 
the pilot program to include it for the Eastern Neighborhood and ask that the 
City include additional study on the long- term effects for the general plan. 
The area plan infrastructure finance committee has been established. The 
Planning Department is one of the members of the Committee and is committed to 
ensuring that the concerns of the Commission are fairly considered. This week 
was an informational hearing at the Land Use Committee, and no action was taken. 
As far as the full Board, they did consider the appointment and reappointment of 
members of the Preservation Commission. On Tuesday, the Board approved 
appointments. All three members were approved. Also, there were a couple of 
introductions I would like to mention. Supervisor Winner requested a hearing on 
the impact of Historic Preservation policies on other major policy goals and the 
need to adopt legislation to ensure that policies are achieved. Supervisor 
Farrell introduce an amended ordinance to allow new restaurants not defined as 
formula retail and to require the Planning Commission to consider date time 
usage on the block when approving a new restaurant. Lastly, several supervisors 
introduced a resolution opposing current proposed changes to the California 
State budget to eliminate Redevelopment Agencies.
BOARD OF APPEALS:
As far as the Board of Appeals, Zoning Administrator Scott Sanchez informed me 
that although the  Board met, they did not consider any items pertinent to your 
Commission. Those are the only things I have to report for board of appeals.
HISTORIC PRESERVATION:
Last week, you did not get an update on the Historic Preservation Commission, 
but this week, you will for the hearing that was held last week.  Some items of 
interest to this Commission would be their request for review and comment to 
some resolution and findings recommended to approve nominations for the South 
San Francisco Opera House, and 3232 Pacific Avenue, the Jillian Labor House. 
Both of those motions were adopted. Finally, there was a request for 
appropriateness to replace ground floor store fronts installing windows and 
signs for the commercial tenant and civic center historic district.  Those will 
just the highlights of that hearing.
E.         
GENERALPUBLIC COMMENT â 15 MINUTES
At this time, 
members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the

Re: 
Calaveras Dam Replacement Project
G.CONSIDERATION OF FINDINGS AND FINAL ACTION â PUBLIC HEARING CLOSED
9.2005.0161E(C. KERN: (415) 575-9037)
CALAVERAS DAM REPLACEMENT PROJECT-Certification of the 
Final Environmental Impact Report -The San Francisco Public Utilities 
Commission (SFPUC) is proposing to implement the Calaveras Dam Replacement 
Project (CDRP) to meet WSIP levels of service for delivery reliability, seismic 
reliability and water quality. Since 2001, the SFPUC has operated Calaveras 
Reservoir at a reduced capacity of approximately 38,100 acre-feet under order of 
the California Department of Water Resources Division of Safety of Dams (DSOD) 
due to seismic safety concerns. The replacement dam would be the same height as 
the existing dam (completed in 1925) and would restore the capacity of Calaveras 
Reservoir to its pre-2001 DSOD restricted level of 96,850 acre-feet. The CDRP is 
located on Calaveras Creek in the Diablo Mountain Range in Alameda County, 
approximately 12 miles south of the City of Pleasanton and 7.5 miles east of the 
City of Fremont. Calaveras Reservoir straddles the border between Alameda and 
Santa Clara Counties.
Preliminary 
Recommendation: Certify the Environmental Impact Report
NOTE: The public hearing 
on the Draft EIR is closed. The public comment period for the Draft EIR ended on 
December 21, 2009. The Planning Commission does not conduct public review of
