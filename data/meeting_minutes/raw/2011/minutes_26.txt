Commissioner Moore:
As 
follow up to Mr. Levittâs acknowledgement of the Commissionâs vote on Dolores 
Street, Iâd like to add a comment to also thank the Department, which indeed 
prepared the recommendation to acknowledge and uphold the Market Octavia Plan.  
So in addition to the Director, it is the entire Department who prepared the 
recommendation.
Commissioner Antonini:
I 
want to thank the San Giacomo family.  I took a tour of the building that is now 
complete â I think its 1088 Mission, which is the first part of the Trinity 
Plaza.  I was very impressed by what has been done there and how well it was 
done.  One interesting thing that they do is that they are using steam heat, 
which I think is a very efficient method that is utilized quite a bit in 
Manhattan where the steam is produced off-site and it brought into the 
building.  I presume it will be brought into the other buildings there too.  
They then return water back as it condenses and they get a credit for it towards 
the cost of the steam heat.  It is something we have to look at because it has 
been very effective in Manhattan where you can have a central site and you use 
that heating, particularly in our mild climate I think steam heat is ideal 
because it is an efficient way to do things and there might be a future for 
that.  I was impressed with the building and they have started on the second 
phase â demolition has begun.
I 
also had a meeting on Tuesday night with neighbors and project sponsors for a 
project I believe is before us next week on Valencia Street.  It was good to see 
everyone getting together and answering a lot of the questions ahead of time 
that were raised.  Maybe we can do more of that in the future.  We had a good 
meeting with the parties involved.  I think it was successful.
I 
would also like to ask for sometime in the future for a hearing on parking in 
San Francisco.  I know this a rather large issue, but I think that we need to 
calendar something well advance in the future so the public can be aware of it 
and people can come and testify about their issues city wide.  What happens is 
we hear these issues with discrete projects or discrete neighborhoods and we 
hear just the area surrounding the particular project or the neighborhood and 
you end up getting people on either side of the issue that are just indicative 
of that particular area.  The impacts of parting are city wide and area wide.  I 
think that we really need to hear from people who normally may not be involved, 
but are the same ones that may have a lot of issues surrounding parking and 
would I think welcome the chance to express their views in general about 
problems they may have.  Particularly when I go to other cities that donât have 
a transit-first policy like we do and itâs a lot easier to walk around and 
everybody seems to be able to park.  When you go around places like Sacramento 
or San Jose, or even San Diego for example, I just donât see the problem.  So 
something is going wrong, especially with the comments about pedestrian injuries 
and everything.  Maybe our policy needs to be reconsidered or somehow structured 
so that we can work out something that can get results.  I would ask that the 
Commission consider scheduling a time to hear comments from the public and 
comments from commissioners about parking in general and perhaps revisiting our 
city policies and decide whether transit-first in residential parking are not 
necessarily mutually exclusive.  I think they can be worked out in a better way.
Commissioner Miguel:
During the week I met with people regarding 800 Presidio, and also yesterday, 
Commissioner Moore and I had an opportunity to watch the Departmentâs 
Residential Design Team in action.  We saw them review three projects.  This 
somewhat newly instituted situation was more obvious to us as how it works.  
From my point of view, it works very well.  The group gets along well; has no 
compulsion against speaking out to each other as to how they feel on a project, 
but are very professional in the manner to which they do it.
Commissioner Olague:
I 
would support calendaring something eventually.Probably the full 
Commission would be best. We will only have one week where we are all here. Then 
we have the tourism request of Commissioner Fong.  It would be interesting to 
have a balanced discussion on that issue.
Commissioner Moore:
I missed the first part of what you're suggesting. You're talking about where 
the appropriate places for parking would be. This would have to be a discussion 
that is more balanced.
Commissioner Sugaya:
If could we extend that discussion to include an update on where we are with our 
overall transportation infrastructure and the funding expected to improve these; 
and these are built not just on the existing infrastructure but also the Better 
Street Plan which reflects an attitude which is more biased towards pedestrians 
and is pedestrian friendly; and is a public forum environment. That would seem 
to be a balanced discussion.  And I would like to see which projects did or did 
not get the parking approvals; and where the additional garages are planned. We 
have a balance including where we are managing the excess and availability in 
downtown through electronic means, which creates a more efficient operation for 
those people  who come in and don' t know where to park. There is a whole 
assessment of supply and demand in order to have the discussion that 
Commissioner Antonini is looking for. Once we get past that, it will be nice to 
have some conversations about policy.  We have a great group of experts.
President Olague:
We will propose some dates and make sure that you are all here. If the issue is 
going to be somewhat surrounding parking, I think there will be other innovative 
things going on that can be talked about. We can utilize the new smart meters. 
We can actually see what parking spaces are vacant. I don't think they have gone 
mobile with that yet, or if they are even contemplating.  There are other things 
that might be going on to address that in urban areas.
Commissioner Antonini:
I think the broader the discussion, the better. In keeping with what 
Commissioner Sugaya suggested, keeping up with what has been cut in other 
cities, dense cities, where there is still a lot of traffic, can be somewhat 
analogous to our situation.
3.         
Directorâs Announcements
Director Rahaim:
On the last topic, we will be happy to coordinate with MTA. It is managing the 
on-street spaces that will allow them to do variable pricing. The goal is to 
keep parking space. That will come into play very soon. We received an 
announcement regarding the Open Space Element. We have had to postpone that 
meeting. Just in terms of the project status, we have not set the new date for 
it yet. But we will let you know about that. There is an upcoming meeting that I 
wanted to tell you about. The Broadway Design Plan, this is for a streetscape 
designed for the Broadway Tunnel. We are working with the Community Development 
Center on this. The first workshop will be Wednesday, May 4 from 4:30 to 6:30. I 
just realized I donât have the location in my notes. We will get you that 
information. It is the first of several workshops.
I attended the APA Conference the last few days. It took place in Boston this 
year. There were about 5000 participants, there were some sessions regarding 
regional planning.The staff also attended some interesting sessions about social media that has 
become a very interesting issue among planning agencies. We heard a word of 
caution and words of support for that. There is increasing interest from the 
public for us to do that. We have to be careful about the legal implications as 
well. It was interesting to note, talking to my counterpart about the issues 
facing Boston.  Knowing that Boston was in many ways similar to San Francisco, 
it is almost the exact same size geographically. I had somehow thought it was 
larger. But the City's share a lot in terms of physical characteristics, the 
graphics, and the population is approximately 650,000. We are denser. They 
pointed out that they grew at a faster pace than San Francisco in the last 
census. Next year, the conference is in Los Angeles. Given the fact that it is 
relatively close, I have asked staff to consider proposing sessions on some of 
the recent planning efforts we have done over the past few years. We look 
forward to doing that.
4.         Review 
of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and 
Historic Preservation Commission.
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
§110147 Mission Streetscape Plan.This item is a 
General Plan Amendment of the Mission Area Plan to reflect the Commissionâs 
adoption of the Mission Streetscape Plan.  On January 20, 2011 the Commission 
adopted the Plan and adopted a resolution to amend the General Plan with this 
Ordinance.  While no Board action was required for the adoption of the 
streetscape plan itself, the Board does need to adopt the Ordinance to amend the 
General Plan.This week the Full Board passed the ordinance on the first 
reading.
§Urban Agriculture.This week the 
Full Board adopted the ordinance that would ease regulations on gardening and 
farming in San Francisco.  At the February 17th hearing, the Commission voted to 
recommend Approval with 7 Potential Modifications of the proposed Ordinance. 
Most of these modifications were incorporated.  In addition, the legislative 
sponsors added some further modifications such as:
1)Further clarify that sales of produce grown on site may occur.This 
was incorporated into the ordinance.
2)Modify the compost setback to at least three feet from structures.Again, accommodated.
3)Renumber the Section for Urban Agriculture from 102.34 to 102.35.Done.
4)Clarify that the fencing requirement is optional and that should fencing 
be used that it need not be completely opaque.In this case, Legislative 
Sponsor, Supervisor David Chiu, chose to expand the fencing options for 
agricultural uses to include chain link fencing WHEN the fencing is covered with 
plantings.
5)Continue working to keep permit and change of use fees for urban 
agriculture minimal and to compare permit fee differences between short-term and 
long-term uses of land for Urban Agriculture.Staff looked into this issue 
and shared the costs of temporary use fees with the Urban Ag. Working Group.  
This group consisted of the Legislative Sponsors: Mayor Lee, Supervisor David 
Chiu, various city departments and various representatives of urban agriculture, 
and business operators.  In the end, the group did not feel the fees for 
temporary or seasonal use provided enough relief to warrant use and instead 
preferred the regular entitlement process.
6)Consider looking into adding language into the proposed Ordinance to 
allow value added sales.In this case, the Mayor amended the Ordinance to 
allow Limited Sales of value-added goods in all districts except âRâ districts, 
and only then in the case where the primary ingredients are grown on site.
7)Explore the use of soil testing to clarify concerns related to soil 
toxicity.In this case, there are preemptive state and federal laws that 
govern the growing conditions for food to be sold to the public.
Mayor Lee also 
amended the legislation to incorporate the PUCâs amendments for Water 
Conservation.  Lastly, Supervisor Chiu changed the name of "Industrial 
Agriculture" use to "Large Scale Urban Agriculture."With these amendments, 
Supervisor Cohen signed on as the third sponsor.  This week the Full Board 
passed the Ordinance on FINAL reading.
2 CEQA 
Appeals at the BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
·CEQA EIR Certification Appeal 
of 350 Mission StreetâThis case 
involved construction of a 375-foot tall office building with ground floor 
retail uses. The appellantâs concerns were centered on the granting of 
exceptions. These exceptions were alleged to result in impacts not analyzed in 
the EIR.  The appellant failed to provide evidence demonstrating that the 
project would result in a significant impact. The project was analyzed as 
proposed, and the exceptions were not found to be significant. Supervisor Kim 
acknowledged, in the only comment, that the issues raised by the appellant 
belong before the Board of Appeals and not in an EIR appeal. The Board of 
Appeals is scheduled to hear the project in a couple of weeks.In the end, 
this appeal was rejected and the EIR Certification was unanimously upheld 10-0.
·Appeal of the Cat Ex for 1653 
Grant Ave.This was a case that you 
heard as a Discretionary Review on February 24.  The appeal of the Cat Ex was 
filed by the Telegraph Hill Dwellers.  This hearing lasted over 2 hours and had 
a good deal of testimony on both sides.  The appellants argued that there could 
be potential cumulative health impacts from this antenna, plus pending 
antennas.  Supervisor Chiu made the motion to uphold the Cat Ex, citing the 
Federal Telecommunications Act as a limiting factor in the Cityâs ability to 
regulate potential health impacts. While he made the motion to uphold the CEQA 
work, he also asked the Department a couple of questions.  First, he expressed 
interest in a City-led "Master Plan" to guide the location of future antennas.  
He requested that we outline a process and estimated cost for producing such a 
document.  Second, he believes we should make some changes to our current review 
process.  Specifically, he believes that all antenna installations in disfavored 
sites should demonstrate the necessity for this location: i.e., make the same 
findings we currently require for macro-cell antennas which need a CU before the 
Commission.  With those statements, he was able to garner a 9-2 (Mirkarimi & 
Mar) vote in support of the cat Ex.

950 Mason Street - Fairmont Hotel Project-Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report -The project 
site is located at 950 Mason Street (Assessorâs Block 0244, Lot 001). The 
proposed project includes: 1) renovation of portions of the landmark 1906 
Fairmont Hotel building (City Landmark # 185), including consolidation of up to 
60 hotel rooms; 2) reconfiguration of some existing hotel uses; 3) demolition of 
the 1961 23-story Fairmont Hotel tower above the five-story podium; and 4) 
construction of a new 160âunit, 26-story residential tower and five-story 
midrise residential component, both above a five-story podium, on the site of 
the existing hotel tower and podium (proposed to be demolished). The proposed 
project would include below-grade parking for about 350 vehicles.  The 
113,400-square-foot project site is located in an RM-4 (Residential Mixed-High 
Density) Use District and the Nob Hill Special Use District (SUD), and in 200-E, 
300-E and 320-E Height and Bulk Districts.  The proposed project would require 
Conditional Use (CU) authorization for height and bulk and for a Planned Unit 
Development (PUD) including exceptions to the 25 percent rear yard requirement, 
as well as require Planning Commission approval under the âLarge Tourist Hotel 
Conversion Ordinance,â Administrative Code 41F.3(f), among other approvals. The 
proposed exterior changes to the historic 1906 Fairmont Hotel building would 
also require a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Historic Preservation 
Commission. The Draft EIR found that implementation of the proposed project 
would result in a significant unavoidable environmental impact on cultural 
resources, related to demolition of the Tonga Room, which has been identified as 
a historic resource under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the Final Environmental Impact 
Report.
