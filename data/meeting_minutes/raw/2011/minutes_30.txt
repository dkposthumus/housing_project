B.COMMISSIONERSâ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
5.         
Commission Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements.  
Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or 
inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.  
At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a 
Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda 
of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Miguel:During the past week I have worked with some people regarding the high-speed 
rail that impacts Mission Bay; Iâve met with several other people regarding cell 
phone antennas in the city.
Commissioner Sugaya:This morning I was reading about the Americaâs cup.  Maybe there are some 
materials about that or maybe under the Directorâs Report â¦ Secondly, apparently 
they are going to make the mid-Market eastbound traffic permanent after the 
experiment and this is not going to require any type of environmental review.  
If we could look at that
Commissioner Moore:More grass-roots rumors in support of the Americaâs Cup.  I understand that many 
of the local organizations and other venues in the Golden Gate Club which 
sponsored the Americaâs Cup are stepping in so it becomes even a larger event 
than what is only described by the simply the Americaâs Cup.  Iâm really glad to 
hear that because itâs that mutual engagement where we all have a much richer 
and robust discussion of how to approve it.
Commissioner Antonini:  
In this last week I was able to meet with on the architects on the Public Safety 
building which is coming up in the future.  Although it wonât be an item before 
us, it is a project for redevelopment.  I think we will be able to see the 
design and some of us will have meetings and be able to weigh in.  I think it 
will be a very promising project and one that will be important.  I also had a 
meeting with the Dean of a major institution here in San Francisco who is in the 
process of looking to relocate to a new facility.  We are hoping to keep them 
within San Francisco.  It is promising.  We have reason to believe we will be 
able to find a site that will work for them.  I am optimistic about that.  
Finally, in terms of other issues, the facebook decision, as most have read 
about, to relocate to the Sun Micro campus is unfortunate in one regard because 
it was reported that 50% of their employees take public transit, bike or walk to 
the campus.  It will be impossible at the Sun Micro campus from what I heard.  I 
bet a high percentage of their employees live in San Francisco.  You never 
know.  Things may happen in the future, but I think it would be great if 
companies like that took a look to the north where most of their employees are 
or want to be.
Commissioner Olague:In the last week we mentioned Americaâs Cup and a few commissioners had a list 
of things they would like to schedule.  We will work with staff to try to come 
up with a reasonable calendar to hear more policy issues.  Maybe starting in the 
summer we can start calendaring that stuff.
6.         
Directorâs Announcements
Director Rahaim:In the interest of time I want to make an announcement â just to repeat that 
next Wednesday evening, the 16th, at 6 p.m. I will be hosting a 
public discussion about the Housing Element.  That is Wednesday, the 16that the Department.  The latest draft of the Housing Element is out and it is 
available online.  I think you have copies.  The purpose of next weekâs meeting 
is to facilitate a discussion about the most recent changes.  There will be an 
informational hearing on February 24, with action tentatively scheduled for 
March 24.  I think that is it for me.
7.         Review 
of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and 
Historic Preservation Commission.
Board of Supervisors:
Upper Market NCDâ The Commission initiated a Planning Code text amendment on 
November 4, 2010 recommending approval.  The ordinance intends to achieve the 
following:  ensure commercial & residential development is consistent with 
existing development patterns; provide relief from parking requirements & 
encourage more transit-oriented development; and ensure new development provides 
community benefits to offset new impacts to infrastructure due to new 
development.  Because this draft ordinance did not benefit from a substantial 
process to inform people of pending fee changes, the Commission recommended 
applying all the controls upon adoption of the Ordinance while providing an 
exemption from certain impact fees for pre-existing projects that are able to 
make good on their permit application by securing planning entitlements within 2 
years. After last weekâs Land Use hearing we discovered that the project at 299 
Market Street has not yet been secured.  The project would be subject to this 
Ordinance upon adoption â thereby disturbing the community/developer agreement.  
This week supervisor mar introduced changes to the Ordinance that would exempt 
this project from the legislation so that the community/developer agreement is 
not disturbed.  Like the current fee exemption within the Ordinance, this 
exemption was drafted such that the developer has a set window for completing 
the entitlements.  If all entitlements are not secured within two years the 
Ordinance would apply in full to this property as well.  With that amendment, 
the Ordinance passed first reading with the Full Board.
New Citypolicies governing the 
future use of IFDs and the creation of a Rincon Hill Pilot IFDâ On 
July 22, 2010 you heard an Ordinance that created an âArea Plan Infrastructure 
Finance Committee.â  The committee includes four public stakeholders and 
representatives from Planning, OEWD, Mayorâs Office of Public Policy & Finance, 
Controller, the Capital Planning Committee and other implementing agencies.  
This committee is to advise the Board on appropriate public policies for IFDs 
and the Pilot IFD on Rincon Hill.  You recommended approval of the process with 
the understanding that Rincon Hill would be the first IFD pilot project.  You 
recommended 2 considerations;  that the Board seek additional funding to extend 
a second IFD pilot program for the Eastern Neighborhoods; and second, that the 
city conduct additional study of the long-term effects on the General fund.  
Since your action the APIF Committee supervised the establishment of the 
Committee; drafting of policies governing the use of IFDs were approved to 
protect the General Fund; and completion of a Fiscal Impact analysis studying 
the long-term effects of the Rincon hill Pilot IFD on the General Fund.  The 
analysis showed that there would be a net fiscal surplus at build-out.  The 
Planning Department has been actively involved in the process.  Staff has served 
on the APIF Committee to ensure that the Commissionâs concerns were fairly 
addressed.  This week the Full Board unanimously approved all of the 8 pieces of 
legislation on first reading.  The property owners also voted on the IFD on 
Tuesday and their vote was counted at the Board.  There was 100% approval by all 
property owners.  All that awaits is the second reading of the draft ordinance 
and the Mayorâs signature of the IFD ordinance.  With these last steps, the city 
will have created the first IFD in the state.
This week Supervisor Mirkarimi introduced amendments to the Planning Codeâ the amendments deal largely with restaurant controls and increase the maximum 
size for small self-service restaurants and the minimum size for large 
self-service restaurants and it would require that certain other provisions 
including removing a prohibition on on-site food preparation in retail coffee 
stores.  That will be before you with 90 days for your consideration.
Board of Appeals:
2139 Taraval Street, 
a Medical Cannabis Dispensary approved by this Commission.  The Board of Appeals 
overturned that approval and denied the permit.  Last night they had adoption of 
findings for that denial.  The Board adopted those findings and now the permit 
holder will have a 10-day window to file a rehearing request.
The other two items were related to General Advertising Signs.  
They were both permits that sought removal of general advertising signs.  The 
appeals were filed to allow replacement of those signs.  Under the Planning code 
you cannot replace a general advertising sign.  On one of the cases, it is 
interesting to note that it was a sign company that filed the appeal.  They had 
filed the permit to remove the sign; they called the Department of Building 
Inspection; had a final inspection done; and then sought to appeal the permit 
because they realized they had made a mistake and they didnât really want to 
remove the sign.  The Board voted to uphold the permit for both those cases that 
the signs cannot be replaced.  Both cases were represented by Dan Sider of 
staff, who is now undefeated before the Board of Appeals.
