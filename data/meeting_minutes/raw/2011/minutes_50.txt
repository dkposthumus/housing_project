Disability Access Improvements for Small Businesses and Landlord Obligations-The Commission will consider an Ordinance introduced by Supervisor David Chiu concerning ADA accessas it relates to the use size of self-service restaurants and retail coffee stores.  Specifically, the proposed Ordinance would  amend the San Francisco Planning Code by amending Sections 790.90, 790.91, and 790.102 to allow small self-service restaurants and retail coffee stores to exclude the square footage of floor area required for disabled access from the calculation of maximum allowable square footage for such uses under applicable zoning restrictions. The proposed ordinance also amends the San Francisco Administrative Code by adding Chapter 38, Sections 38.1 through 38.6; amends the San Francisco Campaign and Governmental Conduct Code Section 3.400; requiring commercial landlords leasing to small businesses for public accommodations to: 1) bring ground floor entrances to, and exits from, the building into compliance with applicable state and federal disability access laws; 2) inform small business tenants of the potential legal and financial liabilities for failure to comply with those laws; 3) include in any new or amended leases a provision addressing the respective obligations of the landlord and small business tenant to bring the leased premises into compliance with those access laws; 4) require the City to give priority to building permit applications for work to bring space leased to small business tenants into compliance with those access laws; and 6) adopt environmental findings, Planning Code Section 302 findings, and findings of consistency with the General Plan and Planning Code Section 101.1.
