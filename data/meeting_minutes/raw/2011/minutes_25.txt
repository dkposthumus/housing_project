Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or 
inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.  
At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a

of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Antonini:I did have a meeting this week with the project sponsors of 2535 Dolores.  In 
view of the events in Japan, we have to be very cognizant of the fact that much 
of out housing stock is seismically compromised and we have to make sure that we 
modify or change some of our land use policies to be able to make it possible 
for owners of these properties to be able to renovate them, particularly now 
with our very wise look at the historical nature of this housing stock that we 
are not going to take the tack that we did in the â60s, which was a wrong one, 
to just demolish everything, rather to be able to renovate them and to 
seismically upgrade them.  I think that is a really important thing to think 
about as we move forward.
Commissioner Miguel:   
I also met regarding Dolores Street, and I have been having continuing meetings 
and discussions regard the Veteranâs Administration Medical Center out on 
Clement Street at 42nd, which although is not in the direct perview 
of this Commission or the city, effects the neighborhood that surrounds it.  
They actually donât know what theyâre doing.  They say they want to go to Pier 
70, but they say the want to double the campus out there at the same time.  Itâs 
obviously one or the other.
Commissioner Moore:  
I would be interested, as soon as itâs available, from hearing from the center 
in Berkeley on the effects of this magnitude earthquake relative to our own 
codes.  And in addition to that, I am interested in how the devastating 
experience for this particular tsunami plays itself out for us.  We are not 
immune and some of the information that is being spread around â that because we 
have a shallow bay it would be less â that is technically incorrect.  I would 
like to hear some expert opinion on that.
Commissioner Olague:  
That would be great.
Commissioner Sugaya:  
Just to follow up on that, I think that would be important especially I think 
with respect to the issue of the seismic performance of the buildings vs. the 
buildings that were destroyed by the waves and see how the codes performed.
Commissioner Olague:  
It would be great to have some sort of presentation, maybe in June.  We are 
still going to schedule this MTA discussion, right?
5.         
Directorâs Announcements
Director Rahaim:I just 
want to let the Commission know that we have posted the position for the 
Communications Manager for the Department that is part of the budget which we 
have recently received approval to hire that position.  It is open until March 
29th.  Secondly, you will be receiving a memo in the next week on the 
census data, which came out recently.  As you may have heard the cityâs 
population, according to the census, is at 805,325 â about a 28,000 person 
increase from 2000, about a 3.7% increase.  The city continues to be fairly 
diverse â 49% Caucasian, 33% Asian, down to 6% Black â the Black population has 
been dropping and is the largest decrease in the city.  The Latino population 
has grown and is now 15% of the population in the city.  The most growth is in 
District 6, the South of Market area.  As it is currently configured, it is the 
largest District in the city.
6.         Review 
of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and 
Historic Preservation Commission.
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
Land Use Committee:
·Represented by Rich Hillis, Treasure Island/Yerba Buena Island Redevelopment 
project was before the Land Use Committee
Full Board of Supervisors:
·Area Plan Waiver Criteria for Affordable Housing âThis ordinance would amend 
the existing waiver of certain Area Plan fees.  The proposed changes contained 
in this ordinance were considered by this commission on 12/9/10 as a proposal to 
amend the Visitacion Valley Amendment.  At that time, the Planning Department 
recommended that the legislation be approved as proposed but the Commission did 
not pass a recommendation.  Instead, the Commission made a respectful 
recommendation that Supervisor Maxwell continue working with all parties on the 
issue of fees.  This week the Board passed the ordinance on final reading.
·Development Impact and In-Lieu Fees âThis proposed ordinance, sponsored by the Mayor would amend Article 4 to clarify 
language, eliminate confusion as to when the requirements must be met, increase 
consistency between the way impact fees are administered and correct errors in 
cross-referencing.  This commission heard this item on 12/16/10.  At that time 
you recommended approval.  Since you heard the ordinance, the Mayor has amended 
it to include suggestions from both the Mayorâs Office of Housing and the 
Controllerâs Office.  Among these changes was the addition of an uncodified 
section that will allow this yearâs adjustment of all fees for inflation within 
30 days of the effective date of the ordinance.  The Board made this last change 
as an amendment on Tuesday and then approved the ordinance on first reading.
·Upper Fillmore NCD Changes âThis proposed ordinance, sponsored by Supervisor Farrell, would remove the 
current prohibition against new restaurants in this NCD.  Under this proposal, 
restaurants would be allowed by CU.  This commission considered the ordinance on 
1/13/11 recommending approval but also with the recommendation to allow large 
fast-food restaurants by CU.  You also respectfully requested that the 
Supervisor continue additional public outreach.  The Supervisor has worked with 
the Department and appropriate merchant and neighborhood groups and has amended 
the legislation to allow large fast-food restaurants by CU; to specify that when 
the Commission considers restaurants in this area, the Commission shall consider 
whether the use would propose lunch service or other daytime usages in order to 
limit the number of such businesses that have no daytime activity; and lastly it 
would allow a new bar via CU when that bar is provided in conjunction with a 
full-service restaurant.  With these amendments, the Board approved the 
ordinance on first reading.
·Appeal of Calaveras Dam EIR âThis appeal and a proposed settlement were heard on Tuesday.  The appellant 
(East Bay Regional Parks District) had reached a tentative settlement agreement 
with the PUC prior to the appeal hearing.  However, as you know, no approval 
action can occur until there is a valid CEQA document in place.  And, in the 
event the Board did not approve the settlement, the appellant needed to go 
through with the CEQA appeal to preserve their right to future legal action by 
exhausting their administrative appeal rights.  At the CEQA hearing, the 
appellant stated that they are satisfied with the settlement, if adopted by the 
Board.  The Department has submitted a detailed brief in support of the EIR but 
only made a brief presentation at the hearing considering the appellantâs 
statement.  The Board upheld the Planning Commissionâs decision to certify the 
EIR, and then approved the settlement agreement between PUC and EBRPD.
Introductions:
·Various Park Merced ordinances were introducedincluding an ordinance amending the General Plan, an ordinance amending the 
Zoning Map; an ordinance amending the Planning Code; and an ordinance amending 
the Development Agreement.
·Supervisor Chiu introduced various pieces of legislation related to the North 
Beach Branch Library,including the Zoning Map amendment which will be heard by this Commission on 
April 21.
·Supervisor Mirkarimi revised an ordinanceresponding to the Planning Commissionâs recommendations on his legislation to 
create active street frontages on Fillmore Street between Bush and McAllister.
Hearing Request:
·Supervisors Avalos and Chiuhave requested a hearing for an update from the Department of Public Works on 
the implementation and effectiveness of the 2009 Blight Ordinance amending 
Administrative Code, Chapter 80, Section 80.4
BOARD OF APPEALS:
·LawrenceKornfield is taking another 
assignment and will no longer represent the Department of Building Inspection at 
the Board of Appeals.This is a tremendous loss.  I have learned so much from him through his 
experience and insights.  I would like to take this opportunity to express deep 
appreciation for all he has given to the city and to me personally.  I wish him 
all the best in the future.

Re:       
It was very refreshing that this hearing started on time â even through no one 
showed up for it.  However, I want to thank you for getting your ducks in a row 
on that, and especially Ms. Avery.  I was watching your hearing all day today 
and she very specifically was on you about making sure that you are scheduling.  
So Ms. Avery, I want to thank you for being a good heard-rider on these folks.
