Commissioner Antonini:
First of all, happy to report that the Subcommittee for the Commissions Secretary search has been meeting in smaller groups, and I think we are moving closer to a situation where we may be seeing a job application issued, thanks to the cooperation of the Department of Human Resources and others. We will continue meeting, and the Subcommittee will be meeting in another week to continue the process. You get out what you put into it and we feel that we've put in the necessary hours to make sure the product that comes out will help us to try to find as close a replacement as we can for Linda, which is a very difficult thing to do, but we want it to be as good as it possibly can be.
On another subject, I think we were all really thrilled by the Giants' win and the parade yesterday, and I had the good fortune to see the entire thing. I thought some of the remarks by some of the speakers, players and others, rose above what you usually get. I was particularly impressed by the remarks of Manager Bruce Bochy. He talked about the life lessons that can be learned from a victory. Perseverance, cooperation, humility are all important lessons. Team members doing things that they don't usually do to help the team win. Starters pitching in middle relief, pitchers being called upon to deliver big hits and sluggers having to bunt and all those sort of things are good lessons for us because sometimes we have to do things in our lives that we're not accustomed to doing and may not be our job, but we have to do the best we can. I was very happy to hear an analogy drawn by Sergio Romo talking about the Giants being a lot like the City of San Francisco. I'm paraphrasing his remarks, but he basically talked about the diverse group that comes from all over the world speaking different languages, but collectively they can do great things. He sort of made an analogy to our City. So, I thought that was really good, and finally, Buster Posy talking about the fact that a win like this is more than just a win, but it has the ability to lift municipal spirits. This theory has been brought forward in the past, but I think there is some validity to that. Certainly the only admonishment is that even though it's fine to live vicariously through the team, it never gives anyone the license to destroy property or assault someone just because there's been a victory. We don't want to be classified with some of the things that have been said about some cities in the past where they have riots whether they win or lose. Glad yesterday seemed to go very well from what I've heard as far as that was concerned. So, it's great to win, but it's even greater to see good things come out of it for the entire City.
Commissioner Moore:
As a follow-up to what Commissioner Antonini was saying, the City looked extremely photogenic in general when you see the area photo of the Civic Center area. When you looked, literally everyone was wearing black and orange, overall it was spectacular. So, I think everybody who participated made it happening. We all can pat each other on the shoulder that this came about in a wonderful way.
5.         Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
I ask just wanted to thank those of you who attended the Board hearing on Tuesday in honor of Linda Avery-Herbert. It was a resolution that was proposed by Supervisor Olague to honor Linda for her 32 years of service and named Tuesday as Linda Avery-Herbert Day in the City. Several staff attended as well and I think it was an appropriate honor for Linda for all of her service to the City. So, thank you all for attending
