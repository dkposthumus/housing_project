1.(A. RODGERS (415) 558-6395)
ADOPTION OF PROCEDURES MANUAL UPDATE-Update to the Inclusionary Housing Procedures Manual- The Inclusionary Affordable Housing Program requires residential developments to pay an Affordable Housing Fee.  Project sponsors may apply for an alternative to the fee in the form of providing fifteen percent (15%) of their units on-site or 20% of their units off-site as affordable to low- to moderate-income households. These percentages are higher in certain parts of the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan Area. This program is governed by San Francisco Planning Code Section 415 et seq., and is administered by the San Francisco Mayor's Office of Housing. Planning Code Section 415 requires that the Mayor’s Office of Housing and the Planning Department publish a Procedures Manual containing procedures for monitoring and enforcement of the policies and procedures for implementation of the Program.  This Monitoring and Procedures Manual contains information regarding the Program for potential Buyers and renters of below market rate Units, as well as for information for Projects sponsors, owners and property managers of Units developed under the Program.  Updates to the Manual occur as needed. The last update to the Manual was adopted by the Planning Commission on June 28, 2007. This update is required due to recent changes in Planning Code Section 415.  Preliminary Recommendation: Adoption.

C.COMMISSIONERS’ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
10.        Commission Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements.  Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Antonini:
A couple of things:  first of the all, and not to throw water on the Giants and I was there for game seven and it was a terrific night, but I took Muni back that night and after riding public transportation in many cities, we need to have clean secure trips for passengers. Some of the tunnels are long and people were in there with their belongings and blocking the area and aggressive panhandling and when you go to the Stockton Street and are by yourself in the narrow tunnel and it is hard to get through, and people are occupying areas, and I hope that we can look into this. Muni I understand got additional funding and one of the first things they should use it for in conjunction with BART is better security in their stations if they want riders to feel safe when they ride it in the evening or any other time but other than that everything has been great.I do want to mention a couple of other things. First of all the Subcommittee for the Secretary Search, the two Chairs or Presidents of that Subcommittee, myself and Diane Masuda from the Historic Preservation Commission had a meeting with representatives from DHR yesterday to try to work on an issue that we have been grappling with – the classification of the job being offered regrettably to replace Linda Avery as our Commission Secretary - and I am happy to report we are continuing to meet on that subject and hopefully we can work that out to everyone's satisfaction. We have another meeting scheduled for Tuesday, and I also want to say and you all probably know this already, it is Linda's last day, and we're going to be very sad, and it won't seem the same without her, but it's what she has and needs to do and we certainly appreciate all the years of service and particularly me because I served with her over ten years now and it's been wonderful.
President Fong and Commissioners:
The Commission, through President Fong, presented Secretary Avery with a framed picture of a portion of the rotunda of City Hall, a card, and acknowledgements of her years of service to the City and the Commissions.  Each commissioner individually expressed their appreciation and congratulations.
Commissioner Sugaya:
At a later time during the meeting, on behalf of the Historic Preservation Commission, Commissioner Sugaya presented Secretary Avery with a very unique and beautiful floral arrangement – expressing that Commission’s appreciation of her service to them, and forwarded that Commission’s expressions of congratulations.
11.        Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
I must add my thanks on behalf of the staff for Linda for the 31 years of service to the City and the support for the Commission and the Department as a whole. It has been a great honor to work with Linda over the last five years and I know staff feels the same. For years and Linda has been a guide for me coming to San Francisco and not understanding this place well and a great support for me and has supported me on my personal behalf as well as well as the Department. Thank you Linda.
12.        Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
LAND USE COMMITTEE:
On Monday, the Land Use Committee heard the POPOS Signage Ordinance,sponsored by Supervisor Chiu. This item was heard and approved with modifications by this Commission on June 7th.  Supervisor Chiu adopted all Planning Commission’s modifications. After the Planning Commission hearing, The Mayor’s Office on Disability asked that these signs specifically complied with ADA standards. Supervisor’s Office and Planning Staff worked closely with MOD staff to make sure that the ZA bulletin’s dimension and graphic requirements reflect the ADA standards. The Code was amended so that existing signage that is not compliant with Federal and State requirements would also be subject to the new requirements. This is an addition to the Planning Commission’s recommendation under which existing signage would be subject to the new requirements when they are not compliant with the requirements of the Planning Code at the time of project approval.The Committee recommended support of this Ordinance to the Full Board.  The Land Use Committee also heard the Housing Trust Fund Monitoring Ordinance, sponsored by Supervisor Chiu.This Commission approved this item with modifications last week. This week Supervisor Chiu adopted all of the Commission modifications. Mayor’s Office of Housing proposed another modification asking that the monitoring reports also evaluate programs that provide assistance to household earning 120% or more of AMI. This is because the Housing Trust Fund provides one program that provides assistance to this income category.The Committee recommended support of the Ordinance with Planning Commission and Mayor’s office of Housing’s modifications to the Full Board.The Land Use Committee heard another piece of Supervisor Chiu’s NE Legislation.  This time the Committee voted to approve the portion of the Ordinance that would expand the allowable floor area for Limited Corner Commercial Uses, or LCCUs, from 1200 sq. ft. to 2500 sq. ft.  and to allow them within 100’ of a corner instead of 50’ from a corner within RTO-M Districts.  The Board already voted to expand this provision in the RM-3 and RM-4 Districts, and that change has been made in the Planning Code, however there was a desire by one of the cosponsor of the legislation, Supervisor Campos,  to expand the provision to include RTO-M Districts.  This Commission voted not to change the LCCU controls because they were adopted as part of the Market and Octavia Plan, and are set to be reviewed under the 5 year review process for that plan.The committee recommended that the Mission District RTO be updated to allow these Corner Commercial uses.
