13.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
I want to mention I have had several questions about the proposed new billboard on the 1660 [1650]Mission Streetbuilding that happens to be owned by the City.This is a building that the Department is in.There is a proposal to replace the existing advertising side on the eastern side of the building.Just to be clear, that is a legal sign. And it is legally permitted to exist again.The City is negotiating a new contract with the sign provider.It would be substantially smaller because it would have to comply with new State regulations regarding distance from State Highways.Otis Streetis actually part of Highway 101 and a sign has never existed there.In the proposal that is currently under consideration, it can exist there but under a much smaller size.There was a public meeting about that Tuesday night.The final disposition would have to go to the Board, and the Board will be considering the new contract with the sign company in the coming weeks.
14.Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
No Report
BOARD OF APPEALS:
I do have of brief report from the Board of Appeals, they met last night. No appeals from this Commission.
HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:
The HPC reviewed the Department’s Annual Certified Local Government Report, which outlines the historic preservation related activities of the Department and the HPC over the past year.This report to the California Office of Historic Preservation is a requirement of the City & County’s Certified Local Government status. The Mayor’s Office of Housing also provides a separate report to the State regarding its CLG responsibilities.At yesterday’s hearing the Department presented an overview of the document and the HPC‘s comments on the report will be incorporated prior to forwarding to the California Office of Historic Preservation next week.We will forward copies of the final report to both commissions next week. Yesterday the HPC considered the initiation of Landmark Designation forGold Dust Lounge. The item was continued from its Feb. 16 hearing to allow the property owner and the author of the designation report time to address a number of outstanding questions regarding whether or not the lounge is worthy of local landmark designation.A Motion to disapprove the initiation of the Gold Dust failed as well as a Motion to continue the item to a future hearing.A motion was ultimately passed to close the public hearing and continue the item to its April 4 hearing to allow the one absent commissioner an opportunity to vote on the matter. Regardless of HPC’s vote on April 4th, if Supervisor Olague’s separate introduction at the BOS to initiate designation of the Gold Dust lounge moves forward, theHPC would still have to hold a hearing on the designation and vote to recommend approval or disapproval to the BOS.The HPC's hearing on the landmarking initiated by the BOS would need to be within 90 days of referral.
F.PUBLIC COMMENT
At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.In response to public comment, the commission is limited to:
(1)responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or
(2)requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or
