Commissioner Antonini:
Congratulations to Christina Olague.  Even though we often voted different ways,
        Supervisor Olague was always open to discussion and open to compromise, and I
        think someone has said that politics is the art of the possible and she will do
        well because of her attitude in that regard.  Item two: most of you know the
        49ers are playing in an important playoff game against the Saints this Saturday,
        appropriately in San Francisco, at Candlestick Park, which is the site of more
        NFL playoff games than any other stadium in the United States, partly due to the
        great successes of the 49ers in the past. My third item has to do with personal
        experience talking about formula retail. I tried to find a battery, over the
        holidays we have had a land line that had gone out. It is one of those phones
        that is able to be removed from the land line and walked around with. Apparently
        maybe all that is wrong with it is the battery. Unfortunately, Radio Shack did
        not have it and neither did AT&T. I was told to go to Batteries Plus, which I
        think the only one is on a Bush Street near Van Ness Avenue. We have to look at
        some of these conditional uses as additional uses for formula of retail, we have
        to take into consideration issues where if the item is such a specialty item and
        really not realistic to expect your neighborhood hardware store or even another
        formula retail outlet like Radio Shack to have it, there might be a reason for
        it to be that way, and that is you have to have such a huge volume of outlets to
        be able to specialize in only such things as batteries. “We should always view
        our decisions and the prism of how realistic it is that local firms can always
        supply the items of particular institutions supplies. I just wanted to point
        that out. I hope to find a battery some time in the near future.
Commissioner Moore:
I have a list of congratulations. The first one goes to Supervisor Olague. I
        wish her the best of luck. I think it will be fantastic. The second
        congratulation goes to Mayor Lee for his swearing in as a new Mayor. The first
        one of the issue is the thought of establishing a trust fund for affordable
        housing. I read outline in the paper of what that is supposed to entail, and I
        am extremely excited for that being a step in the right direction, something I
        think this Commission will be interested in and help realize. The third
        congratulation goes to Director Rahaim.  He is mentioned in this great article.
        As we see the demise of San Francisco, he has jumped in to establish a new
        oversight office. I am not sure if I am using the proper names, to which one of
        them was named, one of which is Director Rahaim who brings planning expertise,
        including a lot more to anchor a discussion that will require a lot of
        attention, particularly many of the projects that will be worked on at the Board
        for a long time. I see that as a very powerful step in the right direction as we
        all move forward in the discussion of the demise of redevelopment. Not all
        cities are prepared as we are, and I wish everyone luck on this difficult
        journey. I have a comment to make on an ordinance establishing new guidelines
        for performance and other regulations regarding installation and placement of
        wireless communication. The City of Burlingame on Monday implemented a new
        ordinance. I have a copy of the ordinance to pass on.  They were compared with
        eight other cities on what they are doing. I would give AnMarie Rodgers the
        ordinance and encourage her to contact people in their Planning Department to
        see what has been looked at so that our own work can constructively support what
        others have researched. That is, I think, it for me today. I wanted to thank the
        Planning Department for including the Christmas pictures from the party. I
        thought it was very thoughtful. It brought a lot of smiles onto my face. The
        last thing I would like to share is that Piazza Market is closed. They moved the
        catering business to another location.

        Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Happy New Year Everyone!
         It is good to be back. If you will bear with me, I might lose my voice halfway
        through. I am still struggling with a cold. I have several announcements today.
11.Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of
        Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
BOARD OF
        SUPERVISORS:
Dec 2011:This report was to come at the end of last year’s meeting but this info has
        not yet been shared.  In summary, two informational hearings on Planning
        matters were heard by the Board & its committees: 8 Washington and CPMC. 
        There was no action on either and I can give you more information if you
        wish.
I did need to share the results of an appeal hearing concerning the
        Conditional Use authorization of a wireless telecommunications facility as
        the Board’s action included a request to relay this information to the
        Commission.
FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
·Appeal of CU for wireless antennas at3901 Mission Street.This Commission had approved the CU with a 6-0 vote on 11/8. In this case, the
        appellants' questioned the “necessity and desirability” of the installation.
        Again, this project saw very little information presented by the appellant’s at
        the PC hearing, however, the appellants provided a great deal of new information
        to the Board; including a survey claiming that nearly 72% of the neighbors
        opposed the project and an independent assessment by an engineer questioning the
        “gaps” in coverage cited by AT&T.  What had been only 8 ½ minutes of public
        comment at the Commission hearing was over 45 minutes at the Board.  Like last
        another similar appeal the week earlier, Members of the Board were concerned
        about differences in the maps that AT&T presented to the Commission vs. similar
        coverage maps shown by AT&T’s marketing arm which shows good coverage in the
        area.  Supervisor Campos questioned the City’s ability to assess “necessity” of
        new antennas.  He stated that “necessity must be based upon an independent
        analysis” of AT&T’s coverage maps, instead of the unquestioned acceptance of
        these claimed gaps in service.  The Supervisor urged “disapproval” of the CU as
        the Board couldn’t verify the validity of the maps through the information AT&T
        had provided and said the burden is on the project sponsor to prove that
        additional antennas are needed.  Supervisors Wiener, Campos, and Cohen wanted a
        message relayed to this Commission that the Board is increasingly struggling
        with the determination that the antennas are necessary.  These members of the
        Board requested that the Commission and the Department to take note of the
        Board’s recent actions and that we make adjustments in our procedures.
        Specifically, the requested that Planning require an independent evaluation of
        capacity and coverage for future antennae installations, as a matter of regular
        practice.   When it came time to take action, Supervisor Campos wanted to move
        for a disapproval but was 1 vote short of the 8 votes needed (Chu, Farrell, Elsbernd, and Cohen, no votes) 
        Supervisor Wiener  then moved to reject the Commission’s CU but to approve a new
        CU with a the same condition he imposed last week.  This condition would require
        that Planning Staff pick an independent, state-licensed engineer to make an
        objective evaluation of AT&T’s cell coverage in this area.  Planning staff is to
        consult with both the appellants and the project sponsor on this selection and
        any potential consultant would have to sign a confidentiality agreement
        acceptable to AT&T.  If this evaluator finds a gap that would be improved by the
        new antennas the CU will be approved.  If there is no gap or a gap that is not
        improved by this antennae installation, the antennas will be disapproved.   
        AT&T will fund the costs charged by this independent evaluator.With that new
        condition, the Board voted unanimously 11-0 to add this to the Conditional Use
        authorization.  In response to the Board’s new condition, the Department has
        been in consultation with the appellants and project sponsor.  We will be making
        the final selection on the Larkin appeal by COB today.  In addition, the
        Department will be presenting the Commission with a draft policy proposal that
        would make the Board’s new condition regarding independent verification of
        coverage and capacity data a standard component of future applications.  While
        this new policy can’t be discussed in detail today as this has not been
        publically noticed, later on the calendar you will hear WTS cases and may
        determine if you wish to apply add the Board’s new condition to the other
        conditions included in our case report.
THIS WEEK:
LAND USE COMMITTEE:
·1% for Art Requirement.The Planning
        Commission considered this Ordinance on 10/27.  This week at Committee Board
        President Chiu introduced the changes requested by this Commission.  The major
        modifications of note include the activation of large ground floor open spaces
        with artworks and expanding the requirement Citywide.  These changes were made
        after the Supervisor and Mayor’s Office conducted additional outreach as
        requested by this Commission.  Until the outreach meeting, the Ordinance would
        have only required on-site art for non-residential buildings with a groundfloor
        open space of >3000 sf.  The Department’s survey of potential pipeline projects
        showed this to be a very low number of projects.  Now, the on-site requirement
        will be expanded so that projects with an open space requirement of 1500-3000 sf
        will be required to spend a minimum of $500,000 on-site and projects with open
        spaces of 3000 sf or larger will be required to spend $750,000 on-site.Mayor’s Office staff spoke in support of this change.  Supervisor Chiu also
        amended the ordinance to apply to all projects but at a higher threshold outside
        of the C-3.  The existing threshold for the C-3 would not change from the
        existing minimum project size of 25,000 sq ft.  Outside of the C-3 the
        requirement would not be triggered unless a new building or addition were
        greater than 75,000 sf.  Mayor’s Office staff said that the Mayor had not yet
        had time to consider this amendment.  Since this amendment will expand a
        potential fee, the item will not be heard for two weeks while the Clerk of the
        Board performs the required notice.
FULL BOARD HEARING:
·M&O CAC Members.Supervisor Elsbernd divided the motion to nominate new members to the Market &
        Octavia CAC.  He asked that the Board vote on all nominations but for Peter
        Cohen.  He asked that Cohen's nomination be sent back to committee for further
        discussion.  Specifically, Supervisor Elsbernd stated that at the Committee
        hearing Mr. Cohen stated that he had been nominated for the low-income seat but
        that he was not low-income.  The Board voted unanimously to nominate the
        following parties to the M&O CAC: Krute Singa, Michael Simmons, Kenneth Wingard,
        Dennis Richards, and Jason Henderson to terms ending December 16, 2012.  On the
        motion to send Mr. Cohen's nomination back to committee, this motion passed by a
        6-5 vote.  Voting against were Supervisors Avalos, Campos, Kim, Mar, and
        Olague.  The Rules Committee will rehear this nomination in the near-term.
·SharpPark Management Plan.The Board also considered overturning a veto.  Over recess the Mayor had vetoed
        the Sharp Park Management Plan Ordinance sponsored by Supervisor Avalos.  This
        week the Board voted on whether they should override his veto.  To override, a
        super majority of 8 votes are needed.  The override failed with only six votes:
        Avalos, Campos, Chiu, Kim, Mar and newly appointed Olague.
·CEQA Appeal.The Board heard an appeal to the Commission's certification of the Museum of
        Modern Art Expansion/Fire Station Relocation and Housing Project Environmental
        Impact Report. The Appellant, the W Hotel, alleged 3 primary arguments:
1.that the EIR  and the project analyzed in the EIR did not match the schematic
        design submitted to the Department
2.that the expansion's visual impacts were not appropriately analyzed,
        particularly those related to effects on private views to the W hotel; and
3.that loading, access and circulation effects during construction and the
        project condition were insufficiently evaluated in the EIR.
Staff responded to these claims and on a unanimous vote, the Board upheld the
        commission's certification and denied the appeal. The Board subsequently voted
        unanimously to adopt the rezoning ordinances for the 676 Howard Street and 935
        Folsom Street parcels. The project will be back before this commission for an
        approval hearing on February 2.

·Motion appointing Peter Cohen, term ending December 16, 2012, to the Market and
        Octavia Community Advisory Committee.
BOARD OF APPEALS:
One item of interest was a
        jurisdiction request. The Commission heard this in 2010. The building permit was
        issued in 2011. Construction work commenced after that. An adjacent neighbor
        filed the jurisdiction request in December, because they had concerns about the
        scope of the work. It is our understanding that the work being performed is per
        plan, as was in the plans. Also, the request for had filed a letter of support
        when the item was before you. It seems that as the project was being constructed
        it was not as they had visualized from seeing the plan. They had concerns and
        wanted the scope of the project reduced. That shows the importance of explaining
        clearly what the scope of the project is, not everyone can understand the plans.
        Other items related to the Board of Appeals -- there will be some changes in the
        composition of the Board in December. Former President Tanya Peterson resigned.
        She is the Executive Director of the San Francisco Zoo. She has been doing an
        excellent job there and will be focusing full time on that position, an
        important position. Last night, current President Goh resigned from the Board of
        Appeals. She will be sitting for next week's hearing, but has announced she is
        moving to Beijing to take a new position which sounds exciting. We wish her the
        best, as well as Commissioner Peterson. During the years I have been observing
        them on the Board, I am impressed by their integrity and attention to detail. I
        wish them both the best in their endeavors. In terms of replacement
        Commissioners, Ms. Peterson was appointed by the Mayor, who has nominated Rich
        Hillis from the Office of Work Force Development. He left that office last year
        and is now the Executive Director of Mason Center. He has been nominated and
        will be undergoing a review and approval process for that. President Goh was a
        Board appointee and we have no word of a replacement for her.
