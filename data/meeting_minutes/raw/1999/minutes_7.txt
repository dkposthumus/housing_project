REVISION TO THE CONDITIONAL USE ABATEMENT
PLANNING CODE AMENDMENT,Consideration of a proposal to initiate a revision to a
proposed amendment to the Planning Code previously initiated by the Planning
Commission and recommended for adoption by the Commission on October 7, 1999
but not heard by the Board of Supervisors. That proposal and this revision
would amend Section 303 to clarify the appeal delay in the effective date of a
conditional use approval and to provide a process for abating conditional uses
which violate their conditions of approval or have become a public nuisance.
The process would involve a public hearing to consider revoking the conditional
use permit, modifying conditions of approval or taking other abatement action
and would include an opportunity to appeal a decision to the Board of
Supervisors. The current, proposed revisions would delete the provision whereby
tenants would be allowed to sign an appeal petition, due to the difficulty of
recording, counting and noticing tenants; would delete language that implied
that the procedure would not apply to conditional uses that were “grand
fathered in”; and would require notice of the abatement hearing to be sent to
the permit holder by regular mail as well as certified mail. The original
amendment provided only for certified mail notification. Testimony and
Commission considerations could result in recommendations of modifications to
the proposed legislation.

REVISION TO THE CONDITIONAL USE ABATEMENT PLANNING CODE AMENDMENT,Consideration of a
proposal to initiate a revision to a proposed amendment to the Planning Code
previously initiated by the Planning Commission and recommended for adoption by
the Commission on October 7, 1999 but not heard by the Board of Supervisors.
That proposal and this revision would amend Section 303 to clarify the appeal
delay in the effective date of a conditional use approval and to provide a
process for abating conditional uses which violate their conditions of approval
or have become a public nuisance. The process would involve a public hearing to
consider revoking the conditional use permit, modifying conditions of approval
or taking other abatement action and would include an opportunity to appeal a
decision to the Board of Supervisors. The current, proposed revisions would
delete the provision whereby tenants would be allowed to sign an appeal
petition, due to the difficulty of recording, counting and noticing tenants;
would delete language that implied that the procedure would not apply to
conditional uses that were “grand fathered in”; and would require notice of the
abatement hearing to be sent to the permit holder by regular mail as well as
certified mail. The original amendment provided only for certified mail
notification. Testimony and Commission considerations could result in
recommendations of modifications to the proposed legislation.
(Continued
from Regular Meeting of December 2, 1999).
SPEAKER(S):None
ACTION:Approved as amended:
Page 9, line 25 - add “substantial”
Page 10, line 1 - instead of “of a public nuisance created by the
conditional use which...” put in “...violations of applicable law and the
violations (have not)...
A decision by the Planning Commission to revoke a conditional use,
to modify conditions or placement of conditional conditions on a conditional
use or a decision by the Planning Commission refusing to revoke or amend a
conditional use may be appealed.
Page 10, line 25 - shouldn’t it be better to have it not take
effect until the appeal period is over or until an appeal is settled.

spaces where 329 are required by the Planning Code. The project would require
