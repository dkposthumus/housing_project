levels above with 27 residential units (about 22,900 square feet).   Loading for the
commercial occupancy would be on Buchanan Street.  The project height would not exceed 
40 feet, and would have a total gross area of about 60,600 square feet.  This would be
constructed after the demolition of the existing 2,300 square foot building with drive through.

be converted from vacant food manufacturing to 122,500 square feet of office use, with 134

considered by the Planning Commission as a Planned Unit Development, and would
require exceptions to Planning Code parking requirements and bulk limits, as well as

square-foot building on an approximate 55,770 square-foot site.  A paved parking lot
currently occupies the project site.  The project would require Conditional Use Authorization

than the accessory use amount.  (Since the PND was published, the project sponsor has
revised the project to consist of 200 dwelling units instead of 68 live/work units and 142

proposed project consisting of new construction of 68 live/work units up to 142 dwelling

within an 85-foot tall, eight-story (plus two mezzanine levels), approximately 390,300 gross
square-foot building on an approximate 55,770 square-foot site.  A paved parking lot
currently occupies the project site.  The project would require Conditional Use Authorization
by the Planning Commission for the proposed height, building bulk, and parking greater
than the accessory use amount.  (Since the PND was published, the project sponsor has
revised the project to consist of 200 dwelling units instead of 68 live/work units and 142
dwelling units.  Hence, a Variance from the rear yard requirement would need to be granted
by the Zoning Administrator.)(Continued from Regular Meeting of

STREET, (Proposed Residential/Commercial Development).  The
proposal is to construct one building on a 16,500 square foot lot at the corner of Buchanan

The proposal is to construct parking for 46 parking spaces at the basement level and 3
parking spaces at street level, 11,000 square feet of retail space at the street level, and two
levels above with 27 residential units (about 22,900 square feet).   Loading for the
commercial occupancy would be on Buchanan Street.  The project height would not exceed 
40 feet, and would have a total gross area of about 60,600 square feet.  This would be
constructed after the demolition of the existing 2,300 square foot building with drive through. 
 Vehicle access to the parking garage would be via Lombard Street.  This proposed project
is located in an NC-3  (Moderate Scale, Neighborhood Commercial) zoning
district.(Proposed for

Declarationpublished for the proposed addition to and adaptive reuse of an existing

formerly part of the Best Foods complex.  The project site is on the north side of Mariposa
Street, extending from Bryant Street to Florida Street; Assessor's Block 3970, Lots 3 & 4. 
Two stories would be added to the existing structure, bringing the roof of the proposed
building to a height of 65 feet, as measured from Bryant Street.  The entire building would
be converted from vacant food manufacturing to 122,500 square feet of office use, with 134
tandem parking spaces at the basement and mezzanine level.  The project would be
considered by the Planning Commission as a Planned Unit Development, and would
require exceptions to Planning Code parking requirements and bulk limits, as well as
authorization under Planning Code Section 321 as an office development.  The project site
is within the Greater Northeast Mission Industrial Zone (NEMIZ).(Proposed for

proposal is to construct one building on a 16,500 square foot lot at the corner of Buchanan
Street after demolition of the present fast-food establishment (Assessor's Block 494, lot 12).
The proposal is to construct parking for 46 parking spaces at the basement level and 3
parking spaces at street level, 11,000 square feet of retail space at the street level, and two
levels above with 27 residential units (about 22,900 square feet).   Loading for the
commercial occupancy would be on Buchanan Street.  The project height would not exceed 
40 feet, and would have a total gross area of about 60,600 square feet.  This would be
constructed after the demolition of the existing 2,300 square foot building with drive through. 
 Vehicle access to the parking garage would be via Lombard Street.  This proposed project
is located in an NC-3  (Moderate Scale, Neighborhood Commercial) zoning
district.(Proposed for

Declarationpublished for the proposed addition to and adaptive reuse of an existing

formerly part of the Best Foods complex.  The project site is on the north side of Mariposa
Street, extending from Bryant Street to Florida Street; Assessor's Block 3970, Lots 3 & 4. 
Two stories would be added to the existing structure, bringing the roof of the proposed
building to a height of 65 feet, as measured from Bryant Street.  The entire building would
be converted from vacant food manufacturing to 122,500 square feet of office use, with 134
tandem parking spaces at the basement and mezzanine level.  The project would be
considered by the Planning Commission as a Planned Unit Development, and would
require exceptions to Planning Code parking requirements and bulk limits, as well as
authorization under Planning Code Section 321 as an office development.  The project site
is within the Greater Northeast Mission Industrial Zone (NEMIZ).(Proposed for

proposal is to construct one building on a 16,500 square foot lot at the corner of Buchanan

parking spaces at street level, 11,000 square feet of retail space at the street level, and two
levels above with 27 residential units (about 22,900 square feet).   Loading for the
commercial occupancy would be on Buchanan Street.  The project height would not exceed 
40 feet, and would have a total gross area of about 60,600 square feet.  This would be
constructed after the demolition of the existing 2,300 square foot building with drive through. 
 Vehicle access to the parking garage would be via Lombard Street.  This proposed project
is located in an NC-3  (Moderate Scale, Neighborhood Commercial) zoning

be converted from vacant food manufacturing to 122,500 square feet of office use, with 134
tandem parking spaces at the basement and mezzanine level.  The project would be
considered by the Planning Commission as a Planned Unit Development, and would
require exceptions to Planning Code parking requirements and bulk limits, as well as
authorization under Planning Code Section 321 as an office development.  The project site
is within the Greater Northeast Mission Industrial Zone (NEMIZ).
