4.Commission Comments/Questions
Commission Antonini:
I've had the pleasure of attending some of the President's Cup.I think it's a wonderful post card of San Francisco that's going out to probably a billion people world wide and it's only appropriate as the Mayor said yesterday that we are the birth place of the United Nations.It's a great event.But there is a land use issue that a lot of people aren't aware of and that is the fact one of the added benefits of this tournament is the fact that we have been able to established the first tee in an inner-city area, in the Visitacion Valley area, which will be a great [or] give access to a lot of young people in San Francisco and throughout the Bay Area to develop skills for golf.This is a wonderful program and I think it is something that has often in the attention we give to the more glamorous aspect of the tournament, this is one that a lot of people don't know about but it was pointed out yesterday and I think it was a great benefit.I was very happy to see that happen.
Commissioner Sugaya:
Two things:One, I did enquire with the City Attorney's Office about a legal case in Los Angeles that addresses affordable housing regulations in the State or at least in Los Angeles.It's somewhat alarming.The Superior Court has concluded that as applied to a proposed project, the city of Los Angeles Affordable Housing Ordinance conflicts with and is pre-empted by the vacancy de-control provisions of the [Costa Hawkins Rental Housing Act].This I believe, according to the City Attorney's Office, is being [rather] they have requested that the California Supreme Court to hear it.Ms. Susan Cleveland-Knowles has informed us that that took place around the first of September but the Supreme Court has not rendered its decision.It's probably a little too complicated to go into here and it is requested to be heard by a higher court.I think the City Attorney's Office will keep us informed on this and what affect it might have on the city's affordable housing regulations.
The second thing is last week there was a discussion, which I kind of missed because I got confused on whether it was Proposition D or whether it was the report done on the Neighborhood Commercial Districts, so I didn't say anything.But I'd just like to say that I think that the Commission should have an informational hearing on the memorandum that was crafted by staff with respect to this particular Proposition.I say that simply because there is no other public forum for this particular memo to come forth I suppose unless somebody wants to write an [op-ed] piece or something like that.If commissioners feel that they can't make objective comments, they can just not say anything and we can just have a hearing and that would be it.But it would at least give some public airing to I think a memorandum that was very well crafted and objectively looks at the implications of the ordinance back on existing sign ordinances and the way it would be administered, presumably not by the city, I think is the way it was written, but I haven't completely read it.That's just my opinion.
Commissioner Olague:
I would like the information that is out so far on the affordable housing case in Los Angeles.Susan Cleveland-Knowles – if she can forward it to me because I thought it was going to be something that was going to be raised here today.But obviously not, so I would like whatever information you have on it.
Deputy City Attorney Susan Cleveland-Knowles:
There are several published summaries of the case that I can send to you from different perspectives and I can send you the case itself.Again, it's not a final decision at this point.We'll update you as soon as we hear from the California Supreme Court about whether they have accepted review or declined review of the case.
Commissioner Olague:
Thank you because I think it's important, and thank you Commissioner Sugaya for pointing it out.
I also thought we should have a Prop D discussion here.I know there was some concern that we never brought these issues before this commission, but Prop 98, we had a discussion.That was a statewide measure and then there were a couple of other local measures that we discussed here objectively.I would support having a public [hearing].Again, I agree with Commissioner Sugaya's comments on that, but it's up to the rest of the commission.
Finally, I meant to get here sooner because someone who did a lot of community work in the South of Market area, particularly around housing, he was an activist.Frequently activist – flags aren't flown at half mast for them, but without their presence and their involvement the city wouldn't be what it is.There was a gentleman, John Malone who was very active in the South of Market community.Me and Mr. Meko both worked with him and I would ask that we close the meeting in his honor today.He was very active in SOM PAC and other South of Market planning issues.
Commissioner Borden:
I have a question for the Zoning Administrator.I was attending the Marina Merchants Association meeting this week and there was a space on Chestnut Street that T-Mobil has gotten building permits to actually do work to a building space but they have not filed for a conditional use formula retail.I was wondering how that could happen.
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
Well, let me speculate.They didn't tell us they were a formula retail?If you would give me the address we will look into it.It is they could be taking a risk.If the facts are that, that they decided that they wanted to go ahead and do improvements and were going to come in soon for a formula retail, perhaps they did not understand that they should do formula retail, or perhaps there are some mitigating circumstances that I don't understand.
Commissioner Borden:
I was wondering because it is my understanding that when someone comes in, they get a building permit and they get asked that question or questions similar to it and then at that point they would get an application.Are they then still able to get their building permit even though they have a conditional use?
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
No.They are actually asked to self-identify.There is a questionnaire that I think is given out to almost every building permit application that is a retail occupancy change.They should have filled that out and we should have looked it.I can't begin to speculate on whether the permit may not have been referred to us by DBI, I'm not blaming DBI.
Commissioner Borden:
But you're just saying they wouldn't be able to get a permit if they had & .
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
I don't think they should have gotten a permit if they were identified as a formula retail use.If you would give me the address, we will pursue it.
Commissioner Miguel:
Thank you Commissioner Borden.Hopefully that is part of what the new computer system will solve in the future, although it should be taken care of now.
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
It really depends on self-identification.Someone has to understand and agree with us that we believe that they are formula retail.It doesn't always happen.We've seen a number of cases recently where you've got subsidiaries.The question becomes is that subsidiary the Ralph Lauren something?Ultimately, I would determine that was formula retail.There is a similar thing going on with Brooks Brothers where I've ultimately determined they're formula retail.They are actually coming in.They didn't agree, but they are coming in as a formula retail.It's not crystal clear and we said it wasn't and there would be errors.I don't want to disparage anyone.We just don't know what happened yet.I'm not blaming DBI in the slightest, or even the project sponsor.
Commissioner Antonini:
A couple of things:I guess I would also like to have more information on that Los Angeles decision.One would assume that whatever form it arrives at in its final version it would have statewide application, is that correct?Because it would be a president setting decision, is that what we are hearing on this?
Deputy City Attorney Susan Cleveland-Knowles:
If the Court of Appeal decision is left to stand in that district Court of Appeals – it's one district out of several districts so if another Appellant Court were to make a different decision then there would be a split of authority.Obviously if the California Supreme Court hears the case, then that decision would apply statewide.And generally until there is another Court of Appeal case, the Second District Court of Appeal case would stand and apply statewide.
Commissioner Antonini:
Thank you. It is valuable to have that presentation so we know how decisions – they're jurisdiction are applies.
In regards to the discussion on Prop D:I do remember the Prop 98 discussion that was already on the ballot.I believe, if memory serves me right, most of the other measures we've discussed here at the Planning Commission have been in the crafting stages and the stage where they weren't the final versions that were on the ballot.I think that is an area where we have to be very careful if we do have any public hearing on a measure that is already there, that it informational only and that it be an objective presentation that deals with land use concerns regarding a particular issue.That would be my feeling on it.I don't know that we need to have a discussion on it, but I wanted to weigh in.
Commissioner Olague:
I think a couple of weeks ago Commissioner Moore raised the issue of having an update on the Academy of Art because we had all been receiving these emails.I was wondering if that is ever going to come up.Is it going to be calendared?
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
I did have some discussions with staff about that and I thought that we were aiming for late October, but I doubt that Ms. Avery knows that and I really need to follow up again.I know after you asked, I followed up on it and I don't remember when we had decided to schedule to schedule it.I'm sorry.
Commissioner Moore:
Commissioner Olague I appreciate you bringing that up because I would like to bring that discussion into the examination as to whether or not the east bound closing of Market Street really works and how the excessive impact of Academy buses of all kinds of sizes further impedes the neighborhood streets, which were brought to our attention 10/8, 6, & 4.Mr. Badiner I'm not sure if you've gotten any progress report, I go down Market Street frequently.I still see people in private cars driving on the east side in the direction of the Ferry Building, so I'm not sure as to whether or not the implementation of this experimental measure is really working.
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
I honestly haven't been tracking it.As I said, I believe after 90 days – it was a trial period and we were going to provide you with the report that MTA had come up with.We have not been monitoring it on a daily basis.I'm sure MTA has, but we haven't.
Commissioner Moore:
The street feels good with fewer cars, but I think if people would be fined there would be a great resource for revenue because there are still quite a few people doing it.
Commissioner Miguel:
I'd just like to mention that I have had during the last week discussions regarding Articles 10 & 11 as to the Historic Preservation Commission.I have had discussions on the Hope SF Program regarding both Presidio Terrace and Sunnydale Housing – both of which are in progress; with Sutter regarding CPMC; as well as people on projects Lombard and California Streets.I've also been following, as obviously several of the commissioners have, the legal action down south on inclusionary housing.It will be interesting to see how far that goes – whether it stays with the Appeals Court down there, just in that jurisdiction – or it goes up to the State Supreme Court to cover everybody.At least we'll know for sure pretty soon whether or not they are going to take the case and go further with it.My information is that they probably will take the case.
5.Director's Announcements
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
Commissioners, I have two items that I'd like to bring to your attention.Director Rahaim is on a well deserved vacation and will be back next week and the first [item] is variances.Commissioners, as you are aware, most variances are heard by me in a separate hearing.But sometimes when there is a hearing before you, often DR or sometimes CU, we hold the variance hearing here for the convenience of the public and project sponsors and staff because frankly so we don't have two duplicative hearings.It is my practice when I hold the individual variance hearings to make an announcement and say that there is a sign-up sheet over on the left and please sign up if you are interested in receiving the Variance Hearing Decision Letter so you can preserve your rights of appeal.I haven't done that in the past here because there are so many different appeal processes and often people who are here on projects are somewhat more sophisticated than purely on variance hearings.It has been raised that that is something I should do and I think it is a good idea.So in the future if we were hearing for example today the 448 Pennsylvania Avenue case, prior to the hearing I would say,  There is a sign-up sheet over there on the left of the room.Please sign up if you want to preserve your rights of appeal.After the Decision Letter if crafted, you will be mailed a copy of the Decision Letter and will have ten (10) days to appeal to the Board of Appeals.I will do that in the future.
The second point I would like to make is I issued an unusual emergency alteration permit today.Usually they are emergency demolition permits.As you are aware, residential buildings and preservations buildings need to go through a complete process including neighborhood notification and often discretionary review before you commissioners.But there is an exception where the Department of Building Inspection has determined there is imminent safety hazard.Those imminent safety hazards, in every case that I am aware of, has resulted in a demolition permit being issued.But in this case, on Saturday, there were high winds and this building was under construction.The ground floor had been re-habed and highly strengthened.The building was open above that.The wind came in and essentially blew the top off.Today I issued the emergency authorization permit.It probably would characterize as tantamount to demolition under our things.I hope commissioners, although it's not necessary, that you would agree with me that that is a valid permit to issue in this case.The project sponsor, I understand from Director Day, wanted a demolition permit.But she said that no you can keep the bottom and rebuild the top and please don't exceed the scope of the permit again.That was an editorial comment.Director Day didn't say that.
Commissioner Miguel:
Thank you regarding the variance sign-up Mr. Badiner.I have been copied on most of that email correspondence and I think it complies with the intent of being able to be on the list in order to make an appeal.I think it's very consistent.
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
I think so too and I think credit should go where credit is due.Steve Williams suggested it and I think it was a good suggestion and we followed it and I appreciate that.
