6.Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Moore:
I just want to share with everybody what I believe is a great story.Parks and Rec, as we all know, like many other city institutions, is under severe financial constraints.Every year Huntington Park has a lighting program which is almost like a signature piece, particularly around the holidays when there is city wide attendance as at Grace Cathedral.All the neighbors were all upset because it was not going to happen this year.And just apparently last week, the Huntington Hotel stepped in to make it possible that the lights were on.I thought it was so great at a time where everybody really doesnât have anything and say we will do it.And I just want to mention that.
Commissioner Antonini:
I want to point out that in Wednesdayâs Chronicle, an article by John King,Getting Around Cheaper in San Francisco than in the Suburbs,they did a little survey â how much people spent per year in transportation costs and there was quite a remarkable difference between the amount being spent by city residents and those is some of the suburban areas.I guess there are a couple of reasons.The first reason was that presumably the people in the suburbs have to go further to get to anything or many things and so they are traveling a lot more to their jobs or to other things; and second of all, we have some transportation which is lacking in other places.The point of my comments is that there have been State laws passed that encourage building near public transit and I think this is more evidence of that and it would be very helpful as we try to build new in-fill housing in San Francisco with these kinds of figures and being aware of this information.
Commissioner Olague:
I have been receiving a lot of emails about the Calaveras Dam issue and extending the comment period.Is that something that we would need to address next week when the item comes up?
Commissioner Sugaya:
Last weekâs packet had an Annual Report from the Board of Appeals which I found to be extremely interesting.I think weâre supposed to do one ourselves, arenât we?
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
Yes, and itâs in final draft phases and itâs at the printer.
Commissioner Sugaya:
Terrific.I attended part of the ULI conference last night that is going on in San Francisco.I think there were six or seven Planning Directors from around the country on a panel and they were asked three or four questions.I found it extremely interesting to see what the answers were from the various communities.It was New York, San Diego, Portland, Seattle, Vancouver, and Minneapolis I believe were represented as well as John Rahaim from San Francisco.I learned a lot.I liked the Vancouver manâs answer to a specific question that had to do with the relationship of planning the Planning Departments and Real Estate and developers and their communities.They started off by saying that well in Vancouver and Canada we donât have as much private property rights issues as you do in the United States and we have fewer lawyers, which was a lead in to his answer which was that even though that was the case, they did have to cooperate with developers obviously because the private sector builds most of the city anyway.I got the feeling they were able to operate from a much stronger position â maybe [with] politically and regulatory matters so that they had a little better hand to play when it came to negotiations and being cooperative and all that stuff.
Commissioner Borden:
Speaking of the Chronicle, they had an article in the paper this week that was extraordinarily pessimistic about the zoning environment and I just wanted to know what we are seeing for application filings right now because it really sounds like they were saying that no one is going to be developing anything for a very long time.Weâve done a lot of extensions â only one year extensions â on some of the entitlements too and Iâm just kind of concerned if this is right.I know the current markets are really slow and I just want to know where we are.
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
We have done a variety of different extensions.In Rincon Hill the code only allows a one year extension.The Commission has seen a variety of other projects that have come before you and youâve granted â I want to say up to three years but Iâm not sure that is accurate â on other projects.We are not seeing major projects come in.I canât speak categorically because I havenât goon through the numbers.Our numbers are down from our projections slightly.It is something we are looking and we are concerned about.The economy is bad as I think the Commission understands and the fact that you are here every Thursday until late, people are still seeking entitlements.They are using this time period to get their entitlements in place, but they are not necessarily pursuing building permits.It is a very tough economic time.Iâve been at ULI also and Iâve heard some of the discussion there.It is a very pleasant conference but itâs not a very happy conference.Iâll talk a little bit more under Directorâs Report.I canât be overly optimistic that we will see a lot of building right now.Weâre holding steady but we are lower than we would like to be on our applications that are coming in.
Commissioner Moore:
I want to ask Commissioner Sugaya to share a comment about last night regarding Director Amanda Burton from New York and the Planning Commission speaking their mind rather than being restrained, constrained by whatever it might be including taking on mediocre architecture which is not at all in the spirit of that city.
Commission Secretary Avery:
Commissioner Sugaya, before you make that comment, let me just remind all of you that this is not on your calendar.
Commissioner Sugaya:
I think Commissioner Moore just said it succinctly.It was an observation by [many speakers at once â comments were unclear] it was both I think and reinforced that.They felt that Planning Directors, planners, and probably by extension, Commissioners should be forceful in terms of expressing their own opinions and be cognizant or supporting good planning policies in the face of perhaps what might be political considerations and other influences coming our direction.It was also interesting to here when they were asked what their favorite cities might be outside of their own, the answers were Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Singapore and Sydney â all outside of the United States.There was mention of Chicago and Barcelona.
Commissioner Lee:
I want to follow up with Commissioner Bordenâs question.I think the article probably pinpoints exactly where we are.Last week or two weeks ago, Shorenstein with another investor, is spending a billion dollars to invest in another county but not in San Francisco.I donât know why he is doing that.The W Hotel was bought up by a Hong Kong group at half price from the peek when it was first sold.It was like $86 million, they bought if for $43 million.A lot of people in the city donât understand.That means our tax base for that hotel per year drops in half.If this trend continues, the value of city property will definitely drop, which will decrease our tax base.If you are a builder, why should you build a building when it is so expensive when you can buy it on the cheap since credit is so good?Iâm a little disappointed that Shorenstein is building in the South Bay a billion dollars with another company but not investing or building in the city and he owns property here that he could build.â¦ I think we see yellow lights here and I think people in the city better start looking at whatâs going to happen in the future.
Commissioner Antonini:
I also saw that article and I thought it might have singled out San Francisco too much because I think there are a lot of vacancies in commercial properties throughout the Bay Area, in fact probably worse in the South Bay from what I can tell.We probably have a higher concentration of commercial properties, particularly for business here so the affects are a little more.The one golden lining, if there is any, is there have been a couple of companies who have relocated or located to San Francisco because now commercial rents are lower and they can be where they wanted to be before.I hope this will cycle as things do and demands will begin to increase because the rents are more attractive now.
Commissioner Miguel:
I was also at the ULI spin off last night down in the North Light Court that Director Rahaim put together.What I found very interesting among the seven Planning Directors â and he indicated because of their titles â some of them are in charge of all the environmental as well; some are in charge of the economics of the city and county as well.There was one who is head of the Department and the Commission at the same time.The variety among their actual positions, authority, and coverage was just amazing.We tend to think of what we know here, but it is not the same all over the country.Other than that, they rented 200 chairs and it was standing room only for 50 people probably.It was very well attended and an excellent situation.
Last week Real Estate section in the San Francisco Business Times had a article insert âMega Project Makeovers â Ten Giant Developments That Could Recreate the Bay Area.âSix of them are in actual San Francisco.There are very brief articles on them.Hunters Point, which we heard this morning, Park Merced, Pier 70, Schledge Lock, Transbay, Treasure Island â so in keeping with our previous conversation, there is a lot in the works but itâs going to be a little while.
The other thing is as was mentioned a few weeks ago; the San Francisco Planning Commission was the recipient of the Housing Action Coalitionâs Housing Hero Award.From Senator Mark Leno there is a Certificate of Recognition to the 2009 San Francisco Planning Commission:âCongratulations on being honored as 2009 Housing heroes by the San Francisco Housing Action Coalition.I commend your dedication to increasing affordable housing and expanding housing opportunities for members of our community.I further commend your leadership in the effort to create a city that strives to offer housing opportunities for everyone without regard to income or social status.It is through the work of organizations such as yours that the future becomes brighter for all.Congratulations and thank you for all you do!âSenator Mark Leno.You might as well keep that in the Departmentâs archives or the Commissionâs archives
Commissioner Sugaya:
He is writing a bill to appropriate $50 million dollars for San Francisco housing I assume.

NEW IRVINGTON TUNNEL PROJECT-Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report -The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) is proposing the New Irvington Tunnel Project (also known as âNITâ).
