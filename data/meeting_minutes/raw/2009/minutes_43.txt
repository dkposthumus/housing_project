COMMISSIONERSâ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
4.         
Commission Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements.  
Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or 
inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.  
At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a 
Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda 
of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Borden:
There was an Article in the San Francisco Business Times this week regarding the 
vacancies on Union Street.  There are currently 18 vacancies and there will be 
25 by the end of June assuming no new storefronts are occupied.  One of the 
people quoted in the article was a real estate person who owns their building 
and they were talking about how landlords need to work on lowering the rent 
rates and knowing what the rates are.  This is a great opportunity to start 
looking at the hearings we talked about doing for neighborhood commercial 
corridors because there are a lot of properties that are managed by property 
management companies and the ownersâ don/t know what the climate or the 
conditions are on these corridors or the city in general.  The Department of the 
Environment has a great website where anyone in the city can go and look up 
their address and look at the opportunity to put solar panels on their home; 
what the viability would be; what the different light would be throughout the 
day; etc.  I think the website is sfsolarcity.org, but itâs on the Department of 
the Environmentâs website.  I thought it was interesting and that we should 
promote it.
Commissioner Olague:
She 
thanked the Department for putting together the earlier hearing on 
transportation issues.  In the future she would like the Director and more 
planners to attend.  It was an excellent presentation.  We have received 
correspondence regarding 1250 Missouri and perhaps Mr. Badiner, we can follow up 
on that.  If it comes to the point where we do have a public hearing, I would 
request that it come from our body so as not to put the burden on the public in 
terms of having to file a DR.  In a recent blog, I think I was mis-quoted or 
taken out of context or something, so I want to put out a disclaimer that I have 
a very good relationship with the City Attorneyâs Office.  Dennis Herrera has 
been very impartial and very helpful to me when Iâve had questions and concerns 
about things that pertain to being on this commission.  At some point in the 
future I would like to talk with President Miguel and the City Attorney about 
how enforcement takes place and the role of the City Attorneyâs Office.  I think 
there are still some enforcement issues that are outstanding.  About a year ago 
I asked for a hearing on incompatible activities because I donât really 
understand it that well.  We keep getting memos on it and I canât ask questions 
of a memo.  Itâs overwhelming to me.  (Commission Secretary Avery responded that 
a public hearing could be set up to provide information to the Commission if 
that is desired, or individual or small group briefings could also be arranged.  
Commissioner Moore was the only other commissioner who indicated the desire to 
also be briefed.)
Commissioner Antonini:
He 
thanked staff for a very informative meeting on discretionary review reform last 
night.  On Monday he first met with the project sponsor of 429 Beal/430 Maine 
Street.  Immediately afterward he met with a concerned neighbor.  He felt both 
meetings were very fruitful.
Commissioner Moore:
As 
follow up to what Commissioner Antonini said, there will be another meeting on 
DR where commissioners will be briefed, but I had asked that there be a briefing 
where the public could listen also.  At this point, I am asking for an informal 
morning meeting on DR that is broadcast where the public could attend and 
participate.  Also, I attended a meeting with the sponsors of Trinity Plaza.  It 
was important to the extent that I was moved and inspired by the high quality of 
commitment in that building.  That meeting was also attended by Commissioner 
Borden.  Also, I have been bombarded with a flood of emails on the Masonic 
Auditorium.  I will take a tour of that facility on Monday.
Commissioner Miguel:
Regarding the project at 430 Maine, I have met with the project sponsor and some 
of the neighbors.  Iâve also met regarding 1960 Market; Drew School; and the DR 
reform meeting was very informative.  Iâve also met with people regarding 2929 
Green.  There was a public meeting the other night regarding Potrero housing â 
the rebuild of the public housing there.  It was extremely well attended 
including a large number of the tenants.  I had an interesting call regarding 
1250 Missouri.   They wanted to know why they couldnât put offices there.
Commissioner Antonini:
I 
also went by o see the project at 2929 Green
Commissioner Olague:
Is 
there anyone in the Department who can explain to me how tenancies in common 
work?  There was a building in my neighborhood that went from being sold as a 
single unit building that is now being sold as individual multiple units.
5.Directorâs Announcements
Director Rahaim:
This past week I 
attended a meeting of the West of Twin Peaks Neighborhood Council, which is a 
consortium of 17 organizations on the west side.  There discussion around the 
Housing Element and DR reform.  On the Housing Element, I want to mention that 
we are in the phase where we are going out to communities all over the city.  We 
have 22 meetings scheduled in the neighborhoods in the next three months.  I 
want to repeat the invitation to community organizations for us to come out to 
their meetings to talk about the Housing Element.  Our current schedule is to 
have a draft available in July.  We are a little behind the State required 
schedule, but the State is aware of it and are pleased with our progress we are 
making.

Service Useâ and related amendments to authorize this use in the Upper Fillmore 
NCD.
.           Maxwell:  090317 â A resolution requesting a hearing on the status 
of the Bike Plan EIR and schedule for Plan adoption.  This hearing will take 
place next Monday at the Land Use Committee.
BOARD OF APPEALS
365 Fulton Street, 
a project initially approved by the Redevelopment Agency.  The zoning has 
changed from Western Addition A to NCT-3.  On 2/11 the Board upheld that permit 
requiring a âgood neighborâ plan.  The good neighbor policies were of concern at 
this hearing.  The Deputy City Attorney cautioned the Board that they were 
limited in what they could consider as good neighbor policies because they are 
considered a protected class of tenants.  The policies could not be construed as 
discriminatory.  The staffing, the security system, and the alarm system are not 
typical conditions of approval and the Board crossed them out of the findings 
and adopted the findings 5 to 0.
1450 Franklin Street,a project 
similar to 365 Fulton Street.  It is also in an expired Redevelopment Agency 
project area.  The appellant, San Francisco Architectural Heritage, requested a 
continuance to review the findings.  The project sponsor consented and the item 
was continued to April 15th.
A deck installed without permit on Cayuga Street âit was along the side property line and had a massive fire wall 
that extended about 36 inches above the fence for the depth of the deck.  The 
Board heard the appellant and reviewed the revised plans submitted by the 
project sponsor.  The Board decided they didnât want any fire wall along the 
side property line.  The project sponsor now has to revise the deck that was 
built without permit.
Another appeal was on 17thAvenue that relates to a rooms-down permitâ this was the addition of bathrooms on the ground floor.  During the course of 
the appeal, it came to the Departmentâs attention that the project sponsor had 
mis-represented the existing conditions on the plan.  There was an existing 
interior connection to the ground floor.  This was never showing as existing on 
the plans and would have affected the Departmentâs review so we requested 
specific changes to the project and the Board took the bulk of the Departments 
recommendations and ordered those changes to the project.
An appeal at 170-172 Clara Street-- this project originated in 2007 when Eastern Neighborhoods was still going on 
and the controls had not been finalized.  This was a two-level industrial 
building.  They wanted to convert the second level to residential use and add a 
third level for residential use.  There were concerns about the displacement of 
the PDR use.  They divided the project into 2 phases.  The first would provide a 
stair penthouse and do some interior work but would not change the use to 
residential.  That permit was issued earlier this year prior to the initiation 
of Eastern Neighborhood controls and was appealed by neighbors who had concerns 
about the impacts of the stair penthouse on light and air to the adjacent 
property, which is the City Mews apartment complex.  The Board had concerns 
about the second phase of the project which is out for the 312 notification 
process right now.  If neighbors have concerns about that phase of the project 
that includes the change in use and the third floor residential, then it might 
come before you under Discretionary Review.  The Board continued this item to 
early June to allow time for the 312 notification process to complete and see if 
any DR requests are filed and to allow time for the project sponsor to change 
their plans and permits.
