4.Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Antonini:
There are a couple of articles of interest.One is in today's Examiner dealing with the deferral of fees.This is an issue I brought up and is being explored in other jurisdictions.The item from the press –More Jurisdictions in California slash housing impact fees.The quote is  when the housing recovery comes, it will be the cities with the lowest fees that will benefit first.I don't know if that is always true or not but it is certainly something that some people are stating.Another item from today's Chronicle and it talked about the town I was born in – Pleasanton.Pleasanton is being sued by the state over a limit on housing.This is an interesting situation.They passed legislation in 1996 that the door is closed at 29,000 housing units.They are up to 27,000 now and the population is about 66,000.They are pretty much maxed out.The justification was they wanted to spare farm land and open space in that area, of course they are probably a few decades late in doing that because much of it is built out already.And the other bad part about it is that there are business there so those who work there are increasingly forced to commute from someplace else.It will be interesting to see what the outcome will be in view of ABAG suggestions that various cities and counties have as far as housing units and how this is decided in the courts.
Commissioner Miguel:
The June 14thSunday issue of the New York Time's Magazine had articles devoted to infrastructure.There are at least two and probably three very interesting articles of more national import in that regard.They are well worth reading.In addition to that, the meeting I had this week was with people at 2655 Bush Street.
5.Director's Announcements
Director Rahaim:
I believe you should have in your packet today a draft of the India Basin Report.This is the first complete draft of that Plan that is being issued.This is collaboration between the Redevelopment Agency and the Planning Department.This is a draft that will be distributed for public comment over the next few months.We will be having a community workshop this evening at the Bayview Opera House to release this draft to the community and receive initial comments on this.This is a planning process that builds on the 2002 Bayview Hunters Point concept plan that was prepared by the Bayview PAC.It includes a wide variety of new mixed use development including new access to the water.The next steps are:there is a formal 60-day comment period and we will have office hours in the Bayview to receive comments from the public; and we will probably be coming to the Commission later in July or early August for preparation of amendments to the Bayview Hunters Point Redevelopment Plan.Then we will probably have a more formal hearing on this Plan after we assemble public comment in the fall.The thought being that it would be good for you to hear not only staff's proposed draft plan, but what the community is saying about that Plan in the next few months.So we will plan to do that in August or more likely in September.The second thing to call to your attention is the budget memo that I think is in your packets that will be sent out to you today as well.The Budget Committee did approve the Department's budget yesterday with the provision that the $500,000 in question that was added to the budget for the Department to work on additional long-range planning efforts was put on reserve with the Budget Committee.What that means is that we will continue to work with the Board Budget Committee on the specific uses for that money.In a nutshell, our budget as submitted in February totaled $20.8 million, which is a reduction of 12% from this year's budget.The projections for our budget for the year were done in February and presumed a little more revenue than is coming in.The Department's revenue cycles are interesting because we typically get  bumps  in fee activity and applications in the spring and the fall.Our projections made in February were assuming that we would get a spring bump, which essentially didn't happen.So our projections are a little higher than what we actually have coming in for 2009.We have revised our fee estimates and are continuing to work on what happens if that doesn't increase for the coming year.We are assuming that our applications will not decrease below this year, but we'll need tor recognize that the revenues are a little bit less as of now than we had projected going into the budget season.The other item that was approved in our budget and in DBI's budget was the funding for the permit tracking system.We are very pleased about that.We are in the early stages of negotiations with the preferred vendor on that.It will be very important for the long-term work of both departments.Later on today there is an item on your agenda related to some minor additional fees that we're proposing, but those will be covered at the 5:00 agenda time.

Un-named Speaker
Re: [permit number 200811045823 (2650-52 Hyde Street)] Why does staff of planning get allowed to lie before the Boards and Commissions and there is no consequences to them.The Board believes them even when we prove that they are lying.They still support them and we (the public) always get shut down.They are public servants. They are there to serve us and not to fight us and to discredit us, but that is what they keep doing.Please give us some help to stop this corruption that is going on in the city.

Re: 2650-52 Hyde Street – continuing the tail end of the first un-named speaker's comments on this case.We work very hard to prove our case and it makes us very aggravated when truth and justice is forced to take a back seat to lies and dishonesty.With respect to 2650-52 Hyde Street, the Building and Planning Department staff has pushed this project through with lies and deception to the public and to the Board of Appeals and they will do the same to you if given the chance.They are circumventing many of the code requirements for this project.They are creating a full basement and converting to a garage from a crawl space with a brick foundation.They are replacing this foundation by removing 4,000 cubic feet of soil and replacing the foundation with an eight foot high retaining wall.This is clearly not a $7,000 project.This is a $400,000 construction job.This does not serve the public.Please ask planner Perdue and the Planning Department to enforce the code and collect the required fees for the city and the tax payers.Please have planner Perdue insist on including a third sheet of plans so that the public can be served.

Re: I formally request reconsideration of your action on June 18 of five (5) commissioners to move forward the Discretionary Review Reform Policy and Planning Code Text Amendments with recommendation.Very important materials were not made available to allow a look at a most relevant and critical question, that being in how many instances did the Commission take DR when the Department recommended approve as proposed.Minutes of 22 meetings are not available for review. 16 meetings in '08 have no minutes available and 6 in '09 are not available for a good comprehensive overview.I went to Planning Department the week of June 18 hearing and on a Wednesday and I waited several hours for the binders of the agendas and the minutes.They weren't made available to me.This Tuesday and Wednesday, I reviewed same and I saw that looking at those there are very important facts.On April 2ndand also at the May hearing, I reported that it was clear from the minutes that were available that about one out of four cases the Commission took DR when the Department said approve as proposed.The district for the June 18thhearing developed what they called the  tracking spread sheet,  but that only looked at six (6) DR cases as opposed to the full (number) of DR that could have been looked at.When I look at the agendas that didn't have minutes available, it was clear that in those 22 meetings, there were 56 DRs that were showing on the agendas and 34 of those DRs were either mandatory discretionary review or staff initiated or had a recommendation saying take DR with modification.
