ABSENT:Borden, Miguel and Moore
14.Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Sugaya:
He received a letter from the National Trust for Historic Preservation regarding Japantown Better Neighborhoods Plan.In paragraph two or three there was a statement made about what kind of action the Commission could or couldn't take with respect to the CEQA language which says we are not supposed to be adopting plans or whatever it is, or even indicating support prior to the EIR being done.I forwarded that to the City Attorney's office to get some clarification.Maybe staff could follow up.
Director Rahaim responded:
I saw that email and we are happy to get more clarification on that.
Commissioner Sugaya:
I just don't want to be in violation.
Commissioner Olague:
I would like to understand a little bit better the laws govern disability and access.It comes up here occasionally and I just feel that I could use a briefing and more information on those laws.
Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:
For clarification, I want to understand whether you are interested in understanding ADA as it relates to Building Code and when you have to do an elevator and when you have to this and that.
Commissioner Olague:
All of it.Sometimes you see a project and &It is something I want to be more sensitive to.Reasonable accommodations and ADA -- Maybe it's a briefing on both for me; maybe from the Mayor's Office of Disability.It could be at the Department if no other commissioners are interested.
15.Director's Announcements
Director Rahaim:
I think Tara Sullivan sent you an email today that related to Articles 10 and 1.It had two things in it.One is a chart that compares the recommendations of the Historic Preservation Commission to those of the Planning Commission on the seven or eight key issues that you all discussed.It also has the maps that Tara and staff have prepared to look at the areas that are affected by Articles 10 and 11.
Zoning Administrator Badiner:
I granted a four month extension on a conditional use for 140 Ellis/317 Leavenworth.This project required a permit to convert a residential hotel.They only got the permit to convert issued by DBI about three months before the three years would have expired under the CU.I granted an additional four months to go through the process.I thought it was reasonable because they were pursuing the permit diligently through a city process.
