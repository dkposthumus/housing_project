Commissioner Moore:
On a very positive note, I would like to share with the Commission that I walked byBroderick Street yesterday, Drew, and look at the most stunning example of a vertical garden. Patrick Blanc, you remember a few years ago, not everybody was on the Commission at that time. We approved it with actually not having any precedent in San Francisco and it turned out to be just absolutely beautiful. You should go by there. It is the example of how to do it, if you have the right landscape architect and the right nurseries to provide the type of plants which thrive. It looks fantastic. On another note, my concerns about Chase signage continue. I walked by a very stunning example at the corner of Sutter and Montgomery where I am sure all of us walk, to count 22 Chase signs on the Montgomery and Sutter Street facade.  It's a former location of Charles Schwab which was a very kind of discreetly signed, but highly visibly brokerage firm at the corner, happened to be a San Francisco firm, and with Chase now moving in there are 22 signs, 11 on the outside of the façade, where in every column spacing there is one sign.  So, as the arcade goes on you have a sign per column spacing and then on the inside between lit signage on the storefront you have the blue ATM's and everything else which comes with it. I would like the Department to put that on the list of things to observe. It is very much not what I think we want or what our Code really prescribes. Lastly this morning I read of a wonderful story. We talked about 150 Otis Street the other day, Veteran’s Common. Apparently the 2540 Mission Street building which is the Medjool building with the roof top garden bar was just adapted to accept about 20 -- I'm not quite sure I’m right about the number, vouchers of veteran’s homes units negotiated by former Supervisor Dufty and I think that is a wonderful and positive thing to share with each other. It’s described in today’s paper if anyone wants more detail on that.
Commissioner Antonini:
I read with interest about the story regarding, I think it was the chairperson of Yahoo that ask that employees not work from home anymore and in the future begin having to go to their campus to work. And being in the line of work I am, it's pretty impossible for anyone to work from home so I really can't comment on -- unless they're equipped and want the patients go to their homes. I can't really comment on tech businesses,  however, but it seems to me that in a creative type of atmosphere you would want as much interaction as possible between employees face-to-face and you can multi-task  more and network and do a lot of things that aren't easy to do if you're all at different locations and the other thing I would suggest being a San Francisco resident, and having a business here, would be, as we know many of the employees at a lot of these companies are San Francisco residents and have to commute to the campuses and I think we see the results of these with the buses and other things going through the City, but it might be wise for some of these companies, and I think we're beginning to see more of it, to relocate many of their workforce to San Francisco or their whole operation and it seems to be working well for Salesforce, Yelp, Twitter, Zynga and other companies that are here in San Francisco, and they're starting to find out you don't need the campus. You can have people in properly built vertical environments and still be just as productive as you are in a campus. It is kind of a disadvantage because there is no public transportation. Everyone is sort of locked in there more or less figuratively during the course of the day and probably it’s not as good as it could be, but that is my personal opinion. I'm not making a decision for any of these firms, but makes sense wasting an hour each way a day for everybody to commute to the campus from San Francisco or not everyone, but a significant part of your workforce could be better spent in more productive ways.
D.         DIRECTOR’S REPORT
10.        Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Good afternoon Commissioners the one announcement I have for today, is the Supplemental Budget request we had before you a couple of weeks ago, will be in front of the Budget and Finance Committee next Wednesday at 11:00 A.M.. We will be presenting similar presentations to what we gave you. We have been working with the Board’s Budget Analyst on the details of that and hope to have final agreement before then, but we will try to move forward as quickly as possible after that hearing to get the full Board approval, so that we can move forward and hire those eight positions that we proposed in that Supplemental.
11.        Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
LAND USE COMMITTEE:
At LU Committee, there was approximately 1.5 hrs of public comment. During the hearing Sups Wiener and Chiu were concerned about the "tradeoff" of less impact fees (especially the portion that goes towards transit) for higher affordability rates in "Major Residential Developments[1]", 2) Sup Wiener concerned about grandfathering the residential project on 11th Street due to its potential impacts on surrounding entertainment venues, 3) All of the Committee Supervisors were unclear about the impacts of grandfathering the AAU site as related to the current discussions for a potential development agreement between AAU and the City.
Regarding this last item, the Committee added a grandfathering provision for AAU’s 601 Brannan Street site, while asking for more info from staff which may result in the removal of this provision next week. The impact fee discussion resulted in a new amendment from Supervisor Wiener  to change the impact fee and affordable housing mechanism for “Major Developments.” Projects here would now pay full Tier 2 residential impact fees, and provide Tier A affordability instead of paying the higher affordable housing fees proposed in Tier B. This would provide for increased affordability in these projects (but not at levels as high as proposed by the Commission).  This change would also ensure no loss of impact fees. These amendments are still up in the air as the Committee stated that they may rescind some of the provisions after hearing from our Department on the following items:
1.A capacity and development projection analysis for the “Major Development” sites within WSoMa (Wiener and Chiu).
2.Information on how this impact fee/affordable housing mechanism have worked so far in UMU (Chiu).
3.How the grandfathering issue will or will not impact the larger negotiations with AAU regarding an overall development agreement (All).
The Committee expressed a desire to move this item out of Committee next week if possible.
·Central Subway Extraction Site SUD.This ordinance would allow the demolition of the Pagoda theater so that the Central Subway Boring Machine could be removed from underground and it would allow the rebuild of the building with a project previously approved by the Commission. You approved this ordinance and the associated CU authorization on 2/14/13. At LU Committee, there was about 30m of public comment. The public discussed issues such as preparation of EIR addendum versus Supplemental EIR; costs and disruption of removal of boring machine versus leaving it underground; adequacy of measures for dewatering of the site during construction and other construction-related impacts; and assurances that the newly constructed project would not exceed the height of the existing building. President Chiu asked SFMTA staff to clarify the technical/engineering issues, and asked Planning staff to confirm that the newly constructed project would not exceed the height of the existing building.  As you’ll remember, both the CU conditions and the SUD require preparation of a detailed roof height survey of the existing building, and specify that the new building may not exceed the height of the roof profile of the existing building at any point).With that the Committee recommended approval. The item was sent to the Board for Tuesday’s hearing where it was unanimously approved.
FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
INTRODUCTIONS: We have a host of new introductions.
·130184 60 Day Extension for the 1111 8thStreet SUD Art & Design[BF 111278]
·130174 60 Day Extension for AvalosConversion, Merger Demo Ord [BF 130041]
·130182 Police Code Amendmentfrom Supervisor Wiener that would to clarify permit requirements and procedures, as well as to expand suspension, citation, and enforcement provisions regarding Entertainment Commission and Place of Entertainment permits, including changes to the Limited Live Performance Permit such as allowing DJs and expanding this permit to include outdoor spaces; amending the Administrative Code to clarify fee setting and reporting procedures.  As this item is a Police Code amendment, it will not be brought before this commission, unless the Commission or President requests a hearing on this item.
·130180 Pre-Application Meetings in Product/Distribution/Repair-1-B Districts.This ordinance introduced by Supervisor Cohen would amend the Planning Code to require pre-application meetings for certain projects in the this district.  This item will be brought before this body within 90 days.
BOARD OF APPEALS:
Board of Appeals did not meet last night, but there were actually two items that I wanted to report from last week’s hearing. The first being 2065 Oakdale Avenue, I had mentioned this to the Commission in January. The Board of Appeals upheld the permit as a PDR-1B property and they sought to reduce the size of the building, but there were concerns from the neighbors about how they were doing the work and that they weren’t doing proper mitigations to the site for air quality issues, so there is an appeal from the neighborhood on that. The Board upheld the permit, but they did have a condition to do a soil study. There was a rehearing request on the permit and in the rehearing request the appellant noted some facts where only a day over two after the Board of Appeals hearing the Project Sponsor continued work, removed paint, that was probably lead paint without proper containment and also was doing additional demolition within the building. A Building Inspector was called out, they tried to make entry to the premises, they were barred from entry and they were intimidated, so the Police Department was called, and responded to the scene.  An additional Notice of Violation was issued this was all reported to the Board of Appeals last week.  The Board of Appeals felt there were significant issues with this permit and they voted unanimously to allow the rehearing request, which has been scheduled for April 10th. One other item was at 26thand Taraval it was a building permit for a tenant improvement, it was actually a change of use that was not routed to Planning. It was going from a personal service use to a business and professional service use. There was an appeal on the building permit as well as related mechanical and plumbing and electrical permits. As a result, each side had 28 minutes to present their case; because you are given 7 minutes for each of appeal you have, so it was quite a lengthy hearing that evening. One of the issues, this was in the new Taraval NCD that the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors had adopted, and at the time it was before you we made a recommendation regarding the use categories because if you look at business and professional service use in the table it says principally permitted, but if you look at the Street Frontage Controls it's not considered active commercial ground for use, so it's not allowed in the Neighborhood Commercial District, only with a conditional use authorization. We had wanted to use more explicit… It was the recommendation of the Department, of this Commission, however the Board of Supervisors did not accept that change so the table does have this…It can be quite confusing where it looks as if it’s principally permitted, but in reality it is a conditional use authorization, so this was pointed out to the parties last week. When we became aware of this we requested that the Board of Appeals actually deny the permit because it needed the conditional use authorization if they were to relocate there. The Board continued the item to allow them to provide additional information item because now they're arguing they're a financial service use given how they operate. They're an insurance company, but they said they also offer financial services. So the Board continued that for more information and that's all I have to report.
