11.Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
No Report
BOARD OF APPEALS:
The Board of Appeals met yesterday there were several items that they might of interest to the Commission,and I'd like to brief details of those. The first was a jurisdiction request for a letter of legitimation for 435-437 Potrero Avenue, you heard this item as a conditional use authorization last month, and in this case, the jurisdiction requesters were claiming they didn't have timely notice of the letter of legitimation the Board unanimously denied that request. I will note that the CU authorization and the environmental review have been appealed to the Board of Supervisors, we waiting to hear from the City Attorney’s Office and the Department of Public Works, whether or not they were valid appeals, the second itemwas anotherjurisdiction request for a letter of determination that I issuedfor the property at 3166 16th Street this isregards to Jack Spade, which was seeking to locate at this location, this was issued on September of last year,found thatthey were not inform of the retail issue, I would notethat there is not notification requirement for letters of determination, however, as a matter of policy I have been sending them to neighborhood groups in the vicinity, this was mailed to 36 neighborhoodgroups in our Department mailing list,and there were no appeals filed at that time, and this was a jurisdiction request, for an organization to reopen the 15 day appeal period, there are variety of concerns about whether or notthis use was actually a formula retail and note that are appeals of two buildings permit related to the use that the Board is calendar for next -– appearing next week, so at this hearing I'll advise the Board that they do have full discussion on those permits, they could make a determinationthat the permits were improperly issues, because they believed that is formula retail and so they full discussion on that, they didn't take jurisdiction or granted jurisdiction request on this case and they will hear the matter fully next week on the two building permit applications that on appeals for the Jack Spades Store. Another item was a re- hearing request for 70 Crestline Drive. This is the project that the Department has recommend disapproval of the Planning Commission approved under DR, at the hearing the Board of Appeals denied the permit, overturning the Planning Commissions decision. There was recent information that was brought to our attention, yesterday we received aletter from the County Surveyor who stated, that the subdivision requestwhich they're reviewing it and they received it in July, was when the subdivision was actually submitted after this Commission have taken its action on the building permit, they reviewed the subdivision and found that the 1962 subdivision established building setback lines, that would prohibited construction in the area on the lot that is to be subdivided,so this is actually new information, we did not have time at the hearing. The Board continued the re-hearing request to the call of the Chair and is going to see what happened with this subdivision application.Because it is my understanding that the subdivision approved with thisconditions could be appealed to the Board of Supervisors, and the Board of Supervisors may have the final word, whether or not there are any conditions that would prohibit some construction on this area of the lot and depending on that, the matter might be brought back to the Board of Appeals for their consideration, so, this is kind of last minute news, that we heard yesterday but we'll keep you updated on that. The final items was a variance for 225 Clipper StreetI denied a variance for front setback the proposal was to establish a parking pad in front of the building and they would allow the parkingthat would be on screen from view so in the variance for the setback and also variance from now having parking on screen from view,I denied the variance because it would result of the removal one on-street-offspace on such privatization of the parking space, and also, because the parking pad that was going to be createdwas not very substandard, was only 10’ feet deep, I would note that 2013 Toyota Prius depth is about 14-/12 feet so most carthat would park in that area, unless it's something like a smart car would overhang into the public right away, so then I deniedthis variance request and the Board of Appeals unanimously upheldmy denial. They're meeting again next week and I'll report on that and the Jack Spade item when the Commission reconvenes.
