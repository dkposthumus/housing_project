Commissioner Moore:
I just wanted to report on the ribbon cutting yesterday of the Veterans Commons. A remarkable event. Not just only because of who was in attendance, but also because of the incredible number of people who supported, helped and made this project possible. It’s a lovely adaptive re-use, with a strong historic preservation element. A strong second tax advantage with historic preservation credits, which were, I think, never used before in a manner that were brought forward here. Commissioner Sugaya is the expert on that. It was a great, really joyous moment, to see this project come together as quickly as it did. So, if many people think “can’t do” in San Francisco, “nothing works,” “nothing can be delivered,” it is definitely proof, that an extremely complicated project, if you get to list who indeed helped bring it about, from the Federal Government, Veterans Administration, on and on and on.  I think we can all be very proud of this project.
Commissioner Antonini:
I know that there is legislation that’s being introduced by Supervisor Farrell regarding condominium conversions. As you know, there are many people who are already in tenants-in-common situations, often grouped with people they may not be really close to, and they are co-owners. Until such time as a separation is made. These ownership units becoming individualized. I think this has a lot of promise. My question is, is this going to come before us for some sort of discussion in the future?
Director Rahaim:
Commissioner, I believe that legislation was already introduced, and there has already been one hearing on it, I do not know the schedule at this point, the hearing was continued, and I don’t have the dates. AnMarie is not in today, she had a death in the family. So, I could check with the other legislative staff about that, I do not know the date of the continuance, we can check with the Supervisor’s office on the schedule and we could figure out if there’s a time…
Commissioner Antonini:
It would be nice if there is time when we can have a discussion just to entertain public comment and also the input from other Commissioners on this issue which I think is an important one.
Commissioner Borden:
I happened to come by two interesting events yesterday. One of which was, SF Honda, at the corner of Van Ness and Market, had a reopening event.  It is a family that has had this facility for more than 40 years and they completely remodeled the facility to modernize it.  Honda is making a great investment in them being an anchor and staying in the neighborhood.  It’s just very nice to see people from the Civic Center Community Benefits District, Bayview Merchants and different merchants from around the City really working with this small business that had a lot of support from small businesses in the immediate community and all throughout the City. And the family is very much lauded for being a part of the community and even one of the local restaurants had provided the food and wine for the event. So, it was just great to see that a family owned business that has been around for such long time is surviving and reinvesting back into the community.  Second, I went to an event for Booker T. Washington Community Center, as many of you all know, they need $34 million dollars to complete their project, currently at $33 million dollars they are in the process of trying to raise the final million dollars, to make their project happen. They really need to make that happen sooner, rather than later, because construction costs are starting to go up, and if they don’t break ground soon, they will be in a situation that will be more costly to build that project.  Just to remind everybody that this project is a community center with a combination of 40 units for emancipated foster youth and other youth that are in the system.  It is a great project. I hope that they are successful, because they actually still have legal battles that they are dealing with in the courts as well.
Commissioner Sugaya:
Following up on Commissioner Moore’s comment on Veterans Commons, for those of you who do not know the address is 150 Otis Street, which is kind of in the back of where the Planning Department is located on Mission Street Just to take a second to elaborate, it did use a combination of Federal tax credits, both low income tax credits and also historic preservation tax credits, which Commissioner Moore mentioned. The historic preservation tax credits are worth as tax credits not a deduction as a straight credit 20% of the rehabilitation costs of the project, so it’s a substantial amount coming back to the, well, I can’t say the developer, because they are non-profit organizations. In the case where they are non-profits, it can be syndicated, and I think in this case it’s maybe Bank of America.  Wells provided some other financing, but I think BofA is taking the tax credit. So is a really good project, HPC did review the project and gave it its blessing and the Mayor’s Office of Housing was of course involved, all around I think it was an excellent project and a good example, not only for historic preservation, but for affordable housing in the City.
Commissioner Moore:
Could I chime in Commissioner Sugaya. I had the ability to communicate the portion about the historic preservation tax credits to Speaker of the House Pelosi, who didn’t know anything about it. I was actually 3 or 4 back in line, and had the opportunity to remind her of how important this was, because she was unaware that you combine the two things. So, we hope that this will help us perhaps with other like projects in San Francisco.
Commissioner Wu:
So it’s great to see this project get so much attention. I think that it’s really an opportunity to think for surplus land for the City.  I believe the advocacy around surplus land is where the conversation first started. I also wanted to mention that I had the pleasure of introducing Director Rahaim at a SPUR forum, that he somewhat controversially titled, last week, and it’s really a missed opportunity at the Commission, that we don’t really talk about long term vision, as much as we could. Director Rahaim, laid out six directions that he thinks we need to go in the next three to five years. I think I would love to either see it here at Commission or somewhere more public sort of, maybe hosted by the Planning Department or within the Department, but really a public forum for us to talk about short and long-term vision for this Department rather than being focused every week on our agenda.
Commissioner Fong:
I will have to agree with that, I do not know what the forum is, when we bring it into play, but I’d love to see the notes if you had a package doc that went along with those, Commissioners might have interest and that might spread the idea of bringing it before us as a larger body.
Commissioner Sugaya:
Yes, two things, along that line, there was a piece in the paper about other Commissions and Boards  holding annual retreats. I think at the beginning of the year. I know there is a noticing issue, but sometimes I think the public realizes they don’t have to show up all the time.  Anyway, it might be an idea to take in consideration and I think it was, I forget the Commission who do they meet here, but they held their retreat, they were in the City, I think it was Southwest Community Center. Just back on Veteran’s Commons, Swords to Plowshares is the sponsoring organization and they were assisted in the development by Chinatown CDC.
Commissioner Fong:
I wanted to add one thing and maybe, I apologize if it’s in your Director’s report, but yesterday, was the kick-off meeting for the Citizen’s Advisory Group for the permit tracking system and some people in the audience were there yesterday, as well, offering very sound comments in my opinion. It’s moving along quite well. Yesterday, was the first of a couple of different meetings and there will be some testing and training that goes along in the spring and into the fall, but I think it’s a worthy project and in the short and long term, the Department and public will benefit from it.
5.         Review and Approval of Combined Commission Secretary Position Announcement and Recruitment Process - Commissioner Antonini will present this item.
SPEAKERS:    None
6.         Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
I did also want to mention the Citizen's Advisory Committee for the permit tracking system, I appreciate President Fong's involvement and Commissioner Hasz from the Historic Preservation Commission is also on that Committee. I'm thrilled to say we're on target, on schedule on that project for a fall roll out so I'm very happy about that. I also wanted to give the Commission a very brief update on the Academy of Art and the notices of violation you probably saw the article in the paper today. They did meet the requested items to meet their January 24th deadline on those conditions of the violations from last week and today they are 99% of the way there.  They have agreed to the scopes of the environmental review, the last two pieces of the scope of the environmental review which is the deadline for today and we're working out some final details on that.  I'm optimistic that will happen by the end of the day or first thing in the morning. So far, they are meeting their required deadlines as the conditions of those notices of violation. There is no Board of Supervisor's report today I don't believe and no Board of Appeals either, they did not meet this week.
