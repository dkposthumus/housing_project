Planning Code (Zoning Ordinance) by amending Section 306 to require the
Director of Planning to provide to any person who has requested in writing,
notice of actions to be taken pursuant to the Planning Code or State law. 
Currently, various sections of the Planning Code require a newspaper notice of
public hearings before the Planning Commission or the Zoning Administrator for
various actions to be taken by these bodies.  In cases where the action would
affect a particular site or area, a mailed notice is required to be sent to owners
of the subject site or area and of surrounding properties.  Though not a legal
requirement, notices regarding matters that are not site specific are also sent to
parties known to be interested in the issue.  This amendment would also require
that a notice be sent to any person who has submitted a written request to be
notified and would prohibit the Department from charging a fee to cover its
expenses for postage and maintaining the notification records. Testimony and
Commission considerations could result in recommendations of modifications to
the proposed legislation.SPEAKERS: Patricia Vaughey, Sue Hestor, June Gutflash, Judy WestACTION: Disapproved as amendedAYES: Chinchilla, Theoharis, Hills, Joe, MillsNOES: Antenore, MartinMOTION No.: 1469112.	98.595U		(ANDRADE)26-7TH STREET - APPEAL OF DIRECTOR'S DECISION (PER SECTION

Impact Report (FSEIR).   The project is the proposed adoption of two Redevelopment Plans and
establishment of two Redevelopment Areas (Mission Bay North and Mission Bay South) and
associated documents and actions to develop an urban mixed-use community consisting of
residential, commercial, light industrial, educational (a major new University of California San
Francisco site), and open space uses, with supporting infrastructure (including new streets and
sewers), community facilities, and other public improvements.  The proposed project would be
located on approximately 303 acres located generally south of Townsend Street, east of
Seventh Street and I-280 freeway, and north of Mariposa Street.Note: the Public Hearing for this Item Is Closed; the Public Comment Period for the Draft Seir
Ended on June 9, 1998.The Administrative Record for this SEIR is contained in Case File No. 96.771E, available for
public review at the Planning Department, 1660 Mission Street, San Francisco.Copies of the Draft SEIR and the Summary of Comments and Responses are available at the 
Planning Department, 1660 Mission Street, first floor Planning Information Counter, and the San
Francisco Redevelopment Agency, 770 Golden Gate Avenue, 3rd floor reception, both open
weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Copies are available for review at the San Francisco Main
Library (Civic Center) and Potrero branch libraries.  The SEIR has been prepared as a "stand

impacts without the need for frequent reference to the previous 1990 Mission Bay EIR, which
was prepared for a different proposal.  The 1990 Mission Bay EIR is available for review at the
Planning Department, 5th floor reception, and at the San Francisco Main Library.SPEAKER(S):Jim Morales, Kofi Bonner, David Prowler, Amy Neches, Susana Montana,

Planning Code (Zoning Ordinance) by amending Section 155.1 to clarify definition of and
obligations of the responsible City official and the landlord regarding the provision of bicycle
facilities in or for building space leased to the City and deleting obsolete implementation
schedule provisions.  The amendment would add Section 155.2 to require bicycle parking in
privately-owned and City-owned parking garages, and would add Section 155.3 to require
shower and locker facilities be provided in or for new buildings and buildings undergoing major
expansion.  Planning Code Section 155(j) already requires bicycle spaces in required accessory
auto parking facilities.  There is no auto parking requirement for uses other than residential use
in the C-3 (Downtown Commercial) Districts, so no bicycle parking is required or would be

Director of Planning to provide to any person who has requested in writing,
notice of actions to be taken pursuant to the Planning Code or State law. 
Currently, various sections of the Planning Code require a newspaper notice of
public hearings before the Planning Commission or the Zoning Administrator for
various actions to be taken by these bodies.  In cases where the action would
affect a particular site or area, a mailed notice is required to be sent to owners
of the subject site or area and of surrounding properties.  Though not a legal
requirement, notices regarding matters that are not site specific are also sent to
parties known to be interested in the issue.  This amendment would also require
that a notice be sent to any person who has submitted a written request to be
notified and would prohibit the Department from charging a fee to cover its
expenses for postage and maintaining the notification records. Testimony and
Commission considerations could result in recommendations of modifications to
the proposed legislation.SPEAKERS: Patricia Vaughey, Sue Hestor, June Gutflash, Judy WestACTION: Disapproved as amendedAYES: Chinchilla, Theoharis, Hills, Joe, MillsNOES: Antenore, MartinMOTION No.: 1469112.	98.595U		(ANDRADE)26-7TH STREET - APPEAL OF DIRECTOR'S DECISION (PER SECTION

obligations of the responsible City official and the landlord regarding the provision of bicycle
facilities in or for building space leased to the City and deleting obsolete implementation
schedule provisions.  The amendment would add Section 155.2 to require bicycle parking in
privately-owned and City-owned parking garages, and would add Section 155.3 to require
shower and locker facilities be provided in or for new buildings and buildings undergoing major
expansion.  Planning Code Section 155(j) already requires bicycle spaces in required accessory
auto parking facilities.  There is no auto parking requirement for uses other than residential use

respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the
item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been
reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the
Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be
exercised during the Public Comment portion of the calendar.  Each member of the public may
address the Commission for up to three minutes.  If it is demonstrated that comments by the
public will exceed 15 minutes, the President or chairperson may continue Public Comment to
another time during the meeting.
"The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on

PUBLIC NOTICE AMENDMENT - Consideration of a proposal to amend the
Planning Code (Zoning Ordinance) by amending Section 306 to require the
Director of Planning to provide to any person who has requested in writing,
notice of actions to be taken pursuant to the Planning Code or State law. 
Currently, various sections of the Planning Code require a newspaper notice of
public hearings before the Planning Commission or the Zoning Administrator for
various actions to be taken by these bodies.  In cases where the action would
affect a particular site or area, a mailed notice is required to be sent to owners
of the subject site or area and of surrounding properties.  Though not a legal
requirement, notices regarding matters that are not site specific are also sent to
parties known to be interested in the issue.  This amendment would also require
that a notice be sent to any person who has submitted a written request to be
notified and would prohibit the Department from charging a fee to cover its
expenses for postage and maintaining the notification records. Testimony and
Commission considerations could result in recommendations of modifications to
the proposed legislation.

Impact Report (FSEIR).   The project is the proposed adoption of two Redevelopment Plans and
establishment of two Redevelopment Areas (Mission Bay North and Mission Bay South) and
associated documents and actions to develop an urban mixed-use community consisting of
residential, commercial, light industrial, educational (a major new University of California San
Francisco site), and open space uses, with supporting infrastructure (including new streets and
sewers), community facilities, and other public improvements.  The proposed project would be
located on approximately 303 acres located generally south of Townsend Street, east of
Seventh Street and I-280 freeway, and north of Mariposa Street.Note: the Public Hearing for this Item Is Closed; the Public Comment Period for the Draft Seir
Ended on June 9, 1998.The Administrative Record for this SEIR is contained in Case File No. 96.771E, available for
public review at the Planning Department, 1660 Mission Street, San Francisco.Copies of the Draft SEIR and the Summary of Comments and Responses are available at the 
Planning Department, 1660 Mission Street, first floor Planning Information Counter, and the San
Francisco Redevelopment Agency, 770 Golden Gate Avenue, 3rd floor reception, both open
weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Copies are available for review at the San Francisco Main
Library (Civic Center) and Potrero branch libraries.  The SEIR has been prepared as a "stand
alone" document sufficient to provide a clear understanding of the project and its potential
impacts without the need for frequent reference to the previous 1990 Mission Bay EIR, which
was prepared for a different proposal.  The 1990 Mission Bay EIR is available for review at the
Planning Department, 5th floor reception, and at the San Francisco Main Library.SPEAKER(S):Jim Morales, Kofi Bonner, David Prowler, Amy Neches, Susana Montana,

obligations of the responsible City official and the landlord regarding the provision of bicycle
facilities in or for building space leased to the City and deleting obsolete implementation
schedule provisions.  The amendment would add Section 155.2 to require bicycle parking in
privately-owned and City-owned parking garages, and would add Section 155.3 to require
shower and locker facilities be provided in or for new buildings and buildings undergoing major
expansion.  Planning Code Section 155(j) already requires bicycle spaces in required accessory
auto parking facilities.  There is no auto parking requirement for uses other than residential use
in the C-3 (Downtown Commercial) Districts, so no bicycle parking is required or would be

residential, commercial, light industrial, educational (a major new University of California San
Francisco site), and open space uses, with supporting infrastructure (including new streets and

obligations of the responsible City official and the landlord regarding the provision of bicycle
facilities in or for building space leased to the City and deleting obsolete implementation
schedule provisions.  The amendment would add Section 155.2 to require bicycle parking in

shower and locker facilities be provided in or for new buildings and buildings undergoing major
expansion.  Planning Code Section 155(j) already requires bicycle spaces in required accessory
auto parking facilities.  There is no auto parking requirement for uses other than residential use

B.SPECIAL CALENDAR
1.	96.771E(DEUTSCH)
MISSION BAY REDEVELOPMENT PLANS,   Certification of Final Subsequent Environmental
Impact Report (FSEIR).   The project is the proposed adoption of two Redevelopment Plans and
establishment of two Redevelopment Areas (Mission Bay North and Mission Bay South) and
associated documents and actions to develop an urban mixed-use community consisting of
residential, commercial, light industrial, educational (a major new University of California San
Francisco site), and open space uses, with supporting infrastructure (including new streets and
sewers), community facilities, and other public improvements.  The proposed project would be
located on approximately 303 acres located generally south of Townsend Street, east of
Seventh Street and I-280 freeway, and north of Mariposa Street.
Note: the Public Hearing for this Item Is Closed; the Public Comment Period for the Draft Seir
Ended on June 9, 1998.
The Administrative Record for this SEIR is contained in Case File No. 96.771E, available for
public review at the Planning Department, 1660 Mission Street, San Francisco.
Copies of the Draft SEIR and the Summary of Comments and Responses are available at the 
Planning Department, 1660 Mission Street, first floor Planning Information Counter, and the San
Francisco Redevelopment Agency, 770 Golden Gate Avenue, 3rd floor reception, both open
weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Copies are available for review at the San Francisco Main
Library (Civic Center) and Potrero branch libraries.  The SEIR has been prepared as a "stand
alone" document sufficient to provide a clear understanding of the project and its potential
impacts without the need for frequent reference to the previous 1990 Mission Bay EIR, which
was prepared for a different proposal.  The 1990 Mission Bay EIR is available for review at the
Planning Department, 5th floor reception, and at the San Francisco Main Library.

Planning Code (Zoning Ordinance) by amending Section 155.1 to clarify definition of and
obligations of the responsible City official and the landlord regarding the provision of bicycle
facilities in or for building space leased to the City and deleting obsolete implementation
schedule provisions.  The amendment would add Section 155.2 to require bicycle parking in
privately-owned and City-owned parking garages, and would add Section 155.3 to require
shower and locker facilities be provided in or for new buildings and buildings undergoing major
expansion.  Planning Code Section 155(j) already requires bicycle spaces in required accessory
auto parking facilities.  There is no auto parking requirement for uses other than residential use
in the C-3 (Downtown Commercial) Districts, so no bicycle parking is required or would be

meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at
which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing,
your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the
calendar.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.  If it is
demonstrated that comments by the public will exceed 15 minutes, the President or chairperson may
continue Public Comment to another time during the meeting.

posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public comment, the
commission is limited to: (1) briefly responding to statements made or questions posed by members of
the public, or (2) requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting, or (3) directing staff
to place the item on a future agenda.  (Government Code Section 54954.2(a).)

RESOLUTION No.: 14706
14. 98.280ET	(ROSETTER)
BICYCLE TRANSIT ENHANCEMENT PLAN,Consideration of a proposal to amend the
Planning Code (Zoning Ordinance) by amending Section 155.1 to clarify definition of and
obligations of the responsible City official and the landlord regarding the provision of bicycle
facilities in or for building space leased to the City and deleting obsolete implementation
schedule provisions.  The amendment would add Section 155.2 to require bicycle parking in
privately-owned and City-owned parking garages, and would add Section 155.3 to require
shower and locker facilities be provided in or for new buildings and buildings undergoing major
expansion.  Planning Code Section 155(j) already requires bicycle spaces in required accessory
auto parking facilities.  There is no auto parking requirement for uses other than residential use
in the C-3 (Downtown Commercial) Districts, so no bicycle parking is required or would be
required by this amendment in downtown buildings except in residential buildings and buildings
primarily used as parking garages.
