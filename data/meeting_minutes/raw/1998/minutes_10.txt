    209.1 to legalize a fifth dwelling unit in an existing three-story, four-family dwelling
    in an RH-3 (Residential, House, Three-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk
    District.(Continued from Regular Meeting of March 26, 1998)Note:On 3/19/98, following testimony, the Commission closed public
    hearing and passed a motion of intent to disapprove by a vote +4 -2 with Commissioners Joe
    and Hills voting no and Commissioner Martin absent.SPEAKERS: NoneACTION: Disapproved project with modified motion:Second pagragraph of preamble should be corrected to read March 19978Revised 4th paragraph:The Commission has heard and considered testimony and written materials and
    oral testimony presented to it at the public hearing on behalf of the applicant,
    Department staff, and other interested parties.Findings:4. During the hearing before the CommissionThe Department has received
    conflicting testimony regarding the date that the unit in question was established.
    According to documents from the Department of Building Inspections, the unit was
    established prior to 1960. A previous tenant and a current tenant in the building have
    testified that the unit existed prior to the purchase of the building by the applicant.
    However,several tenants of the buildinghavetestified that the
    unit was established within the past two years. No evidence was submitted during the
    hearing to establish that the unit had existed prior to 1960.6.Although the Commission received some testimony from neighborhood
    residents that the additional unit would not be detrimentalStrong opposition to
    the unit was received from a number of occupants of the building and from several
    residents in the neighborhood.7. The project complies with all applicable provisions of the Planning
    Code.78.The Residence Element of the General Plan (Objective 3,
    Policy 3) encourages legalizing illegal dwelling units, but only when there is no
    neighborhood opposition.8. The evidence before Commission establishedbelievesthat
    the current owner established the unit in question without the benefit of a Building
    Permit.In order to avoid setting a precedent of encourage the construction of
    illegal units, the Commission feels an obligation to deny the Conditional Use
    Authorization.AYES: Chinchilla, Theoharis, Mills, AntenoreNOES: Hills, JoeABSENT: MartinMOTION No.: 146089. 97.645CV (IONIN)1301 GRANT AVENUE, northwest corner at Vallejo Street; Lot 8 in Assessor's Block

Revised 4th paragraph:
The Commission has heard and considered testimony and written materials and
    oral testimony presented to it at the public hearing on behalf of the applicant,
    Department staff, and other interested parties.
Findings:
4. During the hearing before the CommissionThe Department has received
    conflicting testimony regarding the date that the unit in question was established.
    According to documents from the Department of Building Inspections, the unit was
    established prior to 1960. A previous tenant and a current tenant in the building have
    testified that the unit existed prior to the purchase of the building by the applicant.
    However,several tenants of the buildinghavetestified that the
    unit was established within the past two years. No evidence was submitted during the
    hearing to establish that the unit had existed prior to 1960.
6.Although the Commission received some testimony from neighborhood
    residents that the additional unit would not be detrimentalStrong opposition to
    the unit was received from a number of occupants of the building and from several
    residents in the neighborhood.
7. The project complies with all applicable provisions of the Planning
    Code.
78.The Residence Element of the General Plan (Objective 3,
    Policy 3) encourages legalizing illegal dwelling units, but only when there is no
    neighborhood opposition.
8. The evidence before Commission establishedbelievesthat
    the current owner established the unit in question without the benefit of a Building
    Permit.In order to avoid setting a precedent of encourage the construction of
    illegal units, the Commission feels an obligation to deny the Conditional Use
    Authorization.
