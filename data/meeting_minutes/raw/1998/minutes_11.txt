Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report.The
proposed federal action discussed in the Draft EIS/EIR is the disposal of federal surplus
land at the former Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco, California. The document
also considers the impacts of the Reuse Plan, developed by the City and County of San
Francisco and the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency, as well as a Reduced Development
alternative and the required No Action alternative. The Proposed Reuse Plan would be
implemented by the Hunters Point Shipyard Redevelopment Plan (also called the
Redevelopment Plan), and emphasizes mixed use of the site, including residential,
industrial, maritime industrial, cultural, institutional, mixed use, research and
development, and open space uses. Implementation of the Proposed Reuse Plan may require
changes to the San Francisco General Plan (including the addition of a new Hunters Point
Shipyard Area Plan), and changes to Bay Conservation and Development Commission's Bay Plan
and to their Seaport Plan.(Continued from December 11, 1997)Note: Written comments will be received at the Planning Department until 5:00

Sections 227, 790.62 and 890.62 of the Planning Code (Zoning Ordinance) to include, in the
definition of "mortuary", casket stores and other retail establishments that
sell or offer for sale exclusively funerary goods. The effect of the proposal would be to
remove casket stores from the general retail store use category under the Planning Code
and subject it to the same Planning Code controls that apply to mortuaries. Generally,
this would reduce the number ofzoning districts where casket stores could be established, either as a permitted use or
as a conditional use, since mortuaries are allowed as a permitted or conditional use in
fewer zoning districts than are general retail stores.SPEAKERS: Judy West, Dick Millett, Bonnie GarveyACTION: ApprovedAYES: : Chinchilla, Theoharis, Mills, Hills, Joe, AntenoreABSENT: MartinMOTION No.: 1453719. 97.783C (ZWIERZYCKI)1129 LEAVENWORTH STREET, west side between Sacramento and California Streets,

DISPOSAL AND REUSE OF THE FORMER NAVAL SHIPYARD AT HUNTERS POINT--Public
Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report.The
proposed federal action discussed in the Draft EIS/EIR is the disposal of federal surplus
land at the former Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco, California. The document
also considers the impacts of the Reuse Plan, developed by the City and County of San
Francisco and the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency, as well as a Reduced Development
alternative and the required No Action alternative. The Proposed Reuse Plan would be
implemented by the Hunters Point Shipyard Redevelopment Plan (also called the
Redevelopment Plan), and emphasizes mixed use of the site, including residential,
industrial, maritime industrial, cultural, institutional, mixed use, research and
development, and open space uses. Implementation of the Proposed Reuse Plan may require
changes to the San Francisco General Plan (including the addition of a new Hunters Point
Shipyard Area Plan), and changes to Bay Conservation and Development Commission's Bay Plan
and to their Seaport Plan.

CASKET STORES DEFINITION AMENDMENT: Consideration of a proposal to amend
Sections 227, 790.62 and 890.62 of the Planning Code (Zoning Ordinance) to include, in the
definition of "mortuary", casket stores and other retail establishments that
sell or offer for sale exclusively funerary goods. The effect of the proposal would be to
remove casket stores from the general retail store use category under the Planning Code
and subject it to the same Planning Code controls that apply to mortuaries. Generally,
this would reduce the number of
zoning districts where casket stores could be established, either as a permitted use or
as a conditional use, since mortuaries are allowed as a permitted or conditional use in
fewer zoning districts than are general retail stores.
