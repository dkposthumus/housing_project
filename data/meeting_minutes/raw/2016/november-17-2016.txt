SPEAKERS:Paul Webber – Continued Indefinitely
We ask that the Art 7 be continued indefinitely. First, as of today, there is no available official rewrite of the proposal.Yet there are numerous changes suggested by one NCD, and probably by three others, none of which have appeared in any official version. With the Thanksgiving week in between now and December 1, it is impossible that a new version can published and adequately digested by you or the public in that period. Secondly, the outreach has been insufficient to inform the NCDs what is being proposed and how it affects them.They are comprised of small businesses whose owners have neither the time nor human resources to understand the impact of document.Yet they are being disadvantaged because the staff is NOT (but should be) performing the tasks that only a fortunate few NCDs have been able to do..

·Inquiries/Announcements.Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Richards:
Very briefly, there was an article in the New York times on Monday, about how some residents in Mountain View are coping with the housing shortage that are dual income households making quite a bit of money, yet the only thing they can afford is a trailer in a trailer park and the really interesting thing is, some of the trailers have Teslas in their carport. So, these wildly successful people are renting trailers in trailer parks and parking their Teslas there, really good article. Secondly, as a result of the election, rent control passed in Mountain View, Richmond, Oakland, but failed in Alameda, Burlingame and San Mateo. And then lastly, it is great that Airbnb will help to enforce the short term rental law. That is welcomed news for everyone in the City.
Commissioner Melgar:
I just had a request from a member of the public that I agree with, which is there is a lot of complicated information that comes to the Commission, that comes in different – at different times, so Academy of Art is an example, HOPE SF is another example, complicated, and I am wondering if part of what we do in terms of transparency, can be some type of indexing tool on the website, rather than it being attached to when it comes to the commission, just have it, you know, like those big projects having, you know, some kind of pagination. There are programs out there that allow you to easily search for things within a lot documents, so, anyway just a comment, an idea for when we do this stuff.
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary:
Just for clarity, are you referring to the individual documents or the subject matters being indexed?
Commissioner Melgar:
I think both, because a member the public might be interested just on the environmental review documents or a part of the Potrero Hill HOPE SF, but because it is part of a large discussion, you will have to go to different meetings to come up with the supportive documents rather that - there would have to be some judgment involved when grouping documents together, but seems like a reasonable request.
Commissioner Fong:
You're referring to the electronic versions?
Commissioner Melgar:
Uh-huh.
Commissioner Richards:
I think that's a really good point, because when I actually do that paper copies, I keep filing file the same subject in a file, even if there is just a link to the prior Commission packet that we heard, that would be helpful to keep a paper trail.
D.DEPARTMENT MATTERS
11.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Commissioners a couple of – kind of housekeeping items, you received a memo in your packet today related to Proposition 64 and the work that we will be doing, moving forward with the legalization of cannabis in California, and we will keep you informed and we talked briefly about that last week. In your packet for next week, you'll receive a fairly lengthy memo and supporting information related to the situation in Brisbane. We would ask that before, it gives you a fairly detail breakdown, what the Brisbane EIR actually studied the and 4 options that were studied as well as the proposal that the Planning Commission in Brisbane approved as well as what’s happening moving forward going ahead, so, that will be in your packet for next week and I will be happy to take some questions on that, as you look at that information. Thank you.
12.Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission
LAND USE COMMITTEE:
•160510 Planning Code - Student Housing Exemption from Inclusionary Housing Requirements. Sponsor: Wiener. Staff: Mohan/Starr
At this week’s land use committee hearing, the committee considered the proposed Ordinance, sponsored by Supervisor Wiener that amends the Planning Code to change the requirement from five to two years that Student Housing be owned or leased by an educational institution in order to be exempt from the Inclusionary Housing Program. The Planning Commission heard this item on September 8th of this year and voted unanimously to recommend approval. At the land use hearing, there were two speakers in support of the ordinance, and none in opposition. Supervisor Peskin had some questions about the need for lowering the time period from five to two years and how this is monitored and enforced. Those questions were answered by Andres Powers, who was representing the ordinance in Supervisor Wiener’s absence. The Committee then voted unanimously to recommend approval to the Full Board.
•161067 Planning Code, Zoning Map - Mission and 9th Street Special Use District. Sponsors: Kim; Peskin. Staff: Chang.This item was continued for one week because the General Plan Amendment associated with this project was not also calendared on this date, as is required.
FULL BOARD:
•160820 Planning Code - Landmark Designation - 1345 Ocean Avenue (aka Ingleside Presbyterian Church and the Great Cloud of Witnesses).Sponsor: Yee, Breed, Avalos. Staff: Ferguson. PASSED Second Read
•160821 Planning Code - Amending Landmark Designation - 140 Maiden Lane (aka V. C. Morris Gift Shop).Sponsor: Peskin. Staff: Ferguson. PASSED Second Read
•161024 Extending Interim Zoning Controls - New Ground Floor Office Uses Facing 2nd Street - King and Folsom Streets.Sponsor: Kim. Staff: Starr. Adopted
•161001 Hearing - Appeal of Determination of Exemption From Environmental Review - Proposed Project at 1515 South Van Ness Avenue.Staff: Kern/Gibson
Lastly at this week’s Board of Supervisor’s hearing, the Board sat as a committee of the whole to hear an appeal of the Environmental Determination for 1515 Van Ness. The project would demolish a vacant 34-foot-tall, 31,680-sq. ft. building, most recently occupied by McMillan Electric, in order to construct a five- to six-story mixed use building with 157 residential units, including 39 on-site BMR units (25%), 1,080 sq. ft. of retail, and 4,200 sq. ft. of trade shop space.
The appeal was based on claims that the Community Plan Exemption failed to adequately disclose impacts from gentrification, cumulative impacts from growth under the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan, and impacts on the Calle 24 Latino Cultural District. The appeal contends that the Eastern Neighborhoods EIR is out of date, and cannot be relied on to issue Community Plan Exemptions for subsequent projects.
Notable public comments from the project opponents were that the City is doing nothing to address gentrification of the Mission or the impacts on the Calle 24 Latino Cultural District.
Ultimately the Board voted to uphold the appeal with a 9-0 vote. The motion, made by Campos directed the department to provide an analysis of gentrification and displacement impacts and of the cumulative impacts of growth under the EN plan that accounts for all projects in the pipeline.
The Department is still considering the full impacts of this vote -- particularly what this means procedurally for this project- but we will conduct the additional analysis as directed by the Board.
INTRODUCTIONS:
•Board File TBD Interim Zoning Controls: Indoor Agriculture.Resolution creating interim controls to require CU approval for indoor Agricultural uses in PDR zoning districts for 18 months or until the adoption of permanent legislation.

SPEAKERS:Georgia Schutish – Mixing of ground water, rear yards, RDG’s and UDG’s, water absorption. RDGs should be worked on parallel to UDGs. There are many overlaps – not overcharging – but overlaps in issues. For example: Rear yards as natural areas are being compromised due to privacy fences which wall off yards from one another than the traditional fences have,butmost importantly water absorption into the ground because turf is installed and trees and other critical natural and habitat parts of our yards are being lost – because rear yards are becoming programmed spaces, plus the water is going to the sewer. Another issue is the over use of glass and the poor design quality due to bad fenestration which affects privacy and creates light pollution in the rear yards.
