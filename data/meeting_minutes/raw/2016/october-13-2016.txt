Commissioner Moore:
I wanted to thank the mayor for appointing Elaine Forbes as Director of the Port.Elaine has being an outstanding planner, moved to the Port quite a few years ago, and couldn’t be happier to see her take that role.
Commissioner Fong:
I concur with that, she is -- she'll be a great asset for the Port.
10.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Good afternoon Commissioners, I was also going to congratulate Elaine Forbes and note that she is a proud alumnae of the Planning Department, so I am very pleased to see her in that position. Secondly, Commissioners I just came from my annual meetings with my counterparts in the 30 largest cities in the country, which is a very fruitful series of discussions that we had back in Cambridge, and what was striking about this year conversation was how much the issue of income disparity, inequity, and housing prices were the almost uniform issue for all the cities, even in cities that we would not normally consider to be high class cities, even cities in Texas and the South are experiencing this pressures in part – in some of their neighborhood, and it is very curious phenomenon that is happening right now, that all cities are experiencing in very big ways, and we all are struggling on how to grapple with this issue, and a close second, in terms of most present issues, are issues of mobility and transportation. So, the kind of key issues that we are facing in San Francisco are being experienced, perhaps not quite as acutely, but are being experienced in many other cities across the country.
