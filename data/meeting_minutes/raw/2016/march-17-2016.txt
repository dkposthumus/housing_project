10.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Thank you, Commissioners. I would like to ask that we close the meeting today in honor of Isoken Omakaro, who was a member of the staff for 20 years, who passed away unexpectedly yesterday morning. Isoken was with the Department for 20 years. He was an immigrant from Nigeria, was schooled in US, and moved to the West Coast in the early 90s. He worked primarily in the last 15 years at the Public Information Counter. He was very well known at the counter. He worked very closed with staff, many, many members of the public knew Isoken, and he was really dedicated to public service and very much enjoyed his time there. He is survived by my wife and two children, who are 11 and 17, so, we ask for your support for his family, to the Department, and ask that you close the meeting in his honor. Thank you.

This was before you as a Discretionary Review as well. We had a joint hearing on the item. The Board heard the appeal last night and denied the appeal. There will be a subsequent appeal opportunity in the building permit, which has your discretionary review decision.
HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSSION:
Good afternoon Commissioners, Tim Frye, Department staff, here to share with you a couple of items from the Historic Preservation Commission hearing. The Commission unanimously approved the Central SOMA Context Statement and Historic Resource Survey. The findings of the Context Statement on the survey will be used to inform the Environmental Impact Report for the Central Corridor Area Plan as well as provide support for development of cultural heritage districts within the Central SOMA, particularly the Filipino Cultural Heritage District that is currently underway. The findings also will be used to inform the policies of the draft Central Corridor Area Plan and you should see those drafts policies when the plan comes to you in the future. Finally, the Commission forwarded a unanimous positive recommendation for the land local landmark designation of 34-45 Onondaga Avenue. This is historically known as the Alemany Emergency Health Center. This is a community sponsored designation, also supported by Supervisor Avalos. The two buildings that are inter-connected are known as one of the – as part of the City's early emergency health system and one of the buildings contain some WPA era mural, which the Arts Commission is currently seeking funding to restore. That is moving to the Board of Supervisors and Aaron Starr will certainly keep you updated on its progress thorough the Board. That concludes my comments, unless you have any questions.
