Commissioner Antonini:
All of the Commissioners should have received some figures that I had requested and I'm very grateful to Pedro Peterson of the staff for having put this togetherand also, I did have forwarded to you the State Controllers’ comments from February 9thof 2016, Mac Taylor’s comments which have been around for a while, but I thought it was very important to have these available again, as we consider the Mission Area Plan and any other projects in the Eastern Neighborhoods and Mission, in particular. Anyway, short version of these figures, is what I asked to do, is to give us an accurate figure of how many housing units were analyzed in Eastern Neighborhoods, as the number of units that could be produced under the Environmental Impact Report for Eastern Neighborhoods, and also the amount of square footage that could be allow of PDR loss under the plan. So, he gave me those figures for both the preferred option and for option C, which was the one has the highest numbers above. And then I asked for how many of, in terms of units, how many units were entitled? How many were under construction? How many were completed? I didn't bother with somebody who has pulled environmental papers, which is a long way from anything else we're looking at as ones that has the highest probability of being completed and we found out those numbers were relatively low. The number of units, when they added all three together, making the assumption that somebody has an entitlement is actually going to finish the project, which it is not always the case, as we know who is around 57 percent and in the Mission it was only 44 percent, and the numbers for PDR loss were even lower. For Eastern Neighborhoods in full, it was only about 25 percent and for the Mission it was about 7 percent. Using those figures and the other caveat and this is a matter that the public has availability of this. When you read it, you have to realize this does include some projects that were entitled before the Mission neighborhoods approval was completed and therefore or they were allowed to have a legalization because they had been entitled under the former 1M zoning that was in place so, some of the ones that counted as being constructed that actually had their approvals before Eastern Neighborhoods, but in any case the bottom line it is it’s relatively low and also couplewith the report that you'll read from Mac Taylor that shows a strong correlation between the amount of market rate housing built in a neighborhood, particularly low income neighborhood and the displacement. The more housing that is being built market-rate housing, the lower the rate of displacement as much as 47 percent displacement possibilities, if there is no building or very little market-rate housing, as little as 26 percent, if there is quite bit of market rate housing. I think while this is critical, we looked at any changes we may be making, we have to be very careful to allow the actual housing that has been analyzed and is planned to have any effect, which very little has been built so far, anyway hopefully, these will help us with future discussions, when questions come up, about how much has been built? How much hasn’t been built? How much is in the pipeline so I think really very grateful to Mr. Peterson for putting together the work on this.
Commissioner Richards:
I just wanted one item to note, I read the Small Business Commission last week or this week, actually voted unanimously for the chain store Formula Retail ban on Polk Street. Thank you.
4.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:

5.Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission
Land Use Committee:
·160360 Zoning Map - Rezoning Potrero HOPE SF Parcels at 25th and Connecticut Streets.Sponsor: Cohen. Staff: Snyder
On Monday the Land Use Committee considered the rezoning of 1101 Connecticut Street – or “Block X” of the Potrero Hope SF project. The proposal would rezone one of two parcels from “P” to “RM-2” and would rezone two parcels from 40-X to 50-X. The Planning Commission heard this item on May 5 of this year and voted unanimously to recommend approval to the Full Board. At the Land Use Committee there was no public comment and there were no questions or statement made by the Committee members. The Committee voted to move the item to the Full Board with a positive recommendation.
·160694 Conveyance of Real Property - 101 Hyde Street - Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development - $1.Sponsor: Kim. Staff: Not Staffed
·160550 Planning Code - Waiving Inclusionary Housing Requirements, Exempting Certain Floor Area from the Calculation of Gross Floor Area and Transferable Development Rights Requirements, and Authorizing Land Dedication at No Cost - 1066 Market Street.Sponsor: Kim. Staff: Chang
Also on the land use agenda was the Planning Code amendment Waiving Inclusionary Housing Requirements, Exempting Certain Floor Area from the Calculation of Gross Floor Area and TDR Requirements, and Authorizing Land Dedication at No Cost for the project at 1066 Market Street. The Planning Commission heard this item on June 16 of this year and voted to recommend approval to the Board of Supervisors.During public comment at the Land Use hearing there was resounding support from those who had initially opposed the project, feeling that the land dedication was a huge win for Community.
The Committee then voted unanimously to recommend the item to the Full Board with Chair Cohen stating that she wished all policy disagreements could be resolved as smoothly.
Full Board:
·160347 General Plan Amendment – Affordable Housing Bonus Programs. Sponsor: Mayor. Staff: Dischinger. First Read, Item 8
·160687 Planning Code - 100% Affordable Housing Bonus Programs. Sponsor: Mayor; Tang. Staff: Dischinger. First Read, Item 9
At the Full Board this week, the Supervisors considered the Planning Code and General Plan amendments for the Affordable Housing Bonus Program. When General Plan Amendment was called, Supervisor Peskin stated that he believes the language of the GPA is too broad, and should be “narrowed and tailored.” He also believes there should be input from community stakeholders to determine appropriate language for the GPA. He then noted that he intended to vote NO on the GPA and that four other board members would also be voting NO.
The question was then asked to the City Attorney about what would happen if there was a 5-5 split, because Supervisor Mar was absent. The City Attorney was not clear on whether a tied vote constituted disapproval or a failure to act. The City Attorney stated that if it was a failure to act, the GPA would come into effect after the 90 day deadline. This item was put on hold until the City Attorney could make a determination.
At the end of the hearing, the Board took up the AHBP items again. The City attorney confirmed that a 5-5 vote would constitute disapproval. There was also a question about what steps would be needed for the Planning Code Amendment to go forward if the GPA was disapproved. Supervisor Tang asked that both the GPA and PCA be continued for one week.
Supervisor Avalos then introduced following amendments which were accepted:
1) Prohibit any project using AHBP from demolishing any existing residential unit on any adjacent parcel; and
2) Urge the Planning Department to come up with a stronger business relocation program.
Supervisor Tang also introduced three amends to the Ordinance that she stated responded to the concepts in Supervisor Peskin and Mar's proposal and reflect discussions at the Land Use Committee as well.  Those amends include:
1. Adding three necessary findings the 328 review process for 100% affordable project. Also changing the appeals process to the Board of Supervisors;
2. Directing the City to research and review strategies to address neighborhood variations in income levels, particularly in relation to the mixed income AHBP proposals; and
3. Adding a requirement that 100% affordable projects include neighborhood serving uses on the ground floor, including but not limited to: grocery stores, clinics, nonprofit space, community centers, and libraries.
These amendments were also accepted
The Board then voted to continue the item for one week on a 6 to 4 vote with Supervisor Mar absent. Those that voted no on the continuance were Supervisors Kim, Peskin, Campos and Avalos.
·160534 Hearing - Appeal of Conditional Use Authorization - 32 Ord Street. Staff: Rodgers. Special Order 3:00 PM.Items 13-16
Next, the Board heard the CU appeal for 32 Ord Street. On this item, the Board voted to rescind the Planning Commission’s CU approval and modify it. The modifications included limiting the height of the planter boxes on the rear deck to 2’, and requiring transparent railing at the rear deck, amendments to the front and rear setbacks, and adjustments to the roofline. The board then voted unanimously to approve the CU.
·160550 Planning Code - Waiving Inclusionary Housing Requirements, Exempting Certain Floor Area from the Calculation of Gross Floor Area and Transferable Development Rights Requirements, and Authorizing Land Dedication at No Cost - 1066 Market Street. Sponsor: Kim. Staff: Chang. Passed First Read
·160694 Conveyance of Real Property - 101 Hyde Street - Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development - $1. Sponsor: Kim. Staff: Passed First Read
Finally the Board considered the amendments to the 1066 Market Street project, which the Board passed on first read.
Introductions:
There were no introductions of note this week.
BOARD OF APPEALS:
The Board of Appeals did meet last night, three items that maybe of interest to the Commission. First, we had appeals by the Academy of Art University for 22 Notices of Violation and Oenalty that were issued to 22 different properties. In this we established a deadline of July 1st for publication of the Existing Sites Technical Memorandum and Response to Comment with the Draft EIR. At the hearing last night, the Board of Appeals unanimously upheld our notice of violation and penalty and those deadlines remain.We on track, I am happy to say, to have those published by July 1stand we are also on track to have the certification of the EIR brought to you on July 28th.Second item is 2414 Lombard Street. You heard this as a discretionary review. It is a mandatory discretionary review for a medical cannabis dispensary known as The Apothecarium. It was heard as a DR by you last November, so it was an appeal brought forward by community groups in opposition to your approval of the project.At thehearing last night, the Board ofAppeals voted 2 to 2 to deny the permit, four votes were needed tooverturn a departmental action. There were – given that there were only four commissioners last night for this item, there were notsufficient votes to take action, so, by active law, you approvalwas upheld.The final item is the Van Ness Corridor permits to remove street trees, actually one permit to remove many street trees on the Van Ness Corridor in furtherance of the Van Ness Bus Rapid Transit Project, the appeal was the removal of trees and the board voted to uphold the permit to remove those trees.

SPEAKERS:Georgia Schuttish – Collective mid-block open space
1.The rear yard mid-block open space needs residential design guidelines that preserve and protect
2.Rear yards should not be flat-lotted, cemented over and fenced off from one another but should remain part of the residential collective open space
3.Water from these yards should be allowed to percolate into the ground not into the sewer – due to a trend to hardscape and have the yard – the exterior become an extension of interior space, this issue needs guidelines
4.Other RDG considerations
-No big boxes on rear
-Prevailing rooflines in rear yards need consideration particularly if peaked roofs
-Distinction between homes on hills vs. homes on flat streets must be clearer
-Roof decks and other decks often invade privacy.Also stair penthouses
