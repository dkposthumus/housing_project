COMMISSIONER MOORE:
I want to comment on items 16a & b, which was taken and resolved amicably by the opposing party. I’d like to use that as an example that the commission can support constructive dialogue, give some direction and comments that lead for reconsideration on how DRs are approached and I want to elevate that as an example. I’m sorry, item 19, you are correct. It is 3790-3792 21stStreet, a long drawn out conflict. I’m glad to see it resolved.
8.Director’s Announcements
Good afternoon Commissioners. The only announcement I have today is a request toadjourn the meeting in honor of Carla Johnson. Carla was the Director of the Mayor’s Office of Disability. She passed away on Sunday after a short illness. Carla was much too young to have passed from us at this point; she was a very tireless advocate for the disabled in San Francisco. She actually had a long career with City Government going all the way back as working as a carpenter for Public Works and many different jobs in City Government, and her most recent stint, she was a strong advocate for the disabled, so I would ask that we adjourn the meeting today in her honor.

10.Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission
LAND USE COMMITTEE:
•150969 Planning Code – Affordable Housing Bonus Programs.Sponsor: Mayor; Tang. Staff: Dischinger. Sent with no Recommendation
•160347 General Plan Amendment – Affordable Housing Bonus Programs.Sponsor: Mayor. Staff: Dischinger. Recommended
This week the Land Use Committee considered the Affordable Housing Bonus Program, which is sponsored by Mayor Lee and Supervisor Tang. It consists of two ordinances: a General Plan Amendment and a Planning Code Amendment. Commissioners, you considered this item at multiple hearings, most recently on February 25. At that hearing, you unanimously recommended approval of the General Plan Amendment[1]. On the Planning Code ordinance, you took no action on the program as a whole, but did provide recommendations on six topics: program eligibility, infrastructure support, urban design, public review and commission approval, preservation of small business, and affordability levels.
[1] This ordinance would add notes to the General Plan that the BOS “may adopt ordinances that would allow additional height/density in conjunction with additional affordability”.
This week at committee, Supervisor Tang introduced the following amendments to the program. First, for the mixed-income program she asked that the committee add the following:
1) prohibit the demolition of existing residential units (including rent-controlled units);
2) require approval via conditional use authorization;
3) direct the City to explore establishing a small business relocation fee, “right-of-first-refusal”, and other small business preservation tools,
4) require that early notification be given to commercial tenants and OEWD at least 18 months in advance;
5) add a findings section with reference to existing tools and other support available to small business tenants; and
6) include certain active uses to be replaced at the same square footage.
For the 100% Affordable program Supervisor Tang asked that one amendment be added, which is to prohibit the demolition of existing residential units and reminded the public that these projects would already be prohibited in RH-1 and RH-2 Districts. The Committee added these amendments.
The Supervisor also requested to divide the Planning Code file so that only the 100% affordable component would be forwarded to the Full Board in conjunction with the General Plan amendment. The Committee moved to forward the Planning Code amendment without recommendation. On the General Plan amendment, the Committee moved this out with a positive recommendation—despite Supervisor Peskin’s reservations.
Supervisor Peskin described his alternative proposal introduced on June 7. He described his proposal as the “Density Done Right; Development Without Displacement Program”. The proposal would help with the agreed upon goal to increase housing starts and is part of his broader housing solution that includes the now adopted Prop. C. He proposed duplicating Supervisor Tang’s proposal again so that he could delete much of the substance for the 100% affordable program and replace it with his alternative. He stated that this would still allow for CEQA review by the Planning Department, but would remove the need for a Planning Commission hearing. It would also allow the Board to consider his proposal alongside the Mayor & Supervisor Tang’s proposal. The Committee rejected this motion.
Supervisor Wiener explained his vote by saying that the City has a deep affordability crisis. And, that the AHBP is an elegant way to put housing on the ground. Supervisor Wiener said that he would prefer that the full AHBP program for both mixed–income and for 100% affordable be sent to the Full Board for consideration; however, he deferred to Supervisor Tang’s desire to only forward the 100% affordable program. Supervisor Peskin stated that the political reality is that the program will fail without his amendments.
Supervisor Cohen objected the assertion that the Committee was wasting it’s time and said that the Committee’s votes would create a public record for future generations to evaluate. On the alternative proposal, Supervisor Cohen asked if neighborhood AMIs could have unintended consequences like concentrating poverty in certain neighborhoods.
Supervisor Tang again expressed her desire to collaborate on a solution while urging Board Members to avoid placing new barriers on 100% Affordable Projects. Next week the Full Board will take up the 100% affordable portion of the AHBP program and the General Plan amendment. The remaining mixed-income portion of the AHBP was continued to the call of the Chair. Supervisor Peskin’s alternative was transmitted to the Department and is currently awaiting Commission review.
