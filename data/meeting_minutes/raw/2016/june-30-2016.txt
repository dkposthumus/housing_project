Commissioner Moore:
I was delighted to read in a Potrero Hill paper that the California College of Arts is to build 200 bed apartment complex and a 400 bed dorm both within the Cooper-Arkansas area. The first part about it is that a trustee donated the building - the parcel on which the 200 bedroom complex will be built, with retaining ownership of the land, but having CCA move forward with student housing. I think it is an incredible, strong sign and I'm sure we'll be following it closely and I think, it hopefully it will set a glaring example for many others to follow. For those of you, who have not seen this, I'll hand it around.
Commissioner Antonini:
I had given to our secretary Ionin an article that I had planned to speak on when we had our discussion last week about the Mission Area Plan 2020 but I didn’t, I couldn't find at that at that time, a member of the staff was able to send it to me. It is an article that appeared in the Chronicle a couple years ago from Enrico Moretti and the title of the article is How to Make SF Housing More Affordable, and professor Moretti explores the negative effects of delays of building housing in San Francisco and his article is even more valid today than it was when it was first written. As you may know, Mr. Moretti is the author of The New Geography of Jobs, which is a very interesting book about how the jobs of the 21stcentury have changed notably from what was the case a century ago or the last century. In addition to being a professor at UC Berkley of Economics, he is a resident of the Mission District, so he lives of which he speaks, which is unusual because often people who comment on things are not really involved in the academic world are not really in the midst of what they are commenting on. I think that is very interesting.He's the author of a new study, that I am going to try to get, a co-author rather, and it is the effects of the lack of housing in San Francisco to both employees and employers in terms of lost productivity,which sound like a very valid and appropriate type of thing to have as we continue our discussions of housing issues in San Francisco and the Mission District in particular. So, I will try to find out if it has been released and where we can have it for our consideration as we move forward.
6.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Good afternoon Commissioners, just one brief announcement today, as we are entering election season and ballot season in the Fall, there a number -- an unusually large numbers of ballot measures coming up, I think you'll hear about some of them today during Aaron’s report, and just wanted to take the time, take a moment to remind Commissioner and staff about activities related to ballot measures. We will send you the memo from the City Attorney's Office that reminds us what we can and cannot do during ballot measures, to take a position on ballot measures, but there is an unusually large number of the ballot measures, both of the City and State level this year that pertain to our work. So, we will send that memo to you as soon as possible.
7.Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission
LAND USE COMMITTEE:
•160660 Urging the San Francisco Legislative Delegation to Amend or Oppose the Proposed “By Right Housing Approvals” Budget Trailer Bill.Sponsors: Peskin; Mar, Kim, Yee, Avalos and Campos. Staff: Not Staffed
•160675 Urging the San Francisco Legislative Delegation to Work to Amend the Proposed “By Right Housing Approvals” Budget Trailer Bill.Sponsor: Wiener. Staff: Not Staffed
At Monday’s Land use committee hearing the Committee considered two Resolutions urgings amendments to the Governors by-right housing bill. One resolution was sponsored by Supervisor Peskin; and Co-sponsored by Supervisor’s Mar, Kim, Yee, Avalos and Campos and the other resolution was sponsored by Supervisor Wiener.
The Peskin Resolution asks that our representatives in Sacramento oppose the proposed bill unless certain amendments are made including:
A prohibition on the demolition of existing housing; a minimum baseline for as-of-right approval consisting of a set local Inclusionary Housing standard plus a premium increase; a requirement that approved development projects begin construction within 180 days of their approval; and that the approval of major developments continue to allow for public review and local discretionary approval as is currently provided by local laws.
Supervisor Wiener’s resolution urges amendments that guarantee the zoning-allowed height and number of units by-right, but to also allow local jurisdictions to retain the ability to promote good architecture and urban design, to adopt locally controlled inclusionary standards, to preserve historic buildings, affordable and rent-controlled housing stock, to limit demolitions, and to adopt labor and environmental standards.
Supervisor Wiener’s resolution also asks the state to pursue measures to increase state support for public transportation investments, and adopt reforms that prevent the abuse of the Ellis Act.
At the hearing, about 23 people spoke in favor of the Peskin Resolution, while two people spoke in favor of the Wiener Resolution.
The Committee then voted to forward both resolutions to the Full Board without recommendation.
FULL BOARD:
•160347 General Plan Amendment – Affordable Housing Bonus Programs. Sponsor: Mayor. Staff: Dischinger. First Read, Item 15
•160687 Planning Code - 100% Affordable Housing Bonus Programs. Sponsor: Mayor; Tang. Staff: Dischinger. First Read,
On Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors voted on two items related to the Affordable Housing Bonus Program. First, the Board voted 6-5 to reject the proposed General Plan Amendment. Supervisors Tang and Wiener spoke in support of this item, stating that the proposed language reflected the type of policy language appropriate for a General Plan. Further, both Supervisors expressed a desire to move forward with implementing much needed Affordable Housing Policies such as the AHBP.
Supervisor Wiener commended Supervisor Tang for her leadership, noting that it is not often we have a west side supervisor play an active leadership role in moving the dial on affordable housing. Wiener underscored a desire for the City to move past protest, discussion and conflict and towards solutions.
Supervisor Peskin spoke out in opposition to the General Plan amendment, stating that the proposed language was too broad and accordingly granted too much authority to the Planning Department to implement a future upzoning. While noting that the Board only has an up or down vote for the General Plan, Supervisor Peskin suggested that he would like to see a more narrowly crafted version of this General Plan Amendment move forward.
Supervisor Mar also commented on this item, thanking Supervisor Tang for her leadership on this issue and expressing a desire to work on implementing a 100% Affordable Bonus Program.
Next the Board considered the 100% affordable portion of the AHBP. Because the General Plan Amendment didn’t pass, the City Attorney noted that the Board could have a discussion of the item, but in order to take action, they would require General Plan Consistency findings from the Planning Commission.
Supervisor Tang proposed one amendment to the ordinance, the removal of the Northeast Waterfront Plan Area. She then asked the Board to continue this item until July 11th. Both actions passed with unanimous support. I would just note that on your calendar today is an item to find both Supervisor Tang and Peskin’s affordable housing ordinances consistent with the General Plan.
