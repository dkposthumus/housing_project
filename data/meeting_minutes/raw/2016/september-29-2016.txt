Land Use Committee:
·160509 Planning Code, Zoning Map - Rezoning 2070 Folsom Street. Sponsor: Campos. Staff: Salcedo.
At this week’s land use hearing, the Committee heard an Ordinance that amends the Planning Code by revising the Zoning and Height & Bulk District for 2070 Folsom Street, changing from its current designation as Public (P) with a Height and Bulk designation of 50-X, to Urban Mixed Use (UMU) with a Height and Bulk Designation of 85-X. This ordinance was heard at the Planning Commission on July 28th, and with a 5-0 vote, the Commission recommended that the BOS adopt this proposed ordinance. At the Land Use and Transportation Committee this week there were only a few brief public commenters, all in support of the proposed ordinance, and the Committee moved the item to the Full Board with a positive recommendation.
Full Board:
·160321 Planning Code - Housing Balance Report. Sponsor: Kim. Staff: D. Sanchez.Passed its First Read
·160426 Planning Code, Zoning Map - Rezoning Midtown Terrace Neighborhood. Sponsor: Yee. Staff: Starr.
The Midtown Terrace rezoning was also considered by the Full Board this week. At the Board hearing Supervisor Yee moved to remove the amendment added by Supervisor Wiener at the Land Use Committee that subjected the Midtown Terrace Neighborhood to the City’s Accessory Dwelling Unit program. Supervisor Campos seconded the amendment. The Board then voted to pass this item on first read with Supervisor Wiener as the only dissenting vote.

BOARD OF APPEALS:
The Board of Appeals did meet last night – only one item that may be of interest to the Commission.  Appeal of building permit for 1430-36thAvenue, which was before the Commission as a DR earlier this year.  At that hearing the Commission took DR to add an NSR restricting use of building to Single Family Dwelling (due to DR requestor concerns about the potential to use the ground floor as an illegal 2nddwelling unit).  The appeal was filed by the neighbor, who maintained concerns about the ground floor layout and extension of the building at the rear.  The Board of Appeals unanimously denied the appeal and approved the permit as conditioned by the Planning Commission.
