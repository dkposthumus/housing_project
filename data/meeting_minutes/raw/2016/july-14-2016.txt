Commissioner Moore:
I want to acknowledge the update of the Institutional Master Plan for the Academy -- for the Art Institute -- the San Francisco Arts Institute. The update is indeed answering the questions at least putting to record -- to record a more complete description of the institution, what they do and which facilities are they doing it? How their housing supports their operation? I appreciate the update, which was added to our last week's Commission package.
Commissioner Antonini:
Mr. Ionin, if you can start putting up some those pictures. I am going to speak a little bit about the Erie Alley. I spoke about this in the past, and this is a classic example of the broken windows problems that occur when criminal activities are not taken care of early, and they morph into more and more bad things. It started with graffiti on this alley, which is an alley off of South Van Ness and near 14thStreet and originally I was called by Larry Matthew, who owns the property at 245 South Van Ness. Interestingly enough most of his clients are PDRs firms. He has drapery, manufacture California doors, ceramic tiles, an art gallery and a sewing institution, the kind of things we're trying to protect. Anyway, what happened early on was the graffiti problem and one of the people involved with this was Architect Ian Birchall who has offices off of this alley. He was attacked by graffiti vandals, trying to clean it up, and instead of doing anything these people eventually were arrested, but they were never getting any significant sentences, so what happened the property owner is just keep getting charged so much money that they ended up leaving the graffiti alone, and now it’s morphed into a very bad situation, as you can see, because you got a lot of possibly homeless or at least people we know they're involved in drug dealing, we know they are involved and a chop shop for bicycle theft, we know there is prostitution, all those things that are going on, also, vicious attacks on not only the owners of these properties, but also on a young family, who is there with two small children, they have thousands of dollars of damage done to their place. Their garage was blocked one day, when they tried to get the people out of there, their car was broken into, and the Christmas presents were stolen out of there, as well as baby strollers. They have to spent $5,000 on broken windows, a broken front door, the electrical and water services were cut off to their apartment. These are the kinds of things that have happened, because if we been firm to start with on the graffiti problem, that might have ended the problem. The word has got out that this is an alley where you can hang out, do criminal activities, perhaps live illegally as far as I am concerned, and driving -- potentially driving away PDR firms and young families, who are trying to make a living or in that area. I would urge the City to try to look into this particular issue although it’s maybe not the only place that is a problem, but it is right in the heart of areas we hear constant cries to save PDRs and save families with children, and we're not doing much in this instance. So I would hope someone can look into the problem on Erie Alley.
Commissioner Johnson:
I will switch the subject a little bit and make a little bit of a of mental leap, so coming up in our upcoming calendar we have Potrero and the Sunnydale Hope SF Projects, the design and development agreements, and one of the things about those projects is that they are part of a rental assistance demonstration cluster, which also through a lot of rigmarole include supportive services, which also includes childcare and one of the questions I have since started asking after I ended my seat on getting a MTA hearing, which is also happening, is about how do our building code and zoning requirements support or not support the ability to build childcare facilities in San Francisco. So, I reiterate my call for information about that particularly in light of looking at the development agreements for Potrero and Sunnydale, where there are actual policies and plans in place to provide childcare as part of the suite supportive services for the public housing and future mixed income residents there. So, I think it is really important I think that we should definitely be addressing that, and as a Commission make ourselves knowledgeable about how our Planning Code and Building Code are supporting those types of facilities.
Commissioner Richards:
Just one comment I think to Commissioner Antonini, I refer back to the Mission Plan and the fact that some of the bigger issues that are pretty un-trackable as you showed zoning solutions, there is a whole host of solutions, a whole host of approaches to try to solve some of these problems and I completely agree with you, they need to be solved and it’s not just something for us. I think that our role would be make sure we can put navigation centers and things like that, once these individuals are able to get places to live in appropriate neighborhoods, and things like, we do whatever we can, your thoughts is on top of everybody’s mind in the City about the issue.
11.Director’s Announcements
Jeff Joslin, Acting Planning Director:
No announcements on part of either myself or the other Director. There is no report in your packet today.
12.Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission
LAND USE COMMITTEE:
•160492 Hearing - Impacts of the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act Sponsor: Wiener. Staff: Starr.
At this week’s land use committee, I participated in a hearing called by Supervisor Wiener on the impacts of the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act on the city’s various codes and regulations. The health Department was the lead agency and the Department of Building Inspection also presented. During the presentation I went over the various use definitions in the Planning Code that would need to be amended to bring our local land used controls in synch with the proposed new state law on medial cannabis, and I reiterated the recommendations the Planning Commission made as part of its report on MCDs, which was done in 2014.
The supervisors were quite attentive during our presentation. Supervisor Cohen stopping staff’s presentation several times to ask questions about our existing controls, and was particularly concerned about the over concentration of MCDs on the eastern part of the city.
Supervisor Weiner spoke about how the proposed State law encompasses more than just retail outlets and thanked staff for providing information as to how other uses related to the Cannabis industry would be regulated.
There was a good amount of public comment on this item. Some speakers were concerned about the new state law, while other spoke of gaps in our current MCD regulations. The time was then filed as it was not an action item.
•160252 Planning, Administrative Codes - Construction of Accessory Dwelling Units Citywide. Sponsor: Peskin. Staff: Haddadan.
Next, the Land Use Committee heard an Ordinance proposed by Supervisor Peskin to allow ADUs citywide. This Ordinance was considered by this Commission on June 16 of this year and the Commission voted to recommend approval with modifications on a 4 to 1 vote.
Supervisor Peskin took the Commission’s recommendation to remove the cap on the number of ADUs per lot in buildings with 5 or more units, while maintaining a cap of one ADU in buildings with 4 or less units. The Supervisor also recommended a unit size minimum of 350 square feet for studios and 550 square feet for one bedroom ADUs.
Supervisor Wiener raised concern that the minimum size could prevent an ADU to be built in situations where there is less than 350 square feet available within a building. Supervisor Peskin expressed interest in allowing ADUs in such circumstances with Zoning Administrator approval.
Another Planning Commission recommendation was to further study the issue of individual sale of ADUs. In response, Supervisor Peskin made amendments that would allow ADUs to be subdivided and sold separately in buildings that are already condominiums with no eviction history. Those ADUs would only be sold to household with income up to 120% of AMI.
Supervisor Wiener also asked for the soft story seismic retrofit program for ADU to remain intact and Supervisor Peskin was open to that.
Lastly, the Planning Commission recommended that the ADUs be allowed to expanded under bay windows, and cantilevered rooms. Supervisor Peskin incorporated that amendment. However, these infills would be subject to neighborhood notification. Expansion into these spaces is currently not subject to notifications.The item was then forwarded to the Full Board with no recommendation on a unanimous vote.
FULL BOARD:
•160360 Zoning Map - Rezoning Potrero HOPE SF Parcels at 25th and Connecticut Streets. Sponsor: Cohen. Staff: Snyder.PASSED Second Read
•160687 Planning Code - 100% Affordable Housing Bonus Program. Sponsor: Mayor, Tang.
At the Board hearing this week, the Supervisors heard The Mayor & Supervisor Tang’s Density Bonus ordinance for 100% affordable projects. Commissioners, you most recently considered General Plan compliance of this program and an alternative program sponsored by Supervisors Peskin and Mar on June 30th. At that hearing, you found both versions to be consistent with General Plan policies.
This week at the full Board the tone was collaborative. Supervisor Peskin thanked supervisor Tang noting that the road was long but that we made the proposal better together. Supervisor Avalos spoke of the importance of this program in helping to revitalized stalled neighborhood commercial districts. He mentioned that in his district he already knew of two projects that could benefit from passage of this ordinance. Notably, Supervisor Avalos also said he supported a mixed-income program and that he looked forward to developing that program further before the fall.
Supervisor Avalos made a motion for two amendments. The first amendment would allow but not require the Commission to sculpt the bonus floors of projects under the standards of Planning Code Section 261.1, when recommended by the Planning Director. This code section protects southern light onto narrow east-west streets. Via Avalos’s amendment this Section could be used for setbacks as long as the setbacks did not reduce the number of residential units.
Avalos’s second amendment would require the submission of a relocation plan when required by state or federal law. Both of his amendments passed.
Supervisor Yee requested an amendment for clarity. He noted that the program was not available in any RH-1 or RH-2 district but asked that the ordinance include language to specify that this does include the RH-1(D) district. This amendment also passed.
With that, the BOS unanimously adopted the ordinance on first reading. This is a huge accomplishment for our housing team, specifically I’d like to acknowledge the hard work done by Kearstin Dischinger, Menaka Mohan, Paolo Ikezoi who spent countless hours developing and refining this proposal and doing outreach to the public and the Supervisors.
•160660 Urging the San Francisco Legislative Delegation to Amend or Oppose the Proposed “By Right Housing Approvals” Budget Trailer Bill. Sponsor: Peskin; Mar, Kim, Yee, Avalos, Campos. Staff: Rodgers.Adopted on a 6 to 5 vote with Supervisors Breed, Cohen, Farrell, Tang and Wiener voting against it.
•160675 Urging the San Francisco Legislative Delegation to Work to Amend the Proposed “By Right Housing Approvals” Budget Trailer Bill. Sponsor: Wiener. Staff: Rodgers.This item was not adopted by the reverse vote of the previous item.

Summary of Board Activities July 11-15, 2016Planning Commission Report: July 14, 2016
Finally, this week I also gave a presentation to the Cannabis Task force on land use considerations for the upcoming vote on Proposition 64, which would legalize Adult Use Cannabis in California. The Task Force is charged with making recommendations to the Board of Supervisors on how the city should respond should this proposition pass in November. Land use is one area that the task force is considering. For your information, I included a copy of the presentation in my email to you earlier today.

SPEAKERS:Georgia Schuttish – Section 317 loophole
There is a loophole in Sect 317(b) (7) that allows for the loss of good sized units- housing.
As long as not more than 25% of the second unit is lost (Commissioners have right to make than 20%) this can happen whether the change is in the existing footprint or an expanded footprint.
This loophole should be closed because they are often turned into single family homes.It should be part of Section 317 reform.
Units should not be reduced, or absorbed or illegally merged.
Perhaps this should be done through a variance but not due to a loophole.
Here are some streets where this has occurred:

2.Noe
