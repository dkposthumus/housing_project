Commissioner Antonini:
A couple of things in the news, sorry to see what appears that the legislator had cut back on funding for a mass transit project that would affects us in San Francisco and the entire Bay Area, and that is unfortunate, we need more of a realization of the importance of mass transit, not just for those who live in the middle of dense urban areas, but for the entire state and the entire country, because much of the business and decisions are made in dense urban areas, and effects people even if they don't necessarily live there. The good news is, I think, I read in the Business Times today, there is a possible bid on Parcel H, which is the final parcel for Transbay and that could generate large amount of revenue, that is badly needed towards the Transbay Terminal and other projects, so hopefully that will in fact come to pass, it is very interesting development site that joins the Transbay Terminal.
Commissioner Richards:
A couple things, first, I was able to attend a panel discussion on gentrification and displacement that we heard about last week. It was hosted by the Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development. It was a really interesting session. We had three panelists and they were, excuse me, I have it here somewhere, Miriam Zsuk from the Institute for Research on Labor Employment, UC Berkeley. She did, her and Karen Chapel, did the displacement study and Antonio Diaz from PODER, People Organizing to Demand Environmental and Economic Rights, and Gordon Chin, who many of you probably know was the founder of CCDC, Chinatown Community Development Center, really interesting panel discussion. The paper is going to be released, or has been released.I suggest you go to their website on Berkeley. There were two neighborhoods in San Francisco that were highlighted, one was Chinatown and the other one was the Mission in terms of displacement, an interesting read. From the summary, from the nine county Bay Area, a couple of things to note, that the displacement crisis is not yet half over, according to the scholars, but there still is half of neighbors in the nine county Bay Area they are quite stable, but just becoming poorer and displacement stand far beyond gentrifying neighborhoods, but actually extends to the affluent neighborhoods as well. Lastly, I think the most important take away, and I think, speaking to the Director, when we talked about the Mission Interim Controls, they actually list a strategy on anti-displacement that it goes far beyond just zoning. It includes preservation strategists of homes, tenant protections, asset building and local economic development, affordable housing production, taxing, and additional land use controls, so it is a real comprehensive look how you can approach this displacement situation. One other thing, probably two or three weeks back, many of you might have heard it or read that there was a woman in Burlingame who have lived in her existing cottage for 66 years, since 1950, she was 97, and she got a 30 days eviction notice, and there was a big brouhaha nationally and internationally and when I read that, I thought, wow, the stress in this person must be incredible, she has not where to go, and she is 97 years old. It was a great disappointment, yesterday, I read that she passed away, so I am not saying that the eviction caused her death, but she died of some type of flu or a cold that probably is the result of a lower immune system because of stress. I’m making a stress there, but I do think that displacement does affect people psyche and does affect their health in ways that are not yet all understood.
Commissioner Moore:
Thank you for bringing that up. Some people would refer to it as root stress, which has been attributed to the kinds of symptoms you are describing. On another note, 1567 Polk, President Fong and myself met with staff to look at further façade development for the Polk Street side of a project, which was approved by the Commission with the caveat that the staff and the developer was asked participating in the discussion, would work on the façade. It was a constructive discussion. There will be one more follow-up. I feel we are on the right track and appreciate staff very actively engaging in the discussion.
