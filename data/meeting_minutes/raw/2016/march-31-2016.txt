Commissioner Antonini:
This week in SanFrancisco Business Times there is a list ofthe one hundred firms thatreceived the most funding inventure capital, which generally arenon-publically traded firms, sometimes call unicorns,and among that group, overwhelmingmajority, in terms of dollars wasfirms inSan Francisco, and I haven't lookedat it close enough to know if we have a majority of the number offirms here,so it’s a good sign because it means it’s gonna create jobs direct andindirect jobs, commercial andresidential construction, so obviously people who are investing have confidence in the market that is being created by thesefirms in San Francisco, and I think it is agood thing for all us, we just have to addressthe demands that are created bythese jobs, and it’s better to have ademand than not have a demand and is alot easier to address a goodthing than to try to helpsomethingthat isnegative.So, I am very much happy to see this kind of thing.
Commissioner Richards:
I guess, five quick things, first to Commissioner Antonini’s point I did read the same article, however; in this morning or yesterday’s Business Times online, it now talks about a lot of these unicorn companies having what are called down-rounds, which means somebody who put in money prior to a current round are actually taking loses, because the companies are valued less than the last time money was put in.They also have a barometer on the number of a lay-offs at these firms have, you can see them online, you can check it.Ibelieve there were 5, 6 or 7 companies with atotal of 5 hundred employees they had to lay-off because of thefunding that they had was not sufficientto keep going atthe current rate that they were. So, obviously nobody wants to see anybody hurt in an economic way, but there are changes that are happening right now as well, and I just wanted to note that.A couple of other things that I wanted to note, one this week's Examiner on Tuesdayhad “San Francisco is Eviction City” it isinteresting the rateof eviction is now approaching – it will approach a forecast whathappened in the year of the lastbubbledot com 1.0,I think I’ve said this before, I’ll say it again, itis a supply issue, it is a demand issue, is astabilization issue of existing housing,and there is also a loss of existing housing to uses that have some good public policy goalswhen taken too far they have a negative effect, that beingshort-term rentals and student housing.Secondly, San Francisco, and this is a good thing, had a record breaking number of tourists last year. This was in the Examiner on Thursday - Wednesday we had 24.6 million visitors in 2015, an increase of nearly 3 percent,$9.3 billion was spent in the City, which is fantastic, it supports our local economy, it is probably our biggest industry,the amount that that breaks downto is about $25 million a day that these tourists are spending, which is fantastic.The one thing, I want to bring up is, I think, this is a fantastic commerce and industry statistic, I want tomake sure from another publicpolicy point of view we're not losing housing to these visitors, we are building hotelsfast enough, and also havingwhat I call reasonable limits andrules on short-term rentals, which I hope to see that we eventually get.The fourth thing is, on July 2ndlast year, this Commission voted to moveforward with an initiationwith a nomination of alandmark tree, out in Laurel Heights, it was a very contentious issue,we did it because we thought that the tree was going to be cut down, there was a pair,and the first one was cut down,after much due…the Board of Urban Forestsvoted to landmark the tree and it ismoving now to the Board of Supervisors,I actually lost track of it until the Emery Green article was on Monday and Tuesday of this week’s paper - - last week’s paper.One last thing thatkind of hit me is,we have Prop M issues are comingbefore us soon, because we havemore squarefootage in the pipeline than we have allocation, andJohn King, this morning in the Chronicle, wrote about a buildingon Second Streetand called it, and I know this isn’t just about aesthetics, I read this and it kind of hit me,thebuilding at Second Street where LinkedIn is, is an overbearing 26-story glass box on one prominent cornerthat has all the charm and wealth of a tailor packing crate, he said, instead the newcomerserves as a cautionary tale, telling what canhappen whenof towndevelopers and architects have their own vision of what a City, San Francisco should look like, further he says, thebuilding the 222 2nda mirror more often, is a black hole that sucks all the mean out of finegrain, movesfrom certainly angles the blunt cubes and pleated cloaks are striking in a Darth Vader sort of way, which I think,I've used the term Darth Vader buildings in the past,incredibly ugly, incredibly dark, and they do create a void. They’re more often solemn than sleek. And then lastly, what makes 222 2ndStreet so galling, is that it is an alien presence in a well-established setting, where other recent buildings have done their best to add to the ambiance rather than act as if it doesn't exist. So, obviouslywe are gonna go beyond the beauty contest on the Prop M allocation, we are going to consider another items,but certainly when I read this article the way the building fits in with its environment also isgoing to be something I am going to lookup. Thank you.
D.DEPARTMENT MATTERS
5.Director’s Announcements
Dan Sider – Acting Planning Director:
Commissioners, Good afternoon, as you know Director Rahaim is not the office right now, he will be back next week.We don’t have anything to present to you, but off-course we are happy to respond to any questions or comments you might have.

E.GENERALPUBLIC COMMENT – 15 MINUTES
At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting.Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
SPEAKERS:Georgia Schuttish – Demo vs. Alterations
1.Alterations are often demos. They mean the loss of affordable housing.
2.Alterations do not always keep the number of units. The property absorbs the second unit during construction and re-sale of the property as large, luxury single family home.
3.The Staff is working on the Mission Interim Controls and changes to Section 317.The Interim Controls are working to prevent loss of rent controlled unit through demolition, merger or conversion
4.Alterations need to be included in these Controls.Close loophole where a unit reduced in size up to 25% is not considered a merger.
5.Existing units lost should not be compensated for by massive homes that have a second unit in RH-1 and RH-2 purporting to solve the housing crisis while real units are lost.There is no real increase in housing and these high end projects add to the problem.
Donald Dussup – Housing
The Commission Hearing Procedures provide for presentations by staff; followed by the project sponsor team; followed by public comment for and against the proposal.Please be advised that the project sponsor team includes: the sponsor(s) or their designee, lawyers, architects, engineers, expediters, and/or other advisors.

CEQA Appeal Rights under Chapter 31 of the San Francisco Administrative Code
If the Commission’s action on a project constitutes the Approval Action for that project (as defined in S.F. Administrative Code Chapter 31, as amended, Board of Supervisors Ordinance Number 161-13), then the CEQA determination prepared in support of that Approval Action is thereafter subject to appeal within the time frame specified in S.F. Administrative Code Section 31.16.  This appeal is separate from and in addition to an appeal of an action on a project.  Typically, an appeal must be filed within 30 calendar days of theApproval Action for a project that has received an exemption or negative declaration pursuant to CEQA.  For information on filing an appeal under Chapter 31, contact the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors at City Hall, 1 Dr. Carlton B. Goodlett Place, Room 244, San Francisco, CA 94102, or call (415) 554-5184.  If the Department’s Environmental Review Officer has deemed a project to be exempt from further environmental review, an exemption determination has been prepared and can be obtained on-line athttp://www.sf-planning.org/index.aspx?page=3447. Under CEQA, in a later court challenge, a litigant may be limited to raising only those issues previously raised at a hearing on the project or in written correspondence delivered to the Board of Supervisors, Planning Commission, Planning Department or other City board, commission or department at, or prior to, such hearing, or as part of the appeal hearing process on the CEQA decision.
