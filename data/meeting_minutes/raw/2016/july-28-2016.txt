Commissioner Antonini:
In the Chronicle on Tuesday, July 26, a very unfortunate story about -- Albert Samuel’s clock on Market Street, which has been in existence for 100 years and painstakingly repaired and made to work, and has been frequently vandalized with graffiti and needless destruction, and I think this is terrible. I connect it to land use because we have all these comments about activating streets, and often we say the businesses there are not activating the streets there, their employees are not coming out, a bunch of reasons, I think one of the biggest reasons on some of the streets is, people are not really feel safe being there, when there is violent activities occurring frequently there, the kind of things like the destruction of this clock, and I think we have to move away from the culture of non-punishment, because I think we ask for problems and we ended up getting them, because the word is out, if one is caught they won't be held accountable for their actions, and if they're caught the penalty will be very small, modest, and the attitude now is, if no one gets hurt, it’s not really – it’s not a violent crime, so, therefore we don’t have to do much. They have a different attitude in San Diego, they had a problem with a graffiti-vandal, who, between ages 12 and 16, had caused over $100,000 of damage and they documented it they caught him and told his parents, you know, they had to make amends for it, and had to cover the costs and they refused to do so, either the city or the county put a lien against their house, and that changed the attitude in San Diego, they don't have a lot of problems with graffiti because there is some teeth in their laws, and I think we need to take that sort of attitude in San Francisco, if we reallywant to have vibrant, safe and attractive streets, and we keep repairing these treasures that are historical, and they continually are being destroy by vandals, and the same happens with children's playgrounds, that we spend valuable tax dollars and make them pay for what they do. I'd like to see that has a way of helping us to make our streets things that people can enjoy once again.
Commissioner Richards:
We're having before us – I want to discuss briefly, so please indulge me. We’re having before us a lot of projects that resulted in demolition, de-facto demolitions, actual demolitions, dwelling units mergers, and the policy issues that are coming up that I keep bringing up over and over, that we really, I think we need to look through the lens of is the demolition of rent control units, the demolition of relatively affordable housing, and that is a term we are going to have to figure out, what that actually means, and density equity we actually have two of these today coming up.I went back to the Housing Element and there several policies that jumped out on me that I really think we need to pay attention to when we approve these projects, one is discourage the policy 2.1.Objective 2: Retaining system housing units and promote safety and maintenance without jeopardizing affordability. Policy 2.1: Discourage the demolition of sound existing housing, unless the demolition results in a net increase in affordable housing. So, if we’ve demolishing housing that it is relatively affordable, and we are creating larger units at a higher a price per square foot, we are going backward, that goes against this policy. Policy 2.6: Discourage conversion of housing supply to de-facto commercial use and short-term rentals, that’s one here we have those issues come up, we designed issue so they wouldn’t be able rented easily, etc. So, I think we're on to that one. Objective 3: Protect the affordability of the existing housing stock, especially rental units. Policy 3.1: Preserve rental units, especially rent control units to meet the City affordable housing needs. So, when we get these demolitions we need to understand whether or not we're taking, actually rent-controlled units off the market or not, and if it we are what are we getting in its replacement. We approved a project on Lombard Street that was a Joe Toboni project, we did get rid-off of two rent control units, but we got about 3 BMR units and 8 additional market rate too, that actually help - we were in a better position in the end of the day than we were. It is not hard and fast thing, but we need to consider what we're getting in return. Policy 3.3: Maintain balance and the affordability of existing housing stock by supporting affordable moderate ownership opportunities? Is it a 7,000 square foot home at $1400 a foot? I doubt it! Is it a small unit that is relatively affordable that would be demolishing if somebody could actually buy a starter home and get in? Probably. And the last one Policy 3.4: Preserve nationally affordable housing types, such small and older ownership units. I'm imagining when we actually see the redefinition of Section 317, we’re potentially we are going to have more under what we consider demo. I don’t know yet, but I am assuming, based on what I understand that would be the case.I want to remind myself and the rest of the Commission that these policies is – we really need look at those policies through all these projects through the lens of these policies, and the Element and take a look at it.There are demos we approved last week, San Bruno Avenue was a small cottage on very large lot, wasn’t historic at all, actually there is no integrity. We approved 4 units, where one unit used to be, that make sense, is not a hard and fast rule, we are looking at. We need to make sure that we just don’t take these project by project, and I hope we look at them through the policy lenses. Second quick item in Sunday’s paper, Airbnb, third annual report by the Chronicle, I don’t want to get into all the details, but the end result was basically they said that Airbnb is not causing housing crisis, it is exacerbating, so, it is a good read, take a look at it. I think with once we sort this out with whether or not we can actually have real enforcement on Airbnb, we can actually figure out what the impact would be, but until then everyone is guessing. And lastly, the latest San Francisco Business Times, talks about expecting delays in traffic, on what it does to the economy. What it does to track people here to the Bay Area? So, it is a balance between jobs, housing, transportation, and other things. If we keep adding housing, we can’t have ways to get around the City or the Bay Area. It is causing more problems; we really need to figure this out. We had an MTA joint Planning Commission hearing last week; it was a really good meeting because we started talking about these issues. It was another good reading in the San Francisco Business Times this week Chronicle. Sorry for taking so long.

Land Use Committee:
·No Planning Items at Land Use this week.
Full Board:
·160632 Planning, Administrative Codes - Planning Department Fees - Future Fee Adjustments. Sponsor: Mayor. Staff: DiSanto. PASSED Second Read
·160657 Planning, Administrative Codes - Construction of Accessory Dwelling Units Citywide.Sponsor: Farrell, Wiener, Peskin. Staff: Haddadan. PASSED Second Read
·160477 Planning Code - Wireless Telecommunications Services Facilities.Sponsor: Avalos. Staff: Masry. Passed First Read
·160683 Public Hearing - Appeal of Final Environmental Impact Report Certification - 901-16th Street and 1200-17th Street Project.Staff: Jones. Items 49-52
Also at the Board was the appeal of the Planning Commission’s certification of the Final EIR for 901-16thStreet. You may recall that the project proposes 395 units, 25,000 square feet of retail, and 50,000 square feet of onsite open space on a large site that was once the Pacific Rolling Mill Lumber Yard.  It's located in lower Potrero Hill, at 16th and Mississippi.
The site currently contains a brick office building, which is a historic resource under CEQA, and several metal warehouse buildings that have been determined to not be resources.
The Appellants raised a number of issues including height, PDR loss, traffic, and historic resources.  The biggest source of contention was the rejection of the alternative supported by the appellants, termed the "Metal Shed Reuse Alternative", which would retain the metal sheds for PDR use and reduce the unit count to 177.  This alternative was included at the request of some members of the community; while it was rejected for a number of reasons and most especially for the fact that it would reduce the project’s unit count by over 200, the appellants focused on the issue of financial feasibility.
Although the appellants were contesting many issues associated with the approval of the project and not the environmental review, they chose not to appeal the Large Project Authorization to the Board of Appeals, stating that they didn’t pursue that appeal because “the project was code compliant.”
In the end The Board of Supervisors voted 9-1 (Peskin opposing) to uphold the Planning Commission's certification of the Environmental Impact Report.
In a cautionary tale for Supervisors and Commissioners alike, Supervisor Cohen had to be recused from the vote because of comments she made during the hearing regarding voluntary community benefits the sponsor was providing, She asked that he give more and the sponsor immediately offered up an additional $800,000. At that point, the City Attorney reminded the Board that the question before them was the adequacy of the CEQA review and they should only be considering issues pertinent to that.  After conferring with the attorneys, Supervisor Cohen asked the Board to recuse her from the vote to avoid any perception that the vote was tainted.  Other supervisors started asking many questions about the appropriateness of negotiating with developers.  The City attorney repeated that such conversations shouldn’t be part of CEQA appeal hearings.  A very puzzled Board voted to recuse Supervisor Cohen, and then immediately thereafter voted to uphold the EIR certification.

BOARD OF APPEALS:
Board of Appeals did meet last night, a couple of items first; the Board of Supervisors did confirm the reappointment of Commissioner Rick Swig's, Frank Fung, and Darryl Honda to the Board of Appeals for a 4-year term. Darryl Honda is the current President, and Commissioner Fung is the current Vice President of the Board of Appeals. Two items that were decided last night, I think they might be of interest to the Commission, both relate to the ongoing efforts to retain PDR uses and insure that those uses are enforced. First is a letter of determination for 425 Brannan Street, this I found that the second story of the building had been illegally converted to an office use, giving that is not permit history establishing an office use, the appellant provided permit history that showed office to office, where the permit listed the existing uses of office and proposed use of office as evidence of an ongoing legal office use of property. I pointed out that was never apermit that went from the previous industrial use to an office use, that actually authorized the change of use, but the Board felt that the permit history was sufficient to confirm that there was a legal office use. One of the facts here, that -- we felt this supported our decision that had been used during the 90s and the Zoning District Office is not allowed since 1990, but in the 90’s was used by SF Weekly as their office and under the Planning Code that is very squarely within a definition of business service, which is an allowed use office is not, but the Board felt this was legal offices in the building and overturned my determination. We had another notice of violation penalty, that -- was Corey Teague have issued, it was for illegal conversion of the PDR previously a contractors office to general office use, is in M-1 zoning district, it does allows office use, but it is also, within the area subject to the interim moratorium, that has been in place since September or October of 2014 and this use was established in that location in 2015 picture I think we had a very strong case and the Board unanimously upheld our determination. This is one of the sites that have an application pending for a large project under Central SOMA. We’ve seen couple of these has been in the Central SOMA area, actually both of the one last night, were under Central SOMA – will be under Central SOMA. I want to make aware of that. Thank you.

ACADEMY OF ART UNIVERSITY PROJECT-Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report -Academy of Art University (AAU) is a private postsecondary academic institution that occupies buildings throughout the City (predominantly in the northeast quadrant). AAU plans on expanding its facilities and programs to accommodate a projected on-site student enrollment of approximately 17,282 students and 3,511 faculty and staff by 2020, resulting in a total increase of approximately 6,100 students and 1,220 faculty and staff.  The Proposed Project consists of four general components: study area growth, project site growth, legalization of prior unauthorized changes, and shuttle service expansion. Study area growth consists of approximately 110,000 net square feet (sf) of additional residential uses (to house approximately 400 students, equivalent to about 220 rooms) and 669,670 sf of additional institutional space in 12 geographic areas (study areas) where AAU could occupy buildings to accommodate future growth. The study areas generally include the following areas: Study Area 1 (SA-1), Lombard Street/Divisadero Street; SA-2, Lombard Street/Van Ness Avenue; SA-3, Mid Van Ness Avenue; SA-4, Sutter Street/Mason Street; SA-5, Mid-Market Street; SA-6, Fourth Street/Howard Street; SA-7, Rincon Hill East; SA-8, Third Street/Bryant Street; SA-9, Second Street/Brannan Street; SA-10, Fifth Street/Brannan Street; SA-11, Sixth Street/Folsom Street; and SA-12, Ninth Street/Folsom Street. Project site growth consists of six additional sites that have been occupied, identified, or otherwise changed by AAU since publication of the September 2010 Notice of Preparation (NOP) for this EIR. The six project sites would include a total of 411,070 sf of institutional, bus storage, and community facility uses. The project sites include the following addresses: 2801 Leavenworth Street (The Cannery) (Assessor’s Block/Lot: 0010/001); 700 Montgomery Street (Assessor’s Block/Lot:0196/028); 625 Polk Street (Assessor’s Block/Lot:0742/002); 150 Hayes Street (Assessor’s Block/Lot:0811/022); 121 Wisconsin Street (Assessor’s Block/Lot:3953/004); and 2225 Jerrold Avenue (Assessor’s Block/Lot:5286A/020). The Proposed Project also includes extension of AAU’s shuttle service to serve growth in the study areas and at the project sites. The Proposed Project also includes legalization of changes in use and/or appearance undertaken without benefit of permits prior to issuance of the NOP at 28 of AAU’s 34 existing sites. The Proposed Project includes the occupation and use of existing buildings, as well as construction activities that would be limited to interior tenant improvements, exterior modifications such as signage, window replacements, and security system installation, and in limited circumstances, seismic upgrades.
NOTE: The public hearing on the Draft EIR is closed. The public comment period for the Draft EIR ended on April 27, 2015. The Planning Commission does not conduct public review of Final EIRs.

ACADEMY OF ART UNIVERSITY- Initiation ofPlanning Code Text Amendmentsrelated to Academy of Art University (AAU)- The Planning Commission will consider the proposal from the Planning Department to reject two Ordinances proposed by AAU and to instead initiate an Ordinance developed by the Planning Department for a limited conversion of Existing Housing to Student Housing Use for two specific properties.  The Ordinance recommended for Initiation by the Planning Department would waive the applicability of the prohibition on conversion of Residential Units to Student Housing set forth in Planning Code Section 317(e) to 2209 Van Ness Avenue (Lot 005 in Assessor's Block 0570) and 2211 Van Ness Avenue (Lot 029 in Assessor's Block 0570). The proposed Ordinance would also establish criteria for conditional use authorization applicable to conversions to Student Housing for 2209 Van Ness Avenue and 2211 Van Ness Avenue; make findings under the California Environmental Quality Act; make findings under Planning Code Section 302 of public necessity, convenience, and welfare; make findings of consistency with the General Plan and the eight priority policies of Planning Code Section 101.1; and provide for expiration of the provision by operation of law three years after its effective date.
Preliminary Recommendation:Approve the resolution to initiate the Planning Code amendments and enable consideration of approval of the Ordinance on or after September 22, 2016.
