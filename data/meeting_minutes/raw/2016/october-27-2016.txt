Commissioner Richards:
I just wanted, I -- we keeping talking about this every week about the future of cars and it's relation -- relationship to parking, sorry -- and I noticed in The Chronicle Business Section yesterday, there was a 120 mile long beer run with 70 tons of beer in Imperial County, where the driver or the truck was sleeping in the cab, was sitting in the cab and the truck went by itself. I think this is an indication of what is going on in the world today, it is going to have an impact on parking, car ownership and traffic, so it is interesting thing, we should look at this when look forward, when we talk about parking and cars and all of that, another example that was in the press yesterday.

9.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
I just want to make a couple of comments about the Transportation Demand Management Program, TDM Program. If you recall, of course, you all voted unanimously voted to support this legislation in August and you adopted the program standards and we had anticipated, I think as you know that that legislation would have moved forward by now, it is not, and the hearings has not been scheduled at the Land Use and Transportation Committee and we don't think that will be scheduled for a couple of more weeks. So, the effective date of the ordinance is actually later that we had originally hoped. Last week you requested the project sponsor on 1001 Van Ness to meet those standards informally and that project sponsor agreed to do so. So, I wanted to inform you, given the importance of the policy and your support of that program and the direction you gave that project sponsor last week as well as, how these policies are supported in the General Plan and Planning Code, that I've asked the staff to look at the TDM measures and to work with the project sponsors to best meet those standards even if they're not technically required yet and to use the existing policies that you put forward or are in the General Plan or Planning Code to support the measures in the TDM ordinances. It maybe that these projects can' t meet the specific count, if you will, the point system but they can – we believe we can work with them to kind get as close as possible to meeting those standards that are in the TDM ordinance, so I just wanted to give you an update on that program. Thank you.
10.Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission
Land Use Committee:
·160820 Planning Code-Landmark Designation-1345 Ocean Avenue aka Ingleside Presbyterian Church and the Great Cloud of Witnesses. Sponsor: Yee. Staff: Parks/Frye. Item 1
Ordinance recommending approval the landmark designation of 1345 Ocean Avenue (aka Ingleside Presbyterian Church & The Great Cloud of Witnesses) Assessor’s Block No. 6942, Lot No. 050.
Designed by master local architect Joseph Leonard in 1923, the Ingleside Presbyterian Church is architecturally significant for its monumental neoclassical style architecture. Leonard is best known for his residential developments including Ingleside Terraces and Jordan Park, the church is a rare ecclesiastical example of Leonard’s work and of this style in the city.
The building is also significant for its interior mural-collage entitled The Great Cloud of Witnesses. The mural collage was started by Reverend Roland Gordon in 1980, when he pasted on image of his hero Muhammad Ali to the wall of the church’s gym. He intended to inspire the youth of the area, saying that, “they may not read their Black history books, but they’ll read the walls.” Over the past thirty seven years, Reverend Gordon’s artwork has grown to cover the entire gymnasium, and many other rooms in the church. It is comprised of various media, primarily newspaper and magazine clippings, and found objects and it includes rooms dedicated to church history; the church family; and famous entertainers, performers, and politicians. It stands as the largest and most imaginatively executed Folk Artists Environment dedicated to African American history and role models in the country.
The Historic Preservation Commission initiated designation in May 4, 2016.And on June 1 the HPC conducted a site visit and then unanimously voted to recommended designation based on the building’s distinctive Modern architecture and as the work of a master architect.
At Land Use there was one speaker that spoke in support Mike Buhler, executive Director of San Francisco Heritage, who supported and co-authored the legislation The Committee forwarded the Ordinance with a recommendation of approval to the Full BOS.
·150866 Planning Code-Landmark Designation Amendment-140 Maiden Lane (aka VC Morris Gift Shop). Sponsor: Peskin. Staff: Ferguson/Fry. Item 2
On February 5, 1975, Ordinance No. 22-75 designated 140 Maiden Lane (aka V. C. Morris Gift Shop), Assessor’s Block No. 0309, Lot 019, as Landmark No. 72.That Ordinance required “that the said Landmark should be preserved generally in all of its particular exterior features,” but did not list all the character-defining features to be preserved in any amount of detail.Moreover, it did not include any of the interior character-defining features as part of the Landmark Designation.
Wright’s design for the V. C. Morris Gift Shop breaks the rules of conventional department store design. Instead of a visually open storefront and open floor plan, the building’s solid brick façade with narrow arched tunnel entrance gives no indication of the interior’s double-height, mezzanine-ringed, top-lit circular interior space with distinct sales areas. It is the first building to be constructed using what became his favorite structural shape, the spiral, which dominated his work throughout his final years. The façade of the V. C. Morris Gift Shop was also the first time Wright incorporated the Romanesque arch in five decades, a design motif which he had often used in his early work.
Frank Lloyd Wright is by far the most well‐known and influential American architect.Although Wright produced several designs for other buildings in San Francisco, the V. C. Morris Gift Shop is the only one that was realized. The V. C. Morris Gift Shop is also significant as a rare extant Modern building designed by the master architect.
The Historic Preservation Commission initiated designation in May 4, 2016. On June 1, 2015, the HPC conducted a site visit and then unanimously voted to recommended designation based on the building’s distinctive Modern architecture and as the work of a master architect. At Land Use there was one speaker that spoke in support. Paul Turner, author of Frank Lloyd Wright and San Francisco, spoke in support of amending the landmark designation to include the interior. The Committee forwarded the Ordinance with a recommendation of approval to the Full BOS.
·160424 and 160553 Planning Codes - General Advertising & Sign Penalties. Sponsor: Peskin. Staff: D. Sanchez. Item 3 & 4.
At Monday’s Land Use Committee hearing, the committee heard Supervisor Peskin’s two sign ordinances. Together these ordinances will: strengthen the General Advertising sign controls, including the enforcement penalties; align the City’s sign Controls with the 1st Amendment’s protection of noncommercial speech; and improve other sign controls, including better organization and removal of redundant language.
This Commission considered both Ordinances on September 15, 2016, and recommended support of both ordinances with three minor modifications, which included:
1.Eliminating the reference to the Candlestick Park Area Special Sign District in the Code and Zoning Map.
2.Amending the Definition of Wind Sign to Include Signs with only one banner; and
3.Amending the Definition of Historic Sign.
Since the Planning Commission hearing, Supervisor Peskin amended the Ordinance to incorporate your requested modifications. The Committee hearing was short with one speaker in support.The Committee forwarded both Ordinances with a recommendation of approval to the Full BOS.
·160893 Hearing – Administrative, Public Works, Police Codes-Places for People Program. Sponsor: Wiener. Staff: Abad/Hrushowy. Item 6.
An Ordinance for Places for People, which will codify a framework for all of the short-term ('temporary') community-driven and sponsored public space projects such as parklets, pedestrian plazas, and urban prototypes was also heard this week at Land Use.The development of the ordinance was led by the Planning Department through Pavement to Parks in partnership with Public Works, Municipal Transportation Agency, Department of Real Estate, and the Entertainment Commission. The Ordinance was sponsored by Supervisor Wiener and proposes modifications to Administrative, Public Works, and Police Codes that will:
1.Lower process and resource barriers to increase public participation in the Program;
2.Facilitate greater equity (geographic distribution) of Projects in all neighborhoods, especially those that have fewer resources;
3.Enable more activation that is frequent, diverse, and free to the public;
4.Streamline interagency permitting and agency review processes by establishing a clear and transparent sequence of review, approval and adjudication of appeals by the pertinent City agencies;
5.Create self-financing opportunities to better support long-term stewardship of community-sponsored Places; and,
6.Define clear parameters for operations, permit terms, and enforcement.
The ordinance officially codifies the Planning Department's historic role in coordinating and leading the interagency Pavement to Parks and related programs. The Planning Commission heard an Informational Presentation on the forthcoming legislation in April 2016.At that time, the Commission gave support of the proposed legislation.
At the Land Use Committee Supervisor Wiener introduced some minor amendments such as clarifying the relationship of the new Administrative and Public Works Code sections to the Transportation Code and the role of Planning, Public Works, and the MTA in proposal review, project development and approval, that were adopted during Committee. The Committee hearing was attended by over a dozen individuals representing citywide and neighborhood organizations speaking in support of the legislation.The Committee forwarded the Ordinances with a recommendation of approval to the Full BOS.
Supervisor Wiener will also introduce a separate, trailing piece of legislation pertaining specifically to permit fees.The Departments would like to develop a separate fee structure that lowers costs for project sponsors such as nonprofits and neighborhood groups.

RESIDENTIAL EXPANSION THRESHOLD-Informational Presentationon the Department’s proposal to eliminate tantamount to demolition controls with a new “residential expansion review.” This threshold would identify proposed residential projects with policy issues which would necessitate review by the Planning Commission. For more information, please visit our website athttp://sf-planning.org/residential-expansion-threshold.
Preliminary Recommendation:  None - Informational
SPEAKERS:= Liz Watty – Staff Introduction
= Menaka Mohan – Staff Report
= Georgia Schuttish – Recommendations
“If any of all sections of the front or rear façade or wall of a structure are proposed for removal, then the project is considered Tantamount to a Demolition and must have a Conditional Use Authorization hearing.However, if a project is determined during Intake and Design Review to remove any or all sections of only the rear façade or wall of the structure for only a horizontal addition, and this horizontal addition does not exceed the rear yard requirements under Sections 134 and 136 of the Planning Code, this project will not be considered Tantamount to a Demolition, but an alteration.If a vertical addition is proposed that adds square footage, a project will be considered Tantamount to a Demolition and a CUA hearing will be required.A roof deck is considered a vertical addition.Skylights or clerestory will not trigger a CUA hearing.If any portion of the front façade is altered at any time during the construction of a project, other than replacement windows per the Planning and Building Code, a project would be considered Tantamount to a Demolition and would be subject to penalties under the Planning Code and Building Code.If a Project Sponsor wishes to add only a garage to a structure that does not currently have a garage, such an addition couldbe considered under the Soft Story Program and the ADU provision or a Project Sponsor may seek a Variance from the Zoning Administrator.If a Project Sponsor needs to repair a front or rear façade due to deteriorating conditions, a special Building Permit must be applied for an will be issue.This special Building Permit would require scrutiny from both the Building Department and the Enforcement Division of the Planning Department at the time of application.”

RE 09-22-2016 RESIDENTIAL EXPANSION THRESHOLD (RET) DOCUMENT
& TANTAMOUNT TO DEMOLITION (TTD)
DOCUMENT STATES PURPOSES IN SECTION 317 TO:
1. PREVENT REDUCTION OF HOUSING THAT WAS MORE AFFORDABLE
2. “CATCH” PROJECTS THAT AVOID DBI’S DEFINITION OF “DEMOLITION”*,
RESULT IN HOMES NOT AFFORDABLE DUE TO REMOVAL OF EXISTING HOUSING
PLANNING’S PROPOSALS INCLUDE:
1. THRESHOLD TRIGGER AT 3,000 GSF PER UNIT
2. PERCENTAGE OF LOT SIZES IN SUPERVISOR’S DISTRICT
3. PERCENTAGE OF ORIGINAL SINGLE FAMILY HOME GSF BEING APPLIED TO RH-2 BUILDINGS
WHAT DEFINITION OF “UNIT” ARE WE USING?
HOW MANY OF THE 3,000 SQ. FT+ UNITS DOES THE CITY HAVE ALREADY?
ABOVE IDEAS DON’T FIT INTO CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS
THIS DOES NOT STREAMLINE ANY PROCESS, DOES NOT MAKE IT CLEAR TO ARCHITECTS & NEIGHBORS WHAT EXACTLY WILL BE OK.
ADDITIONALLY, “RET” CHANGE / ELIMINATION OF “TTD” WOULD NOT SOLVE AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM.
-Anastasia Yovanopolous – Recommendations
Re: Residential Expansion Threshold
The purpose of establishing demolition controls was to address affordability, and the General Plan policy to retain existing sound housing.
The RET proposal almost doubles dwelling unit sizes.Resulting units become expensive, by virtue of size and new construction.The preservation of existing sound housing stock and maintain its’ affordability is lost.
Let’s use the average size of homes at the block level, plus a little more as threshold, in lieu of a fixed threshold.Assessor’s records can be used to arrive at the average size of homes where the project is proposed.We can determine the “little bit more” number, jointly.
This approach ensures new projects will conform to mass and scale at the block level.Expansion will be gradual, no exponential.

FILIPINO CULTURAL HERITAGE DISTRICT-Informational Presentationby Planning Department staff regarding the Filipino Cultural Heritage District, also known as SoMa Pilipinas. In April 2016, the Board of Supervisors created the cultural heritage district to contribute to the sustainability, cultural visibility, vibrancy and economic opportunity for Filipinos and Filipino-Americans in the South of Market (SoMa) neighborhood (Resolution No. 119-16, File No. 151109).

870-872 UNION STREET- north side of Union Street, between Taylor and Mason Streets, Lots 020, 085-087 in Assessor’s Block 0100 (District 3) - Request forVariancefrom the Zoning Administrator for “Rear Yard” (Section 134); “Open Space” (Section135); and “Dwelling Unit Exposure” (Section 140).The subject lot is a through lot with one existing residential structure at the front (fronting Union Street), containing 3 dwelling units. The project proposes a vertical and horizontal addition to said front structure (adding a fourth floor), and construction a new, 4-story residential structure in the rear of the lot (fronting Aladdin Terrace), containing 1 dwelling unit. Section 134 of the Planning Code requires a minimum rear yard of approximately 32’-3/16” for the subject property. Because the subject lot is a through lot, the required rear yard shall be located in the central portion of the lot, between the two structures on such lot. The project proposes a new structure in the rear of the lot (fronting Aladdin Terrace) that would encroach into the required rear yard by approximately 12’-3/16”; therefore the project requires a variance. Section 135 of the Planning Code requires useable open space be provided for each dwelling unit according to standards set forth in the Code. Two of the four units (Units #1 and #2 in the front structure) do not provide useable open space meeting the requirements of the Code; therefore the project requires a variance. Section 140 of the Planning Code requires units to face directly on an open area as defined by Code. Two of the four units (Unit #1 in the front structure, and Unit #4 in the rear structure) do not face directly on an open area as defined by Code; therefore the project requires a variance. The Project Site is located within a RM-1 (Residential-Mixed, Low Density) Zoning District and 40-X Height and Bulk District.
