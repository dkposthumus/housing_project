AYES:Fong, Richards, Antonini, Johnson, Moore, Wu
ABSENT:Hillis
9.Commission Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements.Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary:
Commissioner Antonini, I apologize you're correct the number is item 12 I apologize, under Department’s matters
Commissioner Antonini:
Change that back to 12, I assume that is noted in the approval of continuance.
Commissioner Fong:
Jonas, I have one question about the calendar, we have -- can you remind me June 30th as a cancelled meeting date? Can you remind me the reason for that?
Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary:
June 30this cancelled procedurally as it is the 5th Thursday of June.
Commissioner Fong:
Okay, very good. Thank you.
Commissioner Richards:
A couple of quick things, first there was an article in this morning’s Pittsburgh Post-Gazette by Associated Press, actually Puig Research Center in UCLA, they do a lot of different types of surveys around technology and housing and demographics. They're showing that in most metropolitan areas in the U.S., all but two, the amount of middle class people earning in between 140 and 60% of the local AMI has been shrinking dramatically. In fact, 79 metropolitan areas are showing a majority of upper income folks versus only 37 in the year 2000. So, the issue we're sitting here in this city is being pretty much replicated in most of U.S. cities, save about two. Secondly, was a little bit disappointed that the Eastern Neighborhoods CAC was not able to get a quorum last night. I understood that on the agenda they were going to vote to clear, to move forward with the implementation monitoring report, will have to do that next month, so I think that puts everything off by an additional month. I'm disappointed to hear that. Thank you.
Commissioner Moore:
In the New Yorker there is an article called Dorm Life Forever and it speaks about a new form of housing and without going into detail, I'll copy you in all of it. It is definitely an eye opener. It’s a new form of collective housing which minimizes any kind of private space, but creates everything around a communal concept for adults. I’ll forward to you.
Commissioner Antonini:
In regards to our calendar, I also noticed that we're not in session on the 26thof May as well as the 30thof June and I would propose that one of those dates be added back in that we are scheduling items into August now and so, I think it’s not fair to everyone involved in projects that we've had to calendar them so far so far ahead, so perhaps June date might be more practical, it may have a timing problem with the 26 of May, so I want to put that out there for the other Commissioners to consider.
Commissioner Moore:
Supporting that comment, I had the public talk to me about why DRs when we have very full calendars during the normal hours are always last? Which puts particularly elderly or people with children will sit here all day, somewhere at a disadvantage to actively participate in the discussions together with the fact, that we're often very tired when it reaches 8, or 9 or 10 o’clock hour.I’d like to float that as an idea to spread-out the count particularly, because we do have large projects and it is really dragging on quietly for all of us.
Commissioner Johnson:
Thank you, seeing that we're only a couple of weeks out from the May 26thdate, I might propose that that we would consider putting the June 30thdate back on there, in case we want to rejigger June calendar and that might make things a little bit easier. At this point, if we put May 26, it’s a little – you know, a little short notice for the Commissioners and others, and the other thing I'll definitely supported Commissioner Moore's comments about DRs. Potentially one thing we might consider to light our load is take June DRs make them all on the 30th, so that we just have one meeting, so we can hear other large projects in other hearings and have June 30th be a DR hearing.[Laughter] That's why Commissioner Wu says it's fine.
Commissioner Richards:
I think the May 26th is too early to add back honestly. I would support doing the June 30th meeting if it is for DRs only, and we may consider that periodically in the future do, just do DR meetings.
Commissioner Antonini:
I'm, of course, supportive of adding back June 30th, and I can historically, there was a period of time probably 12 years ago and the same issue came up, for a short period of time one week we put DRs first, and the next week we put CUs first, and kind of flip flop them so interspersing them maybe is not as rigid as that proposal was, but maybe putting some of the DRs early on the calendar on occasion might you know, be a little fairer to these involved in DRs.
Commissioner Moore:
This is a comment to the Director, the Department is doing a lot of informational presentations, some of them quite important and requiring time and thought for comment, I will say, that we sometimes are getting a little bit too overloaded and not spending enough time on really letting the discussion mature. So if there are particular items, which could be push to a later date or group them together with some DRs that would be appreciated as well.
Commissioner Antonini:
So do we need to vote to add back the 30thor can it be just back?
Jonas Ionin, Commission Secretary:
We'll certainly need to make a motion and vote the June 30thhearing date back on your schedule.
Commissioner Antonini:
I would so move.
Jonas Ionin, Commission Secretary:
Just for clarity sake, is this only for DRs or for any cases? Because I heard Commissioner Richards interested only in DRs.
Commissioner Richards:
I’d love it to be just for DRs.
Jonas Ionin, Commission Secretary:
I think, it might be a little more flexible.
Commissioner Richards:
Mostly, DRs.
Jonas Ionin, Commission Secretary:
That’s fine.
Commissioner Antonini:
My motion would allow, because one of the reasons adding back something that is being continued, being bumped to August to September could be fit into that day, so my motionwould be more flexible.
Commissioner Richards:
Second.
Commissioner Moore:
I think as the Director has anything in the back pocket, which may really be well presented in conjunction with that, I’d like to have that informational and DR depending on how many DRs we have.
Commissioner Richards:
I think Commissioner Antonini is on to something, when he said, potentially things that we continued way out to August, because we just have no room, we might be able to accelerate one of those on the June 30th calendar.
Director Rahaim:
That will all depend on noticing, because some things require 30 day notice and so we need to work with staff on that.
Jonas Ionin, Commissioner Secretary:
June 30th works quite well with noticing. I will only note that as the person that manages or tries to manage your schedule, it is easier said than done, to put things cleanly on your schedule because there are requests from Supervisors, there are requests from staff and legislative items that require your attention in a timely fashion. So, I would you all to take that into consideration.
Commissioner Fong:
I'll take the opportunity to thank you Jonas every week and every month, to juggle to try to accommodate everyone, not just the Commissioners schedule.
Jonas Ionin, Commissioner Secretary:
Thank you, I appreciate that.

10.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
One announcement today, in light of – I am sure all you've heard the City Attorney filing suit on the Academy of Art. I just wanted to assure you, that we have – we are moving forward with the environmental impact report. It is on schedule. We have a commitment from the Academy and their attorneys to move forward and to continue to complete that environmental impact report by July 1st, which is the date that we all have been working toward, and that will continue to happen. Obviously, the lawsuit will play out, as it does, but I want to make sure you knew that we have that commitment to complete the work, so allow us to keep moving forward with your actions in the future and we are still scheduled for an informational hearing next week on the Academy, where we will present our preliminary thoughts in terms of recommendations on specific sites in the Academy’s portfolio, but we are still on schedule as we have been previously. Thank you.

BOARD OF APPEALS:
The Board of Appeals met last night. There was only one item maybe of interest, 1095 Market Street. There was a Letter of Determination that I issued. This is a project that had been before the Commission twice, and 2010 approval to convert from office building to hotel extension of that authorization in 2013. After the most recent extension, they submitted the building permit for the project. There were some changes in the configuration of the hotel, but this is adaptive reuse of the existing historic building. There were no changes in the size of the building or any other elements of it. We found to be in conformance with the Commission’s decision. The building permit was issued last year and work is underway. There was an appeal that was filed on the issuance of the permit, but one could not be heard because it was issued pursuant to a Conditional Use Authorization, so it said the appellant sought a Letter of Determination about the conformity with your decision and which I found in to be in conformance and the Board of Appeals upheld that decision last night. I'm available for any questions you may have.

The project sponsor proposes to construct two new buildings on-site. The “16th Street Building" at 901 16th Street would consist of a new six-story, 68-foot tall (excluding rooftop projections of up to 82 feet), approximately 402,943 gross square foot (gsf) residential mixed-use building with 260 dwelling units and 20,318 gsf of retail on the northern lot.
