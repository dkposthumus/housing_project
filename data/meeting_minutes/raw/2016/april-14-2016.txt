·Future Meetings/Agendas.At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Antonini:
First of all, congratulations to the Warriors on setting the NBA record last night. The other thing I’d like to ask the staff is about we had a hearing last week on PDR and there's a series of e-mails back and forth and have been going through the entire Eastern Neighborhoods process, I think it would be really helpful, if we have a brief presentation from staff showing maps that delineate the square footage that is reserved for only PDR and where it is on the map, and also the square footage delineated from PDR2, which is not the core PDR but less intense PDR, which generally surrounds the area where the core PDR is and also realizing that before that was 1 M and now has a different zone that protects it, and then basically talk a little bit about the where the UMU where anticipated loss of PDR would take place, and how much square footage has been taken out of PDR, and how much is anticipated, and how much could possibly happen, and is it still within the limits that we have assigned, because we have a total amount that we anticipate to be converted from PDR to other uses. So, it would be good if we have this thing kind of established ahead of time, and it might make it a little easier when we have discussions on particular projects, because we already have some delineation as to what areas are anticipated for conversion to housing or office or other uses where PDR would be allowed and not allowed and be a little easier for the Commission I think. Thank you.
D.DEPARTMENT MATTERS
6.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Actually, my announcement was related to Commissioner Antonini's comments, we would be happy to do the report, we actually have in your advance calendar on June 23rdthere is the Eastern Neighborhoods Monitoring Report that staff is working on now, so we would be happy to make that part of that report as well, and also I wanted to reference to some recent e-mails, I also want reiterate my comment and I made this comment to some of the folks in the Mission District that we’re working with, that I would be happy to have a discussion about the potential changes to UMU zoning, it has come up several times. If we need to look up tweaking UMU zoning with respect to PDR uses, I think it is time to do that. I am happy to have that discussion. I am happy to talk about what those changes need to be with respect to PDR uses within the UMU zone. Thank you, that concludes my remarks.
7.Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission
LAND USE COMMITTEE:
•160188 General Plan Amendment - Downtown Area Plan Map 5 - Portions of Transbay Redevelopment Plan Blocks 1 and 2. Sponsor: Planning Commission. Staff: Switzky/Haddadan.
At Land Use this week, the Committee heard a clean-up ordinance that would amend the Downtown Plan height map to add reference to the Transbay Redevelopment Plan. The Planning Commission heard this item on February 25 of this year and recommended approval.
You may recall from last week that this item was continued one week due to concerns Supervisor Peskin had about the transmittal of an unrelated ordinance, the General Plan Amendment for the Affordable Housing Bonus Program. Both items were heard on Feb 25. To address the Supervisor’s concerns, the Planning Department did transmit the AHBP General Plan amendment last Friday.
At this week’s hearing, there was no comment from the Committee and the item was forwarded to the Full Board with a positive recommendation.
FULL BOARD:
•150732 Building, Administrative Codes - Mandatory Disability Access Improvements; Building Owner’s Notice to Tenant; Administrative Fee.Sponsor: Tang. Staff: Not Staffed.
PASSED Second Read
•151164 Planning Code - Landmark Designation - 171 San Marcos Avenue (aka Cowell House).Sponsors: Yee, Peskin. Staff: Ferguson.

Adopted
•160215 Hearing - Redevelopment Plan Amendment - Transbay Redevelopment Project Area - Zone One. Hearing, Item 20
•160150 Redevelopment Plan Amendment - Transbay Redevelopment Project Area - Zone One. Sponsor: Mayor, Kim. First Read, Item 21
Also this week, the Full Board sat as a committee of the whole to hear a proposed Ordinance that would approve an amendment to the Redevelopment Plan for the Transbay Redevelopment Project Area. The amendment would increase the maximum height limit from 300 feet to 400 feet on Block 1 within Zone One of the Transbay Redevelopment Project Area. As I’m sure the Commission is aware, this proposal relates to the Studio Gang-designed corkscrewing high-rise at 160 Folsom Street, which is seeking a map amendment so that it can build ten stories higher than the permitted zoning, which will accommodate more affordable housing. It’s also related to the General Plan Amendment that was heard at Land Use this week.
At the hearing, Supervisor Kim provided opening remarks related to the project and representatives from OCII provided an overview of the project and responded to questions raised throughout the discussion. During public comment, approximate 26 people representing various neighborhood groups and labor unions spoke in favor of the proposed ordinance, while approximately 6 people, primarily representing the organization Save Rincon Park, spoke in opposition. After the hearing was closed, Supervisor Kim, seconded by Supervisor Campos, moved that this Ordinance be continued one week so that OCII could respond in writing to the concerns raised by those opposed to the project during the hearing.
•General Plan Amendment - Downtown Area Plan Map 5 - Portions of Transbay Redevelopment Plan Blocks 1 and 2. Sponsor: Planning Commission. Staff: Switzky/Haddadan.
And lastly, the Board passed on first read the related General Plan Amendment that was heard at Land Use this week.
