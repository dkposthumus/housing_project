Specifically, the Commission will consider the following items and may take action on or afterFebruary 15, 2007.
Together, these Commission actions are intended to implement the Market and Octavia Plan.  In addition, an historic survey is currently being done of the project area; property owners considering constructing  or altering a building in this area should consult with Planning Department staff to determine  the historic resource status of their property.  Property owners and interested parties are advised that height limits and other controls do not provide unqualified rights to development, but rather, proscribe the maximum potential building envelope that may be permitted; proposed buildings may not reach the maximum permitted building height/envelope.   The Commission may also consider establishing interim procedures to guide the review of plans to construct new structures and alter existing structures to  protect  potentially eligible historic resources in the Plan Area prior to conclusion of an historic resources survey.
Members of the public may review a copy of the proposed amendments at the San Francisco Planning Department office at 1660 Mission Street 5th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94103, at the Public Library (the Main Library 100 Larkin St., and Harvey Milk branch library, 1 Jose Sarria Ct. (near16th & Market Sts.).  An electronic copy of the proposed amendments and actions is available athttp://marketoctavia.betterneighborhoods.org.
As part of Case No. 2003.0347T, the proposed Planning Code text amendment would revise Planning Code controls, including controls for land use, height and bulk, building design, loading, parking and establish new fees.  The proposed amendments are described more fully below:
Establishment of Three Zoning Districts in the Plan Area
The Transit-Oriented Residential Use District (RTO) will replace most of the RH and RM districts zoning north and south of the Market Street corridor, extending north to Turk Street, west to Noe and Scott Streets, and South to Sixteenth Street. The proposed RTO district will encourage moderate-density, multi-family, and residential infill. Because of the availability of transit service, proximity of retail and services within walking distance, and limitation on permitted parking the RTO permits the construction of some housing without accessory parking. Parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing within buildings in keeping with neighborhood scale. Proposed heights in Residential Transit Oriented (RTO) Districts and RH districts primarily remain 40 and 50 feet as currently classified; in some RTO areas, permitted heights will change from 50, 80 and 105 feet to 40 and 50 feet.
A Neighborhood Commercial Transit District (NCT) will overlay the Hayes-Gough Neighborhood Commercial District and portions of the Upper Market and Valencia Neighborhood Commercial Districts within the Market and Octavia neighborhood.  In named NCT and NC-1 (T) districts, parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing above ground-floor retail uses. These districts will largely keep the existing specific use-size controls. They include current Neighborhood Commercial Districts (Hayes-Gough, portions of the Upper Market, Valencia) and several parcels currently zoned NC-1.
The Van Ness and Market Downtown Residential Special Use District (VNMDR-SUD) will permit the development of a transit-oriented, high-density, mixed-use neighborhood around the intersections of Van Ness Avenue and Market Street and South Van Ness Avenue and Mission Street.  This SUD will overlay existing C-3-G districts and existing C-M districts will be rezoned to C-3-G with this new VNMDR-SUD. Parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing in buildings with mixed-used podiums and some residential towers at two key intersections: Market Street and Van Ness Avenue and Mission Street and South Van Ness Avenue. Proposed heights in the Van Ness and Market Downtown Residential Use District (VNMDR-SUD) will change from 120, 130, 150, 160, 200 and 320 feet to 85, 120, 200, 320 and 400 feet; towers will be permitted over a podium of 85 or 120 feet; the highest towers will be permitted in the vicinity of the Market Street/Van Ness Avenue intersections.
In the Transit-Oriented Neighborhood Commercial Use Districts (NCT), height districts will change from 50, 80 and 105 feet to primarily 55, 65 and 85 feet; these districts will be located in SoMa West and along Market Street. The NCT district will largely replace C-M and NC-3 districts. In the NCT district, parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing above ground-floor retail uses. These districts will largely keep the existing specific use-size controls in place in the NC-3 district. Some heights on some parcels near Brady Street will change from 105 and 60 feet to 40 feet and 85 feet on parcels surrounding a proposed public open space.
Establishment of New Fees in the Plan Area
In order to fund the community improvements identified in the Plan, the Program document proposes to establish a Development Impact Fee, requiring the growth that generates the demand for additional infrastructure and services to provide some of the revenue required to fund the improvements.  The proposal establishes a development impact fee on new residential and commercial development in the Plan Area.  The fee proposal is $10.00 per square foot of residential development, and $4.00 per square foot of commercial development.
To encourage the provision of necessary and desirable public infrastructure improvements and also in order to mitigate the impacts of this increased localized density, the Department has established the Van Ness and Market Neighborhood Infrastructure Fund. Developers may provide in-kind public improvements (such as open space or streetscape improvements) or proportional in-lieu contributions to this fund that will allow the city to develop these facilities. The Department estimates that no more than 6 potential development sites would benefit from participating in the program. The Department has set the value of the additional FAR at par with the current market value of historic TDR credits ($15 per square foot).

SPEAKERS:
I do not see small business fitting in the plan.Keep us in mind for future rezoning.
Urge the commission to take the draft community improvement program back and make some fundamental changes.
Our buildings are small and the Market-Octavia Plan would alter the neighborhood character.
-Hold off on any demolitions until we have the historic survey.
-Suggested parking management from the city.
-Consider one-to-one parking in the Dolores neighborhood.
The size, height and density plan proposed for Market and Buchanan does not fit the neighborhood.
Urged the Commission to invite the Department of Emergency Services of San Francisco to share the consequences of large volume of construction in the next 20 to 25 years
Gideon Kramer
-Opposes big construction on Dolores and 14 Streets for being out of character
-Consider one-to-one parking on any new construction along Market and Dolores Street.
Scott Kuby
-UC extension is including 450 housing units. This plan would add so much density on Buchanan and Market Street.
-My concerns are health because of a former gas station, shopping, and a commuting already crowded.
Craig O'connor
Urge not to build at 1998 Market Street.It will highly impact the neighborhood.
Dennis Richards
-I support no density limit on Market Street but limit inner streets.
-We support no density limit on inner blocks if it provides permanent affordable housing for underserved populations and has conditional use.
Chris Peterson
Rufino DeLeon Jr.
SOMA/West is a relatively new neighborhood. We would like to get involved with this plan.
Lynne Creighhton
-Modernization should happen in other parts of the city but not in historic neighborhoods.
-People are fearful of changes.They come here to demand and not compromise themselves.
-Adopt the project.
Robin Levitt
Support the plan the way it is with high density and low parking.
-The Plan process has been open, democratic and transparent.
-Adopt the plan to have a better San Francisco.
The Plan is great because of density.The ability to have affordable housing is much more important than cars.
-This plan includes incredible density without improvement of public transportation.
-Height limits should be different whether being on the North or South side of a street.Construction proposals on Buchanan and Market are too big for the character of the neighborhood.
-Requested to hold this Plan until all these details are worked out.
-Urged to adopt the Plan.It targets affordable housing by lowering parking and increasing density.
-The Planning Department has done good work and has tried to responsive to public needs.
-Developers only care about concrete and not affordable housing.
-Challenged the Commission to carefully read the proposal of this plan and amend it to truly do something for Market-Octavia.
-Thanked staff and the Commission for the work and the respect you gave to the public.
-This plan allows choices on affordability, transit, density and parking.
-We will work with the Commission and follow up promises made on this plan.
-Many people have participated in this plan.
-This process is going to help neighborhoods with housing, retails and certainty with Zoning and Planning Codes.
