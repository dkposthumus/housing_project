B.COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS(Tape IA)
6.Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Antonini
-I have some questions regarding springing conditions that came up at last week's hearing.
-These are comments that I heard from the public and I think it is worth a discussion of them.
-Is it legal to impose conditions without a nexus study? How are the fees to be used?
-It is an important issue and the public wants to know.
-I also would like a list of projects that have had springing conditions in the past.
-I wonder if they have been applied to residential developments.
-About additional below market rate units:Generally they come in return for height and density bonuses.
-This is the first time I remember changes being made about below market rate as they applied to 736 Valencia Street and 3400 Cesar Chavez.
-I would like to know how or why this applied to those projects.
-Lastly a young couple--patients of mine--illustrates the situation in the city regarding housing.
-Being first time homebuyers, they are moving to Concord even thought they want to stay in San Francisco.
-The only choice they found in the city was a 1 bedroom in the $500,000 dollars range versus in Concord in the $300,000 dollars range for a 2 bedroom home.
-My comments are based on studies showing that we are building almost no housing in the 60 to 80 percentile for people in San Francisco.
-We may speak more about this situation on the Eastern Neighborhood presentation.
-I am hoping we can come up with a formula and be able to include different inclusionary systems for builders to include 80 to 140 percentile.
-I called some researchers for data to compare costs in other cities regarding fees and materials.
-We should know where those areas are and if we could do something in our process to minimize cost in order to increase affordability on projects.
Commissioner Alexander
-I would like to remind Commissioner Antonini that we agreed last week to not impose springing conditions.
Commissioner W. Lee
-I have a question on mitigation fees: How do we justify $13 a square foot for housing and $4 a square foot for commercial?
-Last week on one of the projects, that amount came out of nowhere and was approved voluntarily by the Project Sponsor.
-Rincon Hill was approved for $23 a square foot and it appears to work.
-Bayview has a different fee of dollars and with high-rises would benefit to provide funding to off set the affordable housing.
-I would like staff to provide to us an analysis for a formula on community benefit fees.
-The construction for downtown with the Market and Octavia Plan with the high-rises the fee should be higher.
-Now, we are going into the Eastern Neighborhood and I do not know what model we used to justify these fees.
-I think staff has to come back within a month and give us directions on what is a fair fee and if they could respond as to when they can provide that information.
Commissioner Alexander
-Other Commissioners have to conquer on that request for staff to generate it.
-What we did last week was something that we reasonable for the project to move forward.
-It is the full intention of staff to go back and put together what the actual cost would be until the new zoning comes out.
-Developers have the choice to move forward or wait until the new zoning and fees come out.
Commissioner Antonini
-I support that request.It is definitely an important subject.
Dean Macris, Director of Planning
-It was a voluntary matter and if the Commission would like to have further discussion about fees, we could certainly do that.
-It does need further analysis and we are working on that.
-It is a very important subject to discuss.
-Mr. President could instruct what he would like us to do -- whether to schedule time to discuss or to produce a report.
Commissioner W. Lee
-We had two projects coming up and charged $13 a square foot for community benefits.
-Commercial spaces are charged $4 a square foot and I wonder why not charge the reverse, $13 for commercial and $4 for housing?
-Some other questions that I have are the allocation of that money.Where it goes and if we could allocate it for affordable housing?
Commissioner Alexander
-There is specification on the money collected for public benefit to be used on parks, street improvements and sidewalks.
Commissioner Olague
-I am happy with the respond from staff about intent to establish some controls for Eastern Neighborhood.
-The Mission Neighborhood has been neglected because of the absence of permanent controls.
-It is important to finalize and get to a conclusion of a process that has taken so long.

-We have not seen information on the visual impact on Ms. Yamagushi who is the property owner to the north of this project.
-Sponsor wants to maximize their space no matter what the impacts are on their neighbors.
-We have not received any phone calls for a meeting from the engineer to respond to concerns.
James Zhao, Representing Adjacent Neighbor
-I have reviewed the revised plans produced by the project architect and have found that the main issue still has not been addressed.
-It would impact, impair and weaken the structure foundation system supporting my client's house adjacent to the subject property.
-Two piers along property line support six houses and construction needs to be away from those piers.
Mildred Yamagushi
Louise Victor

-Contacts were not made from Project Sponsor until plans were submitted.
Leon
Robert Colyer, Project Architect

Elizabeth Tippin, Project Sponsor Representative
-I just want to focus my comments on precedence in the area.
-The building at 1887 Funston Avenue is a large vertical mass that actually goes all the way out to a 30 percent set back.
-1923 and 1927 Funston properties have an existing deck that is approximately 3 to 4 feet away from the 30 percent set back line.

EASTERN NEIGHBORHOODS PROGRAM- The Eastern Neighborhoods Program encompasses the Mission, Central Waterfront, East SoMa and Showplace Square.Bayview Hunters Point is undergoing a separate process, but shares some issues with the other neighborhoods.Staff will present a progress report on the Program, including a proposed schedule for completing the Eastern Neighborhoods area plans and rezoning, an update on proposals for affordable housing and public benefits and an overview of the basic land use proposals for the industrial lands.This progress report is the first of a series on the Eastern Neighborhoods that staff expects to present to the Planning Commission over the next several months.
Preliminary Recommendation:Informational Item, no action requested.
SPEAKERS
Doug Shoemaker, Major's Office of Housing
-In the Eastern Neighborhoods, the median household income tend to be lower than the rest of the City.
-The average household size is larger.
-We have existing city-financed housing between 600 to 1,200; and inclusionary housing between 950 to 1,350.
-Total affordable housing is 1,500 to 2,500 in the Eastern Neighborhood serving low, extreme-low, and medium income families.
-This is absolutely an average and it is based on different types of opportunities when they represented themselves.
-According to the housing inventory that Planning Department publishes on a regular basis, 30 percent of housing created in the city for the last 5 years is affordable.
1)- Inclusionary Housing
We need to decide whether we want inclusionary or super-inclusionary housing in the Eastern Neighborhood.
A)-Baseline: 15% of total market rate production.
B)-Increase development potential zoning: creating new value to enable funding for additional affordable housing.
Options:-Increase percentage requirement of units.
-Charge affordable housing fee.
-Provide choices for more affordability (number of units versus median income limits).
2)-Affordable Housing Priority Zone
A)-Allow new residential uses in areas currently zoned industrial only.
B)-Allow 100% affordable developments as-of right.
C)-Create incentives for mixed income residential developments (donate portion of parcel for affordable housing in exchange of market rate housing)
D)-Allow 100% moderate-income developments without the need of competing with luxury housing.
3)-City-financed affordable housing developments:
A)-Current challenges are land availability and funding.
B)-Land represents 30-50% of City's subsidy and potential zone dedication could create over 1,000 affordable units.
C)-Because land would be donated throughout the process; the amount of money to fund units would be significantly less.
-There are very different affordable housing programs in the Bay View Hunter's Point.We are considering super inclusionary housing.
