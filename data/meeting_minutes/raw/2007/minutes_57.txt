9.Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
Land Use and Economic Committee
Both items were passed to the full Board [of Supervisors].
Board of Supervisors
-You will find in your packets a response to Commissioner Bill Lee's questions on Medical Cannabis Dispensaries (MCD) pertaining to saturation and location.
Âª%The legislation regulating MCD does not set a cap on the quantity or otherwise controlling proximity to each other.
Âª%The Planning Code however does guide permitted locations away from primarily residential zone districts and schools and more towards mixed use and commercial districts by limiting potential location for new MCD's.
Âª%MCD's that existed prior to this Medical Cannabis Act are not subject to these zoning restrictions unless their permit request is disapproved.They would be generally legalized in their current locations.
-Attached you will also find a map of the existing MCD locations.
-In a related note you may have read an article in today's Examiner that indicates that pot club permits were stuck in limbo according to the headline.
-You should know that there is no limbo as far as MCD permits at the Planning Department.
-To date, the Department has successfully completed full review, including public hearings for eight MCD operators.
-There are fourteen completed applications in the Department currently being processed.Eight of these have been scheduled for public hearing before this Commission and six are pending to be scheduled.
-The Department has not received applications for eight MCD operators.They are in jeopardy of being in non-compliance after the deadline of July 1.
-We have repeatedly stated at these hearings that the Department is committed to working with MCD owners and applicants to go through this permitting process.
-The department will work with MCD applicants that have filed complete applications to ensure that they finish that department's permit and review process.
-This is consistent with the pending Board [of Supervisors] resolution that San Francisco should not take enforcement action against those who have filed.
-The key word isfilefor permit application.
-There are eight MCD owners who have not filed with our Department.We have sent letters to these operators informing that it is imperative that they file all necessary permits, including the Planning Department, by the July 1 deadline.
-While the Board [of Supervisors] may extend the deadline for processing permits, importantly this extension would only apply to those who have filed and begun the process.
Amit Ghosh, Chief Planner
-In your packets you have received the response from staff to a question made by Commissioner Alexander on the city's applications for priority funding from regional agencies.
-This would be for MTC, ABAG and LEED efforts that would qualify areas in the city on the basis of its priorities for transit and planning for funding.
-We are preparing an application that would identify our transit areas and then show that the region recognizes the efforts that are not currently undergoing our planning efforts such as in our Downtown, Eastern Neighborhoods, Market and Octavia, Balboa and Glenn Park Neighborhood Plans.
-There is a map attached that only serves the purpose of identifying areas that might be eligible for funding.
Board of Appeals
NONE

SPEAKERS
Elizabeth Erhardt, Attorney for Ms. House
-Ms. House seeks to gain an interior access between her condominium, #905, and condominium #906 with a 48-inch opening in a non-load baring party wall between the condominiums.
-Ms. House paid $3.8 millions for the three units.The fair market retail value of unit #905 is between $815 and $825 thousands dollars.
-The unit consists of only 724 square feet.
-It would cost over $1,000 per square foot and by no account would this be considered affordable housing.
-The building was constructed after 1979 so it is not called within the rent ordinance.
-Also, rent caps cannot be applied to these units.
-These units never have been and never will be affordable housing.
-With respect to the desire to do the connection:previously that would not have fallen under the merger policy.
-In April 2003, under the interpretation of dwelling units combined, you extend the merger analysis.
-However, you will see that interpretation expresses and acknowledges that each of those units, despite having interior access, maintained their separate legal structure and entity.
-We are not permanently reducing the housing stock in San Francisco.
-With respect of the five criteria for mergers:Ms. House doesn't meet two because she is an owner/move in.
-The two relative to density restrictions are not applicable for any high-rise condominiums in San Francisco.
-There is only one criteria left that she could possibly meet and that is design deficiency.
-I would contend that it is a design deficiency to have a 724 square foot unit in San Francisco when we have a public policy that supports family housing.
-Looking at the Master Plan under policy 1.7, it encourages and supports the construction of quality family housing.
-Children and families are very much a part of the city's vitality.They bring life and transform the city.
-The Planning Department would study the feasibility of flexible development projects to accommodate family growth, shrinkage, expansion and extension.
-This is squarely within the flexibility.
-Policy 2.1 discourages the demolition of existing housing.It is not even applicable.
-We are not displacing anyone.It would be co-complaint because we are keeping the kitchen utilities.Landmark concerns are not applicable.
