6.Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Antonini
Mr. Badiner, Zoning Administrator
Commissioner Antonini
Mr. Badiner, Zoning Administrator
-We can have an actual discussion in September but we will get you something before you go on Hiatus.
Commissioner Moore
-I want to expand our discussion on the Level of Service of two weeks ago.This morning there was a very interesting article in the New York Times, I Love Paris on the Bus or Bike or Train - In Anything but a Car.
-Since we are basically inspired to be a world tourist destination, probably similar to Paris, I suggest that we all read this article.
-It speaks really strongly about the idea of constraining a car and creating traffic conflict until the car use is diminished.The Mayor of Paris is actively pursuing it.
-I have copied this article to the Mayor's Office who is interested in innovative thinking.I made copies for everybody else to read including staff.
-My second request is that we schedule a special meeting on reviewing CEQA.I brought this up a number of months ago.I do not see it on our Action List and would like to add it.
-There are a number of issues that I would like to get updated and informed on.
-How we deal with alternative analysis; contracting practices for EIR consultants; monitoring; required mitigations; and the list goes on.And not to speak on the latest interpretation by the State on how the State of California is looking at CEQA and leverages given to local jurisdictions to deal with particular issues such as socio economic analysis, etc.
-I would like to schedule this meeting as early as possible in late August or early September.I would like to get Commission support on that to be put on the Action List to schedule it.
Commissioner Olague
Commissioner Antonini
Commissioner W. Lee
Commissioner S. Lee
Commissioner Moore
-I have talked to even have outside experts to really speak about the art of CEQA.
-I am much respected of all the experience within the department but a fresh look advice will help us understand the difficulties of what the department but also independently of where we are at with the State of California.
The Commission decided to schedule a special meeting on CEQA procedures on a Wednesday afternoon (if possible), at or after 4:00p.m.
Commissioner Sugaya
-A number of meetings ago, I asked staff for some information on the status of various projects that were listed in the San Francisco's Business Times.
-I do not know if you got hold of it but I have it here in case you need it.
Commissioner Olague
-I want to see the Institutional Master Plan for the Academy of Art College.I want to understand their process.
-I know it requires a lot of sites and I think the current site is the Lorraine Hansberry Theater.I am just curious about their practices; I do no think we have ever heard about them here.
-I believe that the Institutional Master Plan is required every two years.
Mr. Badiner, Zoning Administrator
-We have tried to get responses.The way to start on that would be to get a memorandum to the Commission informing you where they are and what they have been trying to do.
-I do not think we are ready for an Institutional Master Plan, but we have been trying to get them and we have a strategy.
-It is only recently that they finally got the message and hired someone to help them.We have consistently been sending them letters in an attempt to get some compliance.I think they finally got someone on board within the last two months.
-We have been working diligently.I am glad you raised it.It is a complicated issue.
Commissioner Olague
-I requested a few weeks ago a list of projects in the Eastern Neighborhoods.
-I was wondering how and what criteria the department was using to recommend approval or disapproval of projects particularly in the Mission and in the Eastern Neighborhoods?
-Projects where the interim controls were applied?How the department applied the policies and what criteria was used?Which projects were approved and which ones were recommended for disapproval?
-Whether or not we actually recommended any changes to projects based on the policy or if the policies were just not really applied to projects?
-Finally, I have been talking and receiving emails from artists who live in areas that are currently zoned for industrial use in the Eastern Neighborhoods.
-This may mean we have a joint hearing with the Art Task Force or I may have to talk to somebody from that camp.
-I do not know if this is wide spread or just isolated incidents.
-As we see the change in zoning for some of these sites from industrial to potential residential and mixed use, I am hearing about people who resided in these spaces who are now suddenly facing eviction after living there for over ten years.
-I heard about it on two addresses already.I am just wondering if there is anything that we could do from the planning stand point.
-Are these sorts of things being tracked or not?I think it is commonly known that artists live in these spaces, and after paying rent for many years, now suddenly they are receiving their checks back and being told they have been illegally residing there.
-Finally; as far as the live/work loss, are they considered residential or not?
Mr. Badiner, Zoning Administrator
-They are considered non-conforming uses. It would have to be determined whether the uses were permitted at the time they were approved and maybe if they can continue on or be added to.These are unlike most non-conforming uses where the expectation is that they were going to fade away over a time period.
-If it was approved in 1995 and in that district they were permitted.They can change to that use.
Commissioner Sugaya
-If the staff needs some Commission help, we can always schedule a hearing on the Academy of Arts University Master Plan.
Commissioner Antonini
-I just wanted to ask staff.Some weeks ago I had requested a report on specifics comparing and contrasting Westbrook Plaza affordable housing on 7thStreet that came before us.There has been no discussion on impacts of those 49 units with 49 parking spaces.
-Why was this not scrutinized where market-rate housing with as small as 9 units were being scrutinized on the impacts to traffic, socio economics, etc?
-I just want to remind staff that I wanted to hear that sometime in the future.
7.Director's Announcements
None
8.Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
Mr. Badiner, Zoning Administrator
Government Audit and Oversight Committee
-Parking Hearing on the relationship between parking, neighborhood business and families requested by Supervisor Alioto-Pier.
The Transit Authority discussed the amount of parking available to customers and employees of small business; the impacts of parking; availability to neighborhood business; and the impact of parking availability on families.
The Planning Department discussed the feasibility of creating the one-to-one parking ratio city wide for families.
The MTA specifically discussed neighborhood parking garage regulations regarding uses of garages; parking revenues and expenditures over the pass six years or so; and the number of garages built.
The hearing lasted about three hours.It was a non-action item and it was continued because the Supervisor asked for further information.
Board of Supervisors
Board of Appeals

Terry Perera
-I have reviewed the proposed project.
-I and other seniors engineers at W.J.E have been involved in many peer reviews including the seismic micro retrofit of the PG&E Market Street complex, City Hall of Oakland, San Jose Arena, City Hall of San Francisco and recently for 180 Howard Street.
-The reviews for those projects were highly technical, lengthy and involved the continuous participation of DBI personnel throughout the process.Every meeting convened for the purpose of discussing the project.
-The peer review for 120 Howard Street however, has apparently been completed and the letter sent by the peer panel to DBI reports that the review process consisted of a site visit, meetings with MUA and a final meeting with SFDBI staff.
-DBI had little to do with the peer review for this proposed addition.The statement is consistent with all DBI representations to us since March that the peer review has not yet started.
-Representations made at the very same time that we were told by the project sponsor that the peer review was nearly complete.
-It is also consistent with Jim Miller's statement to us made nearly one week prior to the June 28 meeting of this Commission when it was first announced that the peer reviewed was completed, Hanson Tom had told him that it had not yet started.
-One more relevant fact, during the BIC meeting they stated that Raymond Louie was leading the 120 peer review.Mr. Louie has told W.J.E. that he does not know much about the problem and he has not been involved in it.
-The peer review letter is inadequate.The report does not respond directly to any of W.J.E. stated primary concerns and they report a silence on other concerns.
-We were excluded entirely from the process even after we were reassured by DBI that we would participate.
-The letter indicates that the peer review panel did identify a few instances of non-compliance of the engineer record for the vertical addition.
-The letter suggest that the peer review panel never saw the evidence of the other major earthquake safety issues that W.J.E. has found in the structural and architectural drawings.
-We have in the interim been in contact with the director of DBI.We made telephone calls and emails to try to get a hold of the final peer review report.None of our inquiries have been answered.
Mike Ward
-I am facility manager of Catholic Charities and our administrative office is at 180 Howard and we have three or four different programs and 40-45 people that come to the office.
-We are planning to have three or four programs moved to this location.
-I just wanted you to be aware that we are next door and how this would affect us in terms of safety and health of our staff, clients and the community if this building is ever taken down.
Alice Barkley
-I submitted a letter to this Commission requesting continuance of this item until after the Building Inspection hearing to discuss safety concerns.It is already scheduled.
-Normally this Commission and your Department take the position that seismic safety is not the concern of this Department.We are asking to test for toxic conditions to ensure the safety of the occupants.
-The peer review process is very unusual and was delayed.The process has been strictly between project sponsor, engineer and the peer review panel.There was no independent review.
Andrew Junius, Project Sponsor Representative
-This project was continued to today for the purpose of getting a couple more pieces of information:completion of peer review and allowing DBI to confirm they received that review.
-Both of those things you have in your packets.
-I want to direct you specifically to exhibit A to my letter to you where Director Hasenin specifically says in the second paragraph that this project should be allowed to proceed without further delays.
-The BAR Association and their attorney are simply looking for more ways to slow us down.
-Last week, they appeared at the Building Inspection Commission without telling us.They appeared at public comment and we were not given any notice and had no opportunity to appear on our behalf.
-Now, they are misrepresenting what the BIC said as if it were nothing.There was nothing on calendar.They simply directed staff to report back on this project in a couple of weeks.
-There is no rule that allows the peer review process to be open and include public participation.
-The engineers that we had look at this project and sign off on the structural system are at the top of their field.
Michael
-We have evaluated the existing structure's seismic performance using the most updated analysis methodology currently available.
-This type of analysis in design is the most accurate methodology and the result of the building performance is far superior than the one analyzed in design on conventional techniques.
-We found the building exceeds the seismic performance requirement for new buildings and requirement of seismic retrofit work.
-We evaluated the building based on an earthquake that happens on average every 2500 years and found that still has a significant margin against collapse.
-The peer review validated our results and our analysis is complete.They are in complete agreement that the proposed structural design exceeds the seismic performance required for new buildings.
-DBI also confirmed the peer review findings.
-The peer review process fully considered W.J.E. comments and incorporated them into the official peer review.We responded to each comment.
-W.J.E. comments were faulty for a number of reasons:They are based on a very rudimentary set of hand calculations and the calculations are based on the assumption that when the building displaces in an earthquake the bricks around the premises would push in on the concrete frame.
Pat Buscavich
-I am not retained by anybody on this.I am here because I wrote the section of the code that now is being applied.
-I have the best interest to make sure that this continues to be used.I am very concern that the integrity of the peer review and the alternate ladder procedure in chapter 16 are followed.
-I am going to follow up with the Building Department and make sure that they do follow the rules correctly.
-This is not the place for this discussion but at the Building Inspection Commission and I will be there to make sure that what I put in is followed correctly.

Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take discretionary review and approve the project as proposed
SPEAKERS
Tes Windo, Co-Owner
-I have been working with the dispensary since we opened.It has been nine years.
-I am unaware of any problems or concerns.We've never had one problem in the neighborhood.
-Every other business owner signed a letter of support for us.The people that visit our dispensary were willing to sign letters but we decided to have them only from neighbors.
-We have never had the police at our doors.We have a very wide corner with three big windows and we police the corners.
-I am shocked that someone is opposing.We did not even tell people to come to support us.
Aaron Holmberg, Resident of 1878 Market Street
-I am directly next door and my only window is on an airway.My objection is the fumes.
-They do not smoke there but there are a lot of products and the smell is obnoxious.
-The fume comes through the airway and fills out my room.
Fadda
-I live in Emeryville and am an actor.
-As a patient, this is the only club where I can go in with $3 and come out with a bag of pot.
-Before this club opened up, I used to spend $300 or $400 per day for my medicine.
-This club has given me real health information to keep HIV out of my life and body.
Shawna
-I am in favor of this club for serving the community compassionately and responsibly.
-I am concerned that the gentleman did not address this issue before where it could have been reasonably responded to.
-Urged the Commission to measure his statement with [the understanding that it could have been] mediated before hand.
Tara
-They are the  gold standard  and I hope you approve this project.
Sheipherd
-If there are patients who have cancer and aids who want to smoke a little pot, the State of California has made that legal.
-If somebody has an issue with the smell, it should be addressed with them personally.
-There are a lot of other issues with smell around the City.

12.(Tape IB; IIA)(A. LIGHT/C. NIKITAS: (415) 558-6254/(415) 558-6306)
OFFICE DEVELOPMENT ANNUAL LIMIT-Informational presentation on the status of the office allocation square footage, and a review of entitled projects that have exceeded their statutory eighteen-month approval period, and a discussion of amendments to previous Commission Resolutions that would establish criteria for the disposition of these entitlements. Such amendments could be adopted at a future hearing.
SPEAKERS
Sue Hestor
-This was put on a ballot by the voters.It was started by the Planning Department as a three year trial period with the full intention that it be a temporary limit.
-A lot of the terms that Mr. Nikitas spoke about were drafted by the public.
-I find it strange to listen to staff saying basically that we have taken away the power of a Commission that acted seven or eight years ago.
-The Planning Commission resolution can be repealed by another Planning Commission and I am asking you to do it.
-We have a situation where we can have a project that gets activated after nine years on the solo say of the Zoning Administrator without giving public notice to any body.
-I have not heard the words environmental review cross people's lips in the context of what you do when something is this old.
-I have not seen any of these decisions, 524 Howard in particular, rules on their environmental review.I have not received a copy of the Zoning Administrator's Determination that I requested.
-You can not keep projects alive indefinitely on an environmental review that was originally done 25 years ago.
-The Commission has to take the power back.The public deserves it.
Jeffrey Heller
-It is interesting to talk to you from the perspective of being deeply involved in this for twenty five or more years.
-We have worked on a number of projects and to list some:250 Montgomery, 55 Second, 555 Mission that is under construction, and most projects on Rincon Hill.All those projects started construction many years after their approval.
-There is a fundamental economic truth here and that is the long arduous process of getting approval puts you in a place where you may not be in the right economic arena to be able to commence.
-Ms. Hestor mentioned 524 Howard, which was re-approved by the Commission not so long ago.It is an office building and an entirely proper use for that area.
-I brought a chart to show how long it takes from the moment that you, as the Commission, approve the project, to the date that we can put a shovel in the ground (assuming that the sponsor does not risk the money to do the work in advance of the approval).
-It takes almost eighteen months.If you push hard and everything goes right, by the end of the eighteen months you can actually start construction.
-It is not realistic that the Commission should impose that is the only way that a building can get built in the City.
Jim Reuben
-I am speaking on the item generically.We have a number of the buildings that are on your list that are also clients of ours.
-The economic cycles in San Francisco have been deep and short.
-There is not enough time in a single economic cycle to acquire a piece of property and go through a very difficult, arduous risky process and get that building built.
-The only building that I am aware that has done it in a single economic cycle is 560 Mission Street.
-We also prepared a chart to show you all the large projects--including photographs and locations--showing the date of the entitlement and date the construction started, if they in fact have started construction.
-The average period of time between the grant of entitlement and the commencement of construction is 46 months.That is what it takes to go through this process.One of our projects took 64 months.
Deborah Stein
-I am troubled by Ms. Hestor's confusion about the exercise of and the possession of power on land use.
-You possess the power to revoke any 321 or any permit that is not fully fulfilled.
-The report before you today on the status and staff processing these permits is not a disempowerment of this Commission.
-This Commission retains all of its authority and judgment.That makes a difference in selective bodies in the City.
-In this cases, and in all cases the Commission continues to look thoughtfully when to exercise its power.
Robert Herr, 350 Bush and 500 Pine projects
-Those projects are joined at the hip.They are basically companions.
-It took four years to achieve the entitlement of those two combined projects.
-These projects provide benefits to the community.
-I have been working diligently for three and a half years since the entitlement became final with the approval of the Board of Supervisors to move forward with that project.
-They have started the rehabilitation of the landmark building by removing a non –historic shade at the rear of the building and have contributed over $400,000 as a commitment to affordable housing opportunities in the community.
TayVia, Copeland
-I am representing the project sponsor of the 1stand Howard project.I want to reiterate two things that Mr. Nikitas highlighted.
-First, this project is part of that four corner development and this is the last building in that phase that was not able to go forward due to the economic down turn.
-In 2005 when the market start to look like it might come back, the project sponsor did do plans and applied for a building permit.
-We have been in the building permit process for nine months.We therefore believe the project sponsor has been proceeding diligently and at this point is in the hands of the city.
ACTION:Informational only.No action by the Commission.However, the Chair (Vice President Christina Olague) instructed staff to schedule status reports on 3433 3rdSt, 500 Pine St, 801 Market St, & 350 Bush St.Staff is also to schedule a hearing to review the Resolution.

Amendments relating to Planning Code Sections 716.1, 716.41, and 716.42 of the Inner Clement Street Neighborhood Commercial District [Board File No. 07-0738].Ordinance introduced by Supervisor McGoldrick amending Planning Code Sections 716.1, 716.41, and 716.42 of the Inner Clement Street Neighborhood Commercial District to provide for a limited number of new full-service restaurants and new wine and beer bar uses that satisfy specific requirements and obtain conditional use authorization, making environmental findings, and making findings of consistence with the General Plan and priority policies of Planning Code Section 101.1. Preliminary Recommendation: Approval.
SPEAKERS
Steve Vettel
-I have been working with the owners of Cute Restaurant on Clement Street.
-We worked with Supervisor McGoldrick to draft this legislation with the cooperation of the Clement Street Association.
-This is very modest.All of them would be a conditional use authorization and you would hear individual cases.
-This NCD is quite long - from Arguello to Funston Street.It is thirteen blocks on both sides of the street.So it is quite a large NCD.
ACTION:Approved as amended:
-Request that the Board of Supervisor consider a slight increase in the number [of uses from 3] in consideration of the length of the district.

SPEAKERS
Calvin Welch, Discretionary Review Requestor
-This is an extraordinarily straight forward issue.Is this building a sound building?Is this proposed project a demolition?
-The answer to both of those questions that your staff says on its July 16 review of the DR request is yes.
-However, staff's assertion that this violates no General Plan policy is less that clear.
-It violates both the 2004 and 1990 policy.That is exactly the same language on policy 2.1 of objective 2 to discourage the demolition of sound existing housing.
-Your staff says that this is sound housing and that this is in effect a demolition.
-The point is if a $1.2 million house in my neighborhood can be demolished when it is sound, then what building is safe?
-101.1 of the Planning Code clearly states that the neighborhood character should be respected and obviously this does not respect neighborhood character.
-It is a sound building being demolished in violation the 1990 and 2004 Housing Elements.
Sue Hestor
-It is really hard having a 5-person Commission.And I really think that this case should be continued until there is at least a 6thmember.
-There are some really basic issues here.The Housing Element right now is 1990 and that has stronger anti-demolition policies.
-This is a sound house.And what you are saying with this one is that anything in Haight-Ashbury can be demolished like this.They are all $1.2 million dollars these days.
-Please continue this item.
John Miniskalko, Architect
-This house was purchased in April 2005 with the intention of adding on to accommodate the needs of a growing family.
-There is a shortage of family housing in San Francisco.
-With the desire to keep their family in San Francisco, they decided to buy the property with the potential to expand because it is the smallest house on the block and does not have an affect on adjacent neighbors.
-The design was submitted following a highly supportive community outreach meeting.The DR requestor was invited to attend but did not attend.
-The project was later deemed to be a defacto demolition because of the amount of change to the existing walls involved in the enlargement of the project.
-At the submission of a full historic resource evaluation that was reviewed by Planning, it was found not to be a resource or architecturally significant and a Categorical Exemption was then issued.
-Today's hearing is not on design or Planning Code compliance of the proposed project, but on the appraised value of the existing house.
-The first request for appraisal reported a value of $1.2 million.The second request for appraisal reported a value of $1.23 million.
-Both appraisals were sent to the San Francisco Real State Division who confirmed the validity of both appraisals.
-Based on the fact that this case presents no exceptional or extraordinary circumstances and has the full support of the Planning Department, we ask the Planning Commission to not take discretionary review and approved the project as submitted.
