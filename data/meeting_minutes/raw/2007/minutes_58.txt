5.Commission Comments/Questions
-I just want to report that the Commission in its closed session today did vote to send three names to the Mayor as candidates for the Director of Planning position.
-It should be forthcoming.Beyond that, the Commission voted to not disclose any other elements of that meeting.
-I just want to ask staff in regards to the issue of Western SOMA separation from the Eastern Neighborhoods -- A couple of years ago we talked about this and why this particular neighborhood was allowed to conduct its own planning process.
-It has been so long that maybe the public would like to hear about why the planning process is being done somehow independently than other areas being done by this department.
-I am a believer that the entire city should be involved in the planning process even thought the neighborhood has an immediate stake in the outcome.
-I have a question of whether the projects in the Western SOMA are going to be handled differently than the rest of the Eastern Neighborhoods?
-Impacts should be evaluated in the same manner as the other neighborhoods.
-I thought of that in reference to a project that came up last week at 224 7thStreet being very good architecturally, providing affordable housing plus parking.
-There were no questions of what impact this project might be in terms of general impacts.
-To be consistent, we have to look at all projects and at least discuss the impacts.
-During Commissioner's Matters, Commissioners raise questions and staff has been very diligent in tracking and responding to these questions.
-I just wanted to acknowledge that it has happened.
-Since the public is also hearing these questions, I believe there should be a short presentation of the work that we are getting back.
-The public needs to also hear of what we are receiving in these short memorandums.
-I suggest that somebody take a couple of minutes and summarizethehighlights of those answers.
-I just want to follow up with Mr. Badiner on the request I had about block book notation fees.
-I have not forgotten about that request.I will check with assigned staff.
-I just want to mention that I did receive answers to some questions specifically to one case on Golden Gate Avenue.
-I still disagree with staff.I will get back to staff directly.
-We received an example of a case report and I would get back to staff with two suggestions that I have.
6.Director's Announcements
None
7.Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
AnMarie Rodgers reported on Board of Supervisors' events:
Government Audit and Oversight
-Supervisor Alioto-Pier sponsored a public hearing on the impacts of parking on neighborhood businesses and families.
-Staff from Municipal Transportation Agency [MTA], San Francisco County Transportation Authority [SFCTA] and Planning had plans to speak.However, because of the busy agenda, it has been postponed to July.
Land Use CommitteeNone (Canceled)
Board of Supervisors
-Last April this Commission recommended to the Board that they consider amending sections 311 and 312 to add microcells to the list of permit applications subject to neighborhood notifications.
-Supervisor Peskin has indicated that he intends to move forward with this notice idea.
2-A Resolution authorizing this department to apply for Work Force Housing Reward Grant -Adopted
-The Department had applied for this grant last year and received over $740,000.That money funded Mission Streetscapes and public ramp improvement effort.
-The authorization considered this week would cover a second grant from the same fund.
-This year we have applied for another $870,000.If it is successful, the Department's intent is to use it for further work on the Mission Streetscapes plan.
-This money would articulate specifically a demonstration project on Cesar Chavez to design and build specific pedestrian, traffic calming and intersection improvements.
-Grant awardees would be announced around the end of June or early July.
3-The third resolution urged the Department to fully analyze water supply alternatives in the Tuolumne River Environmental Impact Report [EIR].
-This resolution urges the department to look at alternatives that would not resolve in increased diversions of freshwater from Tuolumne River.
-It urges the Planning Commission to undertake and implement water conservation and water recycling programs.
-For our part, the Department is working to address these issues in the program EIR.
-It was schedule to be heard by the City Operations Committee this week but due to scheduling and noticing requirements as well as the 4thof July holiday this ordinance cannot be scheduled before this Commission until July 12th.
-It couldn't be heard at the Board of Supervisor until July 26th.
-There is a gap from the deadline to when the Board of Supervisor can actually consider the extension.
-Supervisor Alioto-Pier had discussed introducing a resolution to urge departments charged with MCD regulations to postponed enforcement until the Board has had the opportunity to consider extending the deadline.
-As I mentioned last week, it should be noted that this proposed extension would not apply to MCD operators who have not begun the application process as of July 1, 2007.
-It is still imperative that MCD's file for necessary permit with the various city agencies including the  D  permits with the Planning Department by the June 30 deadline.
-Supervisor Maxwell introduced an extension to the Planning Department Review of the Visitacion Valley Fee Amendment.
-Supervisor Daly requested a hearing on the environmental impacts of the Lennar Development at the Hunter's Point Shipyard.
Mr. Badiner, Zoning Administrator
Board of Appeals
-Often, we try to arrange to hold hearings for variances on the same day the Commission considers the discretionary review.
-Section 311 says that when the Planning Department determines that a project is co-compliant, notices should be sent.
-The Attorney representing the next door neighbor says that you cannot do that until holding and approving the variance and then send the 311 notices.
D.GENERALPUBLIC COMMENT – 15 MINUTES(Tape IA)
At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting.Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
SPEAKERS
Georgia Schuttish
-I was here two weeks ago and Mr. Badiner and Mr. Crawford wrote a memorandum in response to what I said.
-It does not really answer what I came here to talk about except for the last paragraph where you tell about the roof.
-I spoke about the alteration that is really a demolition.
-I showed the renderings I took to the Board of Appeals after you denied the Discretionary Review.
-I found out that the roof was changed because two neighbors had a problem with the view and it was changed to be flat.
-I went to the files and found out about all these emails between the staff, neighbors and project sponsors.
-Neighbors signed a petition -- not the ones who filed for discretionary review -- and it seems they got what they asked for -- preserve their view.
-My concern is that why after everything is done somebody comes and complains because of view and it gets changed?Change it back.
All matters listed hereunder constitute a Consent Calendar, are considered to be routine by the Planning Commission, and will be acted upon by a single roll call vote of the Commission.There will be no separate discussion of these items unless a member of the Commission, the public, or staff so requests, in which event the matter shall be removed from the Consent Calendar and considered as a separate item at this or a future hearing.
SPEAKERS
Johanna, 1530 Hayes Street
-I am challenging the approval of this conditional use.

280 Divisadero Street-Public Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR).The project site (Assessor's Block 1238, Lot 23) is located at 280 Divisadero Street, between Page and Haight Streets, in the Lower Haight neighborhood of the Western Addition district.The site consists of a single parcel, and is 6,875 square feet in area; it is within a NC-2 (Small-Scale Neighborhood Commercial) Zoning District and within a 40-X Height and Bulk District.The project site is City Landmark No. 190, the Charles L. Hinkel House and Carriage House, and contains two structures:a four-story single-family dwelling (the  main house ) and a two-story building that originally served as a carriage house for the property (the  carriage house ).The project sponsor's proposal includes both exterior alterations and interior structural repairs to the carriage house, so that the resulting, essentially new building can be legalized as a second residential unit on the lot.Based on the proposed scope of work, the Planning Department has determined that the project would be considered  demolition  of the carriage house under the standards set forth in Article 10 of the Planning Code.The project is limited to the carriage house; no physical changes to the main house are proposed.The project sponsor is seeking a Variance because the carriage house is located within the required rear yard open space of the main house.
