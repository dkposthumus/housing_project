55 LagunaMixed Use Project-Public Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Report-The project site is located at 55 Laguna Street in the Hayes Valley neighborhood of San Francisco on the two city blocks bounded by Haight Street to the north, Laguna Street to the east, Hermann Street to the south, and Buchanan Street to the west. The proposed project would include new construction as well as renovation of most of the vacant buildings on the former University of California Berkeley Extension Campus to provide residential, community facility, retail space, open space and parking. The project site currently contains four buildings that were formerly occupied by educational uses, including Woods Hall, Woods Hall Annex, Richardson Hall and Middle Hall. The project site also contains the UCSF dental clinic that is currently in use. The project would renovate Woods Hall, Woods Hall Annex, and most of Richardson Hall to be used for residential and community facility space. Middle Hall would be demolished, as would the Richardson Hall Administration wing, a small single-story portion of Richardson Hall located at the north end of the building. New infill construction would include the development of seven new residential buildings ranging in height between three and eight stories. The tallest building, at a maximum height of 85 feet, would be built by an organization called open-house, specifically for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender seniors (hereinafter referred to as the open-house building). The proposed project would accommodate up to 450 residential units including approximately 85 units in the open-house building, approximately 10,000 sq. ft. of community facility space, and up to 5,000 occupied sq. ft. of retail space. The project would provide a variety of open spaces, including a privately owned, publicly accessible park, which would be located along the Waller Street alignment. The project would provide approximately 352 on-site parking spaces, including 51 spaces for the dental clinic and up to 10 spaces for a car share organization primarily within four below ground garages, and a small amount of above-ground parking. The project would require a change in the zoning district from P (Public) to RTO (Residential-Transit Oriented) and NCT-3 (Neighborhood Commercial Transit Moderate Scale Mixed-Use), new zoning classifications proposed for Market and Octavia Area Plan, or a mixed-used Special Use District. The dental clinic would remain in a P zoning district. The project would also require an adjustment in the height and bulk designations of the site from 40 X and 80-B to 40-X, 50-X and 85-X. The proposed project would also require an amendment to the San Francisco General Plan to allow the change from a public/institutional use designation to residential mixed-use designations, and to allow an increase in building heights.
Note: Written comments will be received at the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m. on March 19, 2007.
Preliminary Recommendation:No action required.
(Continued from Regular Meeting of March 8, 2007)
