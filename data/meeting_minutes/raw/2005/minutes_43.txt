7.  Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner W. Lee
Re:  Home Depot Project
- He requested a status of the Home Depot project.
- It is his understanding that the discussion at the State Assembly level regarding CEQA changes is the review of the EIR for Home Depot.
- He would like a status of this during the Director's Report.
Commissioner Olague:
Re:  Health Impact Assessment
- Even though there was a hearing today on this matter, she would like to schedule a second hearing because she still has a lot of questions.
Commissioner Antonini:
Re:  Meetings Scheduled
- He asked for a presentation on the role of the Board of Permit appeals relative to the Planning Commission.
- He aIso requested a presentation by staff on the relative roles of the Planning Commission, the Redevelopment Agency, and the Port Commission.  This would be to get information on the jurisdictional authorities, where the boundaries are, what happens when there are questions that arise that might cross jurisdictions, etc?  Is there any agency that oversees the function(s) of all these agencies or commissions?
C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT
8. Director's Announcements
Director Macris reported:
Re:  EPS Report
- The EPS report and analysis on the supply and demand of PDR space is available to the public here at the hearing and it is also available on the Planning Department's website.
Re:  SF STAT
- The SF STAT program which is the Mayor's program for determining progress made in various departments, is usually scheduled on a quarterly basis.
- Staff will be making a presentation on Monday to the Mayor, staff and other city officials regarding the progress the department is making.
- He will inform the Commission about this also.
Commissioner Olague:
- Will there be a second report to the Commission with EPS on the PDR Study?
Director Macris responded:
- Nothing is scheduled, but he is talking with the Board of Supervisors about whether they would like to have some presentation.
- But there is no plan to have a second presentation.
Commissioner Olague:
- It was her understanding at the first hearing that it was just an overview and when the report was published, there would be a second presentation.
Director Macris responded:
- The next step is to have staff draft a statement that would set the implications of that work and combine both things.
- He could have the previous presenter here to go over the information again and talk about the implications of it.
Commissioner Olague:
- When will it be complete?
Director Macris responded:
- Sometime in May.
Commissioner Antonini:
- He would be interested in hearing this information also.
9. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
(Reported by the Zoning Administrator):
BOS -
Re:  Harding Theatre
- This appeal was continued a few times.
- The Zoning Administrator and Paul Maltzer of staff withdrew the Negative Declaration so the Conditional Use needs to come back before the Commission.
- A revised Negative Declaration needs to be presented to the project sponsor.
- It seems there is consensus at the Board that this is a good project.
Rules Committee:
- Next Monday there will be a hearing on a moratorium of the medical cannabis dispensers.
- Dan Sider of Planning Department staff will be preparing a report on this and will present it to the Commission perhaps next week.
BOA -
Re:  Elections
- Mike Garcia was appointed to the Board Commissioner, Bill Sugaya as President and Commissioner Saunders as Vice President.
- During the Public Comment period the Zoning Administrator expressed the Planning Commission's desire to have a joint hearing with the Board.  The Board agreed to this.
- He has not spoken to Secretary Avery or Commissioner Sue Lee on the date but there is a suggestion for early June.
Re:  724 Van Ness Avenue
- The Zoning Administrator made a determination that all units could be turned into condominiums.
- This was very controversial.
- Ultimately the Board upheld his decision which said the market rate units were not deemed to be rental, but that the affordable housing/inclusionary housing units must remain rental.
- There was a +4-0 vote.
Re: 261 26thAvenue
- The Commission found the building to be unsound but disapproved the new construction.
- The Board agreed that the building was unsound but disapproved the new construction because they found that the new units would not be affordable.

Joe O'Donaghue - Residential Builders
Re:  Public Comment

- He is happy that there will be a hearing at the Board of Supervisors where many issues like this will be discussed.
Richard Marquez - Mission Street and 6thStreet Agenda
Re:  Mid-Market Plan
- He applauded the No votes from Commissioner Bradford Bell and Olague last week.
- The Mission, Bay View Hunters Point, and SOMA have suffered declines due to gentrification.

Re: 1223 Bosworth Street
Cristian Hogan - Project Architect
- The Discretionary Review requestor was worried about his view but he [the architect] feels that the project will not block the view or limit the light and air.
- Taking DR would be an abuse to the system.
- It would be impossible to design the house in a three-story envelope because of the very small size.
- He has spent hundreds of hours on the design of this project.
- The proposed home is code compliant.
James Sanguinetti - Discretionary Review Requestor
- He understands that the Commission viewed the video of the previous hearing.
- The proposed home will impact his light and privacy.
- The lot is so extremely shallow that the proposed home will tower over his house.
- It was mentioned that his house is unique, but there are a few houses that sit back into the hill.
- He objects also to the overall mass and height of the proposed project.
- The home would not be in character with the other homes in the neighborhood.

301 MISSION STREET- south side between Fremont and Beale Street, Lots 1 and 17 in Assessor's Block 3719 -Request under Planning Code Section 309 (Downtown Code) for Determinations of Compliance and an exception to rear yard requirements (Section 134(d)).The subject property is located within the C-3-O Zoning District as well as the 550-S and 400-S Height and Bulk Districts. The proposed project is to change the mix of uses and make minor changes to a portion of the building envelope on a previously approved mixed-use project, which was approved for 130,000 square feet of office space in a nine-story mid-rise building; 320 residential units and 120 extended stay hotel suites in a 58-story tower; 9,400 square feet of ground floor retail and 18,710 square feet of public and private open space contained within a base podium element; and four levels of below-grade parking.  The previously approved project was so conditioned that if in the judgment and at the discretion of the property owner, the hotel market did not sufficiently justify the operation of the proposed hotel facility, the 120 extended stay hotel units would be authorized for conversion to an equal number of residential units.  Therefore, the previously approved project was approved for a total of 440 dwelling units under specific conditions, all contained within the 58-story tower.  The modified project would eliminate the office and hotel uses, and would contain a total of 420 dwelling units, placing 54 of these units in the former 130,000 square-foot office building envelope, and 366 larger dwelling units would occupy the entire tower building envelope.  The ground level retail space would be reduced to 7,900 square feet, and there would be approximately 6,700 square feet of public open space, although with the removal of the office and hotel uses, no public open space is actually required by the Planning Code.   The proposed residential and retail uses would be contained in substantially the same building envelopes as were approved for the previous mixed-use project, with minor changes to the mid-rise building facade and a rear yard exception required for the dwellings within it.

RINCON HILL PLAN-Certification of Environmental Impact 
          Report. The proposed project is a revised Rincon Hill Plan (an Area 
          Plan of the San Francisco General Plan) and revised planning controls 
          for the Rincon Hill area. The San Francisco Planning Department proposes 
          to replace the Planning Code's existing Rincon Hill Special Use District 
          (SUD), as set out in Planning Code Section 249.1, with a new Rincon 
          Hill Downtown Residential Mixed Use District (DTR), which would increase 
          height limits, revise the "R" bulk district, amend the Rincon 
          Hill Area Plan, and make other General Plan and zoning changes intended 
          to stimulate additional high-density, residential development in the 
          Rincon Hill area. Improvements to the streetscape, transportation system 
          and open space would result from implementation of the new Plan. Rincon 
          Hill is in the northeast section of San Francisco, south of the Financial 
          District and Transbay Terminal, and north of the South Beach neighborhood. 
          The project area is bounded generally by Folsom Street, Steuart Street, 
          The Embarcadero, Bryant Street, the Bay Bridge approach and the Transbay 
          Terminal ramps and encompasses about 12 city blocks.
NOTE:The public hearing on the Draft EIR is closed. The 
          public comment period for the Draft EIR ended on December 10, 2004.

- San Francisco needs more housing and the only way to achieve this is to go higher and denser.
- There was already a Rincon Hill plan in place but is outdated.
Kate White - San Francisco Housing Action Coalition
- This is a momentous occasion for San Francisco.
- She congratulated the Planning staff for their hard work for so many years.
- They support projects if they accompany open spaces, affordable housing, community space, retail, etc.  This is exactly what this plan entails.
Joe Curtin
- He works for an organization in the Castro.
- Does not support high towers that are only for rich people.
- He does support slender towers that will provide benefits to the community.
- He hopes that there are a high percentage of low-income units.
Robert Meyers
- He urged the Commission to approve this plan and "grandfather" 375 Fremont Street.
- This plan will allow a park and a great open space.
- The project sponsor of 375 Fremont Street submitted their permits and plans many years ago.  Their project should be decided upon under the old zoning.  This project should not be looked at under the same guidelines as this Rincon Hill plan.
John Schlesinger
- They endorse the plan.
- The only issue they have is regarding the exceptions.
- The Commission should approve this plan and not allow exceptions.
Theodore Brown - Brown Brown, LLC
- He submitted plans for a project many years ago.
- The specifics of his project have changed.  The zoning of the Rincon Hill area has changed.
- He hopes that the Commission will "grandfather" the projects that have been in the pipeline.
- It would be good to keep Discretionary language in the text.
Ellen Lou - Skidmore, Owings & Merrill
- There are certain points that are critical for this plan. It is very important to specifically locate tall buildings.  Towers should be slender.  Views should be ensured.  If there is not enough space between the towers it would create a wall like use.  Being pedestrian friendly is an important issue as well.
Susan Vaughan - Pedestrian Safety Advisory Committee
- The committee endorses the Rincon Hill Plan but also encourages in addition an on demand pedestrian crossing at the pedestrian alley and First Street.
- They would also like to review the pedestrian and traffic proposals for Harrison Street since it had not been finished at the time.
- Eliminating all parking for privately owned automobiles would be a good idea.
- The area is an extremely rich transit area.
Fernando Marti - Asian Neighborhood Design
- The purpose of the plan is to increase housing in San Francisco.
- Yet the EIR states that the project would do little to alleviate the housing needs of the City.
Peter Cohen - Urban Solutions
- This plan is an economic opportunity for community building.
- The Commission needs to look at this enormous packet.
- There is a lot of information on the fee program.
- The Commission should look at the Mello-Roos that could be imposed on future property owners as well as impact fees being charged on current property developments.
Reed Bement - Rincon Hill Residents Association
- He commends the long range planning staff.
- Eliminate the special treatment on Fremont Street because they are not consistent with the rest of the Rincon Hill projects.
Tom Radulovich - Transportation for a Livable City
- There is too much parking in this plan.
- This neighborhood could be made an ecological place for people to live.
- This area has the best public transportation.
- Many people do not own a car.
- Is this housing for San Franciscans?
- It would be a big mistake to approve the pipeline projects on Fremont Street.
John O. Ebenesian
- He owns property in the area.
- He has been working in the area also and is concerned with the traffic.
- The noise level for his business is very difficult.
- He supports this plan but he does not see any consideration of what would happen to small businesses during the process of this plan.
- He commends staff for their hard work.
Sarah Silva - SF Archdiocese
- Many parishioners are worried about housing and income levels.
- She hopes that the pipeline project on Fremont Street will be included in this plan.
- They afford housing at all income levels.
George Wesoleh - SF Archdiocese
- He hopes that the Commission will include the Fremont Street project into this plan.  It is a matter of fairness.
- They have spent a lot of money on this.
- He believes that this project really fits with the plan.
Charles Kullman - Old St. Mary's Church
- They are very concerned about community.
- Although they are in favor of the plan, the increase of inclusionary housing is very important.
- Affordable housing is really needed.
- He hopes the Commission will include the pipeline projects on Fremont Street.
Bill Applegate - Catholics for the Common Good
- This is a very good plan.
- He hopes that the Fremont Street project will be included into the project because it is a win, win proposition.
- The project will enhance livability.
Rev. John A. Balleza - St. Patrick's Church
- They have a vested interest in the inclusion to the Fremont Street project because it will ensure more housing for their families.
Eleanor F. Killebrew - Brownbrew
-  She hopes that the Commission will include the projects on Fremont Street.
- Plans were submitted three expensive years ago for these projects.
- Each delay causes more money to be lost.
Ben Ortega
- He commended staff for putting on a great project.
- The projects on Fremont Street were submitted about three years ago.
- Staff has recommended that the projects need to conform to the new specific plan and many people want to see this.
- The Commission should approve to include these projects.
Jerry Rampelberg
- He agrees with including the Fremont Street projects with the Rincon Hill plan.
- These projects filed their permits a few years ago.
- It is unfair to ask the project sponsor to revise their plans even thought they have abided by all the guidelines.
Duane Carlson - Avalon Bay
- The Fremont Street project should be included into the Rincon Hill Plan because it will allow for more housing.
- The projects will be more comfortable because of the tower separation.
Jim Salinas, Sr. - Carpenter's Union - Local 22
- He urged the Commission to support allowing the two projects on Fremont Street to be included in the Rincon Hill Plan.
- The jobs provided and the housing are beneficial to the City.
- It is important to support responsible developers that use union workers.
(did not state name)
- Many people have felt disenfranchised because the Rincon Hill Plan has been separate from the other community plans.
- Rincon Hill is not a new neighborhood.
- Even though there has been a lot of work done on the plan, there have been surrounding neighborhoods that have been ignored.
- The plan should respect the look and feel of the Lansing Neighborhood.
Diego Sanchez
- He works in a company that provides affordable housing.
- The Rincon Hill Plan does not deal with the needs of the City of San Francisco much less the residents of the South of Market.
- This plan should not move forward until there has been more dialogue.
Erick Quesada
- There is still a lot to look at in this plan.
- Not one job on this plan should be non-union.
- The working class community will come here to work for union jobs and affordability.
Chis Durazo - SOMECAN
- She agrees with union jobs.
- The residents of the South of Market feel ignored.
- Access is what the residents want but it seems that the Rincon Hill Plan will be for exclusive people only.
- There are very few parks in the area.
April Veneracion - SOMECAN
- She does not want to dismiss all the work that staff has done on this plan.
- The discussion here is about equity.
- The plan does not meet the needs of all the residents of San Francisco.
- She is encouraged on the movement of community benefits but she would like to see it first.
Sue Hestor
- The most precious resource of the City is land.
- If 85% of the housing is high-end, the rest of the residents are being ignored.
- South of Market is a place where there should be inclusionary housing.
- There is not a very good transit plan included.  The area is not very transit rich.
Azalia Merrell
- She agrees with including the Fremont Street projects in this plan.
- There are many people who are willing and available to start working.
Bob McCarthy
- The projects on Fremont Street did not "drop out of the sky."
- The planning policies of the last 25 years should be respected.
- These projects should be included in the Rincon Hill Plan.
Angelica Cobande - SOMECAN
- She hopes that the Commission will not forget all the families and residents of South of Market that were here to speak bout affordable housing.
- These residents have been here for many years.
