At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.In response to public comment, the commission is limited to:

(2) Requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or
(3) Directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.(Government Code Section 54954.2(a))

- I find it ironic that throughout the ‘90s when the Residential Builders through Sue Hester was fighting protest after protest, brief after brief on behalf of an undisclosed client that delayed and cost projects thousands of dollars that never once did any bureaucrat in the Planning Department raise the issue of who the undisclosed client was.
- However, now that the Andrews Act is filed on behalf of an undisclosed client, suddenly it has become an issue.
- That is fine.
- I disagree with everything Andrew Zaches does, but I respect his right to do it.
- But we are not going to be precluded from the cover up that is happening at the Building Department.
- There was no investigation done on this property.
- Every complaint that has been done to the Bureau of Building Inspection in the past warrants an investigation when asked for.
- None has been granted.
- Everyone has freedom of speech and people have the right to protest.
- Again there is an attempt to deflect from the issue
- And it is a cover up.
- Actually the Zoning Director should not testify like the Building Department officials who are precluded from testifying.They should have brought in an outsider to testify because of the relationship.
- This of course doesn’t end here.
