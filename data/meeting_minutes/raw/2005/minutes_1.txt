C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT
12. Director's Announcements
Interim Director Macris:
- He introduced Alicia John-Baptiste as the new Chief Administrative Officer.
Zoning Administrator Reported:
Re:  724-730 Van Ness Avenue (cross Street Turk)
- On June 20, 2002, the Commission approved this project that consisted of 141 units.
- Project sponsor stated that it would be rental, geared for students, etc.
- The project was sold to someone else.  The new project sponsor applied for 104 units.
- He received a letter in August of 2004 that asked the question of whether or not the new project was in general conformity with what the Commission had originally approved.
- He determined that it was not the same project.
- The project sponsor appealed this determination and submitted a new proposal for 130 units.  This would make it the same type of project.
- He received an additional letter from the original sender, asking further question about a variety of issues, specifically rental versus for sale.
- He then determined that the Commission made no mention about rental or for sale (except for the inclusionary housing).
- The first letter was appealed before the Board of Appeals last night. However, there was a request to have this continued.
Commissioner Sue Lee:
Re:  Schedule something on the Calendar
- When projects have been modified from the Commission's conditional use approval, she requested that they be scheduled before the Commission.
- The Commission should discuss this in terms of their own action vs. the Zoning Administrator's interpretation.
- She suggested that this be scheduled on February 3, 2005.
13. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
BOS - None
BOA:
Re: Dolores Mews
- The Board upheld the determination that it was within the bounds of the Conditional Use and did not need to come back.
D. GENERALPUBLIC COMMENT - 15 MINUTES
At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
Joe O'Donaghue
Re:  New Officers at the Commission
- He congratulated Commissioner Sue Lee and Commissioner Alexander on their elections as President and Vice President.
Re:  The Permit Process
- There are a lot of problems with the way a permit is obtained.
- There has been a lot of talk about "undo influence" at the Board of Supervisors and people from the Mayor's Office.
- It seems that their friend's projects have been put at the beginning of the line and this is unfair.
- He will be putting forth a ballot measure that would prohibit any member or representative [of the Mayor's office or Board of Supervisors] from contacting any Commissioner about any particular project.
- This would allow departments to be totally independent.
- The Board controls the department through budget means.
Francisco De Costa
- He agrees with the previous speaker.
- The interim Director has a lot to do.
- There is a lack of environmental impact assessment at the Planning Department.
- The Commission needs to work very closely with Building Inspection, Redevelopment Agency, etc.
- An audit should be done on the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency.

Preliminary Recommendation: Do Not Take Discretionary Review and Approve the Project.
(Continued from Regular Meeting of December 2, 2004)
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Steve Williams - Representing One Discretionary Review Requestor
- The lot in question does not appear in any of the Sanborn maps.
- The project does not have a rear yard.
- The other lot is substandard.
- The department would have given a different recommendation if staff had had the entire information.
- This project should be returned for re-analysis.
- The Building Department reports also gives information that is not correct.
- There is no need to rush through this project.
(-) William Marconi - 2ndDiscretionary Review Requestor
- The project would result in a tiny house and would decrease the value of the neighborhood.
- It would gravely affect the light and views of the house on the southeast corner of Stanyan Street.
- The project would also result in a loss of open space.
(-) Pennie Sempell
- She lives on Stanyan Street.
- She was denied vehicle access to her property.
- She was also denied fire access to the rear of her house.
- She is concerned about the legality of the construction.  The project will take away a parking area for people that don't have a garage.  The project infringes open space in the area.
(-) Oleg Obuhoff
- He is not against the variance.
- There are some questions about the true owner of the property.  There has been information that the property was either transferred or sold.
- Most of the neighbors would like to preserve the open space.
(-) David Weill
- He lives on Mountain Spring Street.
- He is opposed to the project because it is out of character with the single family dwelling structures in the area.
- There is a lot of traffic in the area because of UC Med.
- The driveway will take away some of the parking.
- He moved into his home in 1971.
- Before 1971, there was construction done to a home and there was water running out of the house.  There is still water running out of the house so he is worried that another construction will make things worse.
(-) Tav Matulla
- She and her husband have lived in the area for many years.
- She is against the project because it is very massive.
- There are many issues with this project that need to be dealt with before the project is allowed to move forward.

- He is concerned with the project with the same issues as the previous speakers.
- He is extremely concerned about the negative tactics that the project sponsor has done.
(-) George Matulla
- There are a lot of discrepancies with the reports.
- The land maps are contrary to what is actually in the neighborhood.
(-) Terry Senne
- He lives on Stanyan Street.
- He joins his neighbors opposing this project.
- If there was a project that would be built to the detriment of the neighborhood it would be this one.
(-) Cathleen Clark
- She lives in one of the houses of the Stanyan Street steps.
- She is opposed to the project because there has been a lot of deceit and dishonesty.

- There is no vehicular access to their homes.  If this project is built with a driveway it would remove space for people to park their cars.
(-) Leigh Sealy
- This has been on the minds of the neighbors for many months.
- Open space, parking, nature of the hill, water that rushes down the hill are all the concerns that neighbors have.
- He would be most encouraged if the Commission would reconsider this project.
(-) Doris Linnenbach
- He agrees with the representative of the Discretionary Review requestor--this is not a simple project.  This project cannot be "rubber stamped" for approval.
- All the people who spoke would not come here if there were no real concerns.
(-) Dennise Lapointe - Twin Peaks Improvement Association
- The association has taken the stand to oppose this project because there are serious problems.
- She submitted a letter with the issues of why they are opposed.
(+) C.J. Healy - Ruben and Junius - Representing Project Sponsor
- This is a very well designed project.
- This is not a "City giveaway" project.
- The lot is not substandard.  The lot is about the same size as nearly every lot on Clarendon Avenue.
- The project meets all the requirements of the Planning Code.
- The issue of deceit, which was spoken about, is simply not true.
- The project sponsor was very open about everything they have tried to do with the project.
- The project is actually a very attractive one.
(+) Mark Brand - Project Developer
- He displayed a diagram of the proposed project.
- They have made quite a number of good neighbor gestures.
- He displayed another diagram showing how the house would not cause shadows to the adjacent house and how the light wells help with brining sun to the house.
(+) Joe O'Donaghue
- The question is that the project is conforming to the code.
- Parking and open space is an issue of every development no matter what neighborhood.
- There are issues for various agencies of the City.
- This is a typical San Francisco case.

(+) Amy Adamson - Project Architect
- The home is in great disrepair.
- The use of two independent units is very poor.
- The mechanical and plumbing systems are substandard.  The acoustic separations are substandard since there is no insulation.  There is no heat in one unit. One of the bedrooms does not have a closet.  To go into another room one has to go through the kitchen, etc.
(+) John Barbey - Liberty Hill Neighborhood Association
- He lives on the same street.
- The subject project is like the anchor house of the neighborhood.
- The house has very nice architecture but requires a lot of work.
