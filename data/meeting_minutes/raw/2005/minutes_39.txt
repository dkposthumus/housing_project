- I remember very distinctly that Commissioner Hughes talked about the fact that, that particular project came before you and had community support and strengthened the sense of that particular block.That's already a mixed-use and will create a sense of community and enhance that sense.And that's the reason why this Commission approved that 71-unit project.
ACTION:Meeting held. Informational Only.No formal action.But by consensus through deliberation, the Commission directed staff to go and prepare a set of controls that they [the Commission] can react to and possibly begin initiation on – whether it's interim that turns into controls or policies – just go back and put that together.

- I remember very distinctly that Commissioner Hughes talked about the fact that, that particular project came before you and had community support and strengthened the sense of that particular block.That's already a mixed-use and will create a sense of community and enhance that sense.And that's the reason why this Commission approved that 71-unit project.
ACTION:Meeting held. Informational Only.No formal action.But by consensus through deliberation, the Commission directed staff to go and prepare a set of controls that they [the Commission] can react to and possibly begin initiation on – whether it's interim that turns into controls or policies – just go back and put that together.
