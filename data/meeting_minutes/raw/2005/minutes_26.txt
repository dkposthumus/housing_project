The proposed modifications would change conditions of approval (1) related to the Below Market Rate (BMR) units, to allow them to be sold rather than restricting them to rental tenure only and (2) to "un-bundle" the residential parking spaces (to allow units to be sold without parking spaces).This project is within an NC-3 District and an 80-A Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation:Approval w/conditions to "un-bundle" parking and Disapproval of ownership tenure for BMR units.
