5.  Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Antonini:
Re:  Ordinance from Board of Supervisors
- There was an ordinance passed which requires self-breathing replenishment systems in high rise buildings for permits issued after March 30, 2004.
- There seems to be some question about when this ordinance will be implemented.
- He will contact DBI to get more information because this could be applied to the Rincon Hill projects.
Re:  Letter from Ms. Azalia Merrill
- She did an extensive search for below market rate units.
- How are below market rate units being noticed?
- How are people chosen to qualify for these units?
- How does one verify the income level of the people that are chosen?00
Re:  399/375 Fremont Street
- His feeling is that the Commission expressed an interest that an Environmental Impact Report reflects the possibility that if a one tower option is analyzed that the impact could be analyzed up to a height of 450 feet.
Commissioner Olague:
Re:  724 Van Ness Avenue
- She call for a public hearing on this project.
Commission Secretary responded:
- Any Commissioner can make a request, but if the request does not come from the Commission President, then she needs to have a consensus of the other Commissioners on the matter.
Commissioner Hughes:
Re:  724 Van Ness Avenue
- He supports a review of this project just to have a clear understanding as to jurisdiction and discretion of the Zoning Administrator.
Re:  Stan Warren
- He requested that the meeting be adjourned in memory of Stan Warren.
- He was the recording secretary for the San Francisco Building Trades Council.
Re:  APA Convention
- Are any of the Commissioners scheduled to attend?
Interim Director Macris responded:
- He is trying to work out a plan on the Commissioners attending the conference.
- He will be reporting on this in the near future.
Commissioner Antonini:
Re:  724 Van Ness Avenue
- He feels that this has been discussed on a number of occasions and is satisfied with the determination.
- Is there something that can be reversed at this time and if it can, would it be proper to do it?
- He does not mind hearing the project or discussing it.
City Attorney Stacy responded:
- The Commission does not have any jurisdiction over the permit.
- The Zoning Administrator's determinations are before the Board of Appeals.
Commissioner Bradford Bell:
Re:  724 Van Ness Avenue
- She does not feel that this should be brought back before the Commission.
Commissioner W. Lee:
Re:  724 Van Ness Avenue
- He is in agreement to bring this case back before the Commission.
- He would like to have the project sponsor come and explain things to them because there is enough public concern about this project.
Commissioner Hughes:
Re:  Rincon Hill Plan
- He knows that the purpose of this motion was to essentially "carve" out two projects that were in the pipeline and to set time aside when it could be reviewed.
Commissioner Bradford Bell:
Re:  Broadcast
- She is glad that the Commission will be on TV again.
Interim Director Macris responded:
- It is true that the Commission will be broadcasted again.
Commission Alexander:
Re:  724 Van Ness
- Since the Commission does not have any jurisdiction over this project, he does not agree that it should come back before the Commission.
Commissioner Sue Lee:
Re:  Interface with the Planning Commission and the Zoning Administrator's Role

6. Director's Announcements
Interim Director Macris Reported:
Re:  Audit Committee
- He attended the Audit Committee on Monday to discuss the Chinatown Economic Development Group.  There is still $58,000 to be accounted for.  He is working toward a resolution of this.
7. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
Zoning Administrator reported:
BOS -
RE:  Appeal of 616 Divisadero (Harding Theatre)
- This item was continued to March 16 because there was an Appeal of the Negative Declaration, which did not allow the Conditional Use appeal to be heard.  The item was continued to March.
BOA -
Re:  4001 Mission Street
- The Board approved this project per the project sponsor's submittals--which was what the Commission had approved.
Re:  567 Sanchez Street
- This case has been around for several years.
- The adjacent neighbor settled the case so the Commission could "bless" the agreement with the neighbors.
- When the permit came through there were some changes, which were actually quite significant.
- The Board did not overturn the permit.
Re:  Letter of Determination
- These have started to be posted on the Department's website.
Commissioner Antonini:
Re: 567 Sanchez Street
-  If a complaint is brought, could it be brought to him [the Zoning Administrator] for a ruling or go to the Board of Appeals?
Zoning Administrator Badiner Responded:
- When a Commission approves a project and there is still further work to be done, staff reviews these plans and go to him only if the plans are completely different from what was approved by the Commission.  He then issues a letter of determination, which could be appealed at the Board of Appeals.

The property is within an RH-3 (Residential, House, Three-family) District, and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation:  Take Discretionary Review and approve the project with conditions.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Cris Gardner - Discretionary Review Requestor
- She submitted a letter from the other Discretionary Review requestor since she had to leave.
- The proposed project is higher than allowed so it does not conform to the mid block open space.
They have worked with the project architect and have come to some agreement.
- The project significantly impacts the character of the neighborhood.
- This is bordering on excessive but acceptable to them.
- The expandable building envelope should be contained now and in the future.
- There is quite a bit of open space right now.
- She displayed a photograph of a house showing the type of architecture in the neighborhood.
- She is asking for a continuance to revisit issues that have not been resolved or to take discretionary review and adopt the conditions that they are suggesting.
(-) Bill Canahan
- His family owns a home on Carolina Street.
- He appreciates that the project sponsor has not requested the tallest height allowed, because there are still things that need to be discussed.

(-) Dorothy Larson
- She lives on Carolina Street.
- She displayed a photograph of the street showing the homes on the hill.
- There has always been a yard next to the property.

- He knows that the project is appropriately scaled.
- There is a very large park right across the street.  The issue of the neighbors not having open space is unfounded.
- The project meets the Planning Code.
- This project is sensibly designed so issuing a Notice of Special Restrictions would restrict the project a lot.

1598 DOLORES STREET- northwest corner of 29thStreet; Lots 40 through 52, inclusive, in Assessor's Block 6618 -Request for Conditional Useauthorization to modify conditions of approval set forth in Planning Commission Motion Number 16445 as modified by Board of Supervisors Motion Number M02-163 and relating to Planning Department Case Number 2000.1058C to allow payment of an in-lieu affordable housing fee rather than provide on-site affordable housing, pursuant to inclusionary housing policies set forth in Planning Commission Resolution Number 16350. In September of 2002, the City authorized construction of two 4-story buildings on the subject property containing a total of 13 units and up to 26 independently accessible off-street parking spaces; both buildings are now complete. Conditions of approval require one of the proposed units to be provided as a Below Market Rate (BMR) unit.

- The intent is to have affordable housing and to have community space for the neighbors to meet.
- He will be able to train the youth of the Mission to work on this project.

- He displayed various pictures of buildings that are old but would not be designated as a Landmark.
- They are similar to the subject project.
- The project was built with poor quality materials and badly constructed.
- The history of the subject building is in the labor units that met there and not into its architecture.
