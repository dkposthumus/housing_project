Commissioner Bradford Bell:
Re:  Death of her nephew
- She thanked the public for their support and condolences for the death of her nephew.
Re:  Planning Commission not being televised

- He is not sure why either but he knows that the Commission Secretary will be researching this information.
Re:  Stan Warren
- She would like to adjourn this meeting in the memory of Stan Warren.

BOA - The Zoning Administrator reported
Re:  23 Eureka

Re:  1244-1268 Sutter Street (Old Regency Theatre)
- There was a proposal to use the building as a fabric design studio.
- There were a lot of people working on computers so he determined it was more of an office activity.

Zoning Administrator Responded:
- There are some significant features that are original to the theatre.

Jackie Brison
525 5thStreet
- There have been a number of complaints about this building.

- This is the most important Commission as far as she is concerned.

Charles Marsteller
Re:  724 Van Ness Avenue
- It is his view that a Conditional Use and a Variance does not exist for the building that the project sponsor intends to build:  130 market-rate and BMR condominiums with 52 parking spaces.
- This bait and switch project subverts the integrity of the Conditional Use process and sets dangerous precedents for others to follow.
- They still believe that the Planning Commission should recall this project for public hearing.
Sue Hestor
Re:  Avalon Ballroom/Regency Theater
- She is concerned that the Zoning Administrator does not submit documents to the Planning Commission.
- If the definition of office is not preserved or identified, then the City Attorney should provide that information.

- She requested that the Commission schedule a new hearing on this matter.
Joe O'Donoghue
Re:  Planning Commission not being televised

- There is no parking control in the area so this is an environmental issue.
- The environmental documents need to deal with reality and not standards.

- He knows the real problems of traffic in the area but this document seems to ignore them.

- There are far more car pedestrian collisions than car bike collisions.
