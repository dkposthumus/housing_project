SPEAKER(S):
(+) Steve Corabiel - Executive Director of Tool Works

(+) David Kremer - San Francisco Little League
- He supports the EIR.  He wants to get redevelopment going on the island.
(+) Peter Thorner - San Francisco Board Sailing Association
- He has been wind surfing for about 10 years.
- The location off the island is perfect for windsurfing.
- He looks forward to the certification of the EIR.
- This would allow for improvements on the island.
(+/-) Ruth Gravanis
- He does not have any problems with the EIR because improvements can be made.
- She only has the following issues for improving the marina:  recycling facilities, readiness program for cleanups, enforcement on signage, availability of a launching facility for kayaks, the Monterrey pines might have to be removed, number of cars in the parking areas, etc.
- She hopes that most of the issues will be addressed accordingly.
(+) Ian Lewis - Local 2 - Hotel Worker's Union
- Approving the EIR will allow for first-rate jobs so he hopes the Commissions will approve the EIR.
(+) Sherry Williams - Executive Director for the Homeless Development Initiative
- They are in favor of the EIR document.
- Quick decisions could prevent the island from becoming a ghost town.
- It is unclear to the public how the Planning Commission is involved in the development of the island.  Before, Gerald Green was on the Development Authority Board.  But there is no representation [from Planning] right now.
- She hopes the EIR is approved.
(-) Eve Back - ARC Ecology
- The document still has a lot of flaws.
- They have taken the position of appealing the EIR because there are still issues to deal with.
- She has concerns with the traffic analysis.
(-) Eugene Brodsky - Citizen's Advisory Board of Treasure Island
- He agrees with the previous speaker.
- There is still the issue of life safety on the island that has not been fully addressed.
- The northwest corner of the island is the most in danger.  If there was an earthquake there would be much devastation.
- How would there be an evacuation if the bridge span were to collapse or be inaccessible?
- The issue of emergency preparedness is the most important issue to be addressed.
- The future of the island needs to be addressed as well.
(+) Jim Salinas - San Francisco Building and Construction Trades Council
- He supports the EIR.
- The document is the start of an effort that will benefit the City and County of San Francisco.
(+) Carisa Harris - Treasure Island Sailing Foundation
- They fully support the EIR.
- Moving the project forward by approving the EIR would benefit them greatly.
C. SPECIAL CALENDAR
1.TRANSFER AND REUSE OF NAVAL STATION TRESURE ISLAND-Certification of the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) -The Environmental Impact Report analyzes the potential environmental impacts of the conveyance of former Naval Station Treasure Island (NSTI) from the U.S. Navy to the Treasure Island Development Authority (TIDA). NSTI includes both Yerba Buena Island and Treasure Island, and is located in Central San Francisco Bay, within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City and County of San Francisco. The EIR also analyzes, as a consequence of conveyance, three reuse alternatives based upon the Reuse Plan for NSTI (1996), which includes a variety of public oriented uses such as sports fields, a film production center, conference center, hotels, a themed attraction, educational and child care facilities, a fire fighter training school, public open space, and up to 2,800 housing units. The EIR also evaluates the expansion of the existing Clipper Cove Marina at a project-level. The Navy has published a separate Final Environmental Impact Statement evaluating the potential environmental effects of the disposal and reuse of NSTI to comply with Federal requirements.
Preliminary Recommendation: Certify Environmental Impact Review
NOTE:The public hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Review is closed. The public comment period for the Draft Environmental Impact Report ended on October 21, 2003. TIDA and the Planning Commission do not conduct public review of Final Environmental Impact Reviews. Public comments on the certification may be presented to TIDA and the Planning Commission during the Public Comment portion of the TIDA - Planning Commission calendar.
