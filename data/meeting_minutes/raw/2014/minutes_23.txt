C.COMMISSION MATTERS
5.Commission Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements.Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Commissioner Antonini:
I noticed in yesterday’s Examiner, I guess either the State or Federal government had released the latest population figures and revealed that San Francisco had grown to the highest number ever, over 837,000, which was an increase of 11,000-12,000, which represent about 1.4 percent in the last year and I think, as we move to build more housing and densification, I think that’s a good thing. However, the one part of it that was a little bit alarming and it would be good for us to try to delve a little deeper is that, while we did have a net increase in terms of Bay Area counties, if you take all of the adjoining counties aggregately, more people left San Francisco for those counties than came from those counties to San Francisco. There were couple counties that were the other way around, but aggregately they were more. So, it would be - - there is no real way to find out, but it would be very instructional if we had a way to find people who had left San Francisco for housing in an adjoining county, obviously are not transferred across the country, it’s a move that other factors are involved, many are economic, of course, but there are probably a lot of them that have to do with quality of life, perceived issues around crime, or the quality of schools, or traffic or other things that people may object to and also, one thing that we are short on is, units have that have three or more bedrooms. I think we only have about 20 percent of our housing stock, and obviously, there are cases that are hybrids where someone probably could afford a one bedroom, but the couple has two children, it’s pretty unrealistic to stay in San Francisco, and have to buy or rent a one bedroom apartment. Anyway, it would be very instructive, if there is a way to find out what the breakdown of the number of bedrooms per unit is in the other large cities in America. I would expect, since they have a lot more single-family homes in other cities, probably they have a lot more than 20 percent, three bedroom units, it’s something that we seriously have to look at, if we can increase the number relative to our housing stock.
Commissioner Richards:
A couple of things, last week I was struck a little bit, by folks that were coming up during public comment and saying, especially on the large project at 490 South Van Ness, you don’t really understand, you’re approving this project, this is a project, but there other projects in the neighborhood, there is a cumulative effect that is happening, please try to understand that. I went back; I served on the Market-Octavia CAC until I came here, on the Commission. I went back and I actually found maps that staff had presented to us, because we have the same questions, and I would think that maybe on the large projects, Alexis was able to pull this together for us, we can maybe have that information as well, because it actually points where the location is of the project and how many market rate units there are, so it puts really the project in context, rather than just have, we’re dealing with the project, but also can see contextually what it’s doing. I’d really ask that maybe we can add that for the larger projects, it seems fairly easy to do.The second one came up last week, I asked a question around what was the car ownership rate and it was the 26thand Clement project and nobody knew. I actually went back and asked Director Rahaim and he pointed me to Aksel Olson, was able to go into the Community Survey Census, and he said it was fairly easy because I went back to ask him about it. I guess to Commissioner Antonini’s point, it’s an incredibly rich trove of data, not only talks about percent ofrenters, percent of renters with cars, percent of owners, percent of owners with cars, it talks about the number of bedrooms, how people commute to work, incredibly contextual for some of these projects, for what we are asking for, asking for increased entitlements. I asked Jonas to actually copy the report for the Telegraph Hill project, that was my example, and want him to pass it out to the Commissioners, that would be great. So, those are a couple of things that really help me to make better decisions because there’s more data, I don’t want to get bogged down in data, but I’d like to get the context of what we’re approving these projects in.
6.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Thank you.Just if I may, just to respond briefly to Commissioner Richards, we were happy to provide that, absolutely, that would be fine. And the one thing, the American Community Survey, is something that is a relatively new process, that the Census Bureau conducts, in-lieu of the old long form, if you remember historically there was short form and a certain percentage of people, I can’t remember, 10 percent, I think got the long form, they replaced that with a survey, which is not directly a census itself, but it is based on other factors, like moving vans and also sorts of other information that they collect. My only word of caution is, it’s good information, my only word of caution is, that staff sometimes believe that the accuracy is not as good as it should be.
7.Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission

FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
·140283 Planning Code - Rezoning McCoppin Plaza to Public Use/Open Space[1].Passed its FINALread.
INTRODUCTIONS:
·140962 Kim.Hearing requestingpresentations from the San Francisco Unified School District, Planning Department, and Controller’s Office on residential development pipeline projections, enrollment projections, and related educational and school infrastructure needed to accommodate new student enrollment due to increased residential development.City and School District Select Committee.
·140954 Wiener.Exceptions from Dwelling Unit Density Limits and from Other Specified Code Requirements.Ordinance amending the Planning Code to permit exceptions from dwelling unit density limits and other requirements of the Code when adding Dwelling Units to existing buildings undergoing seismic retrofitting; deleting the requirement that a new In-Law Unit constructed in and near the Castro Street Neighborhood Commercial District be limited to 750 square feet; correcting outdated cross-references and Code language.
·140951 Kim, Avalos, Campos, Chiu, and Mar.Interim Moratorium on Production, Distribution, and Repair Conversion in the Proposed Central South of Market Plan Area.Ordinance approving an interim zoning moratorium to prohibit the conversion or replacement of Production, Distribution, and Repair uses in the proposed Central South of Market Plan Area bounded by Market Street on the north, Townsend Street on the south, 2nd Street on the east, and 6th Street on the west, for 45 days
BOARD OF APPEALS:
Zoning Administrator Scott Sanchez:
The Board of Appeals did meet last night. There are two items that might be of interest to the Commission. The first was an appeal of a rear yard variance that I had granted for 132 Corbett Avenue. This is a through lot, between Corbett and 17th. The proposal was to build a new single-family dwelling at the rear of the lot facing 17thStreet. The appeal was from a neighboring property. The Board ultimately upheld the variance that was granted, no building permit has been filed yet, but I would assume that once the neighborhood notification goes out for that, it will be before you as a discretionary review.The second item is 280 Union Street. This was replacing in-kind a roof deck, which had existed at least, since 1988, but was removed to do roof repairs. The property is somewhat unique in that there is a history of complaints on this property between this and the adjacent property. Over the past three or four years the Department of Building Inspection, between complaints made by one neighbor against the other, and the other neighbor against the other, there have been 26 complaints probably about 200 hours of DBI staff time, also probably close to 100 hours of Planning Department staff time and the nature of the complaints have been legalization of property line windows that have been in place for probably some 20 years, also, the replacing of the roof. I think there was even a complaint that the form board for the foundation had not been removed from one building. When the property owner tried to get access to the site, to remove that, the neighboring property owner who made the complaint, refused access to remove that form board, so, I think that NOV remains unresolved.The Board expressed some frustration and concern about the staff resources that have been spent over the years on a case like this and I think this Commission may share those kinds of concerns.I don’t think it’s been before this Commission, but it had been before the HPC, which heard an appeal of an administrative C of A, but otherwise, hopefully we won’t have any other cases related to this property and I am available for any questions.
