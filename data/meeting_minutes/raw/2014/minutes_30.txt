Commissioner Antonini:
I would like to wish everybody a Happy Hanukkah, Merry Christmas, Happy Kwanza and a Happy New Year and I am very pleased at the last hearing of our year, we have in the calendar three projects that I think all purport to do some great things for San Francisco in the future and very good way to end this year and begin, what I hope to be an even better and exciting 2015.
Commissioner Moore:
I ask that we please close the day in memory of Jennifer Matz. We tried to remember that last week, now with the memorial behind us. We are losing a remarkably inspiring person and I hope you would all join me in memorializing her.I have two other issues: I am very pleased to hear two press releases one on the expansion of the wholesale produce market with a very strong plan to move into the future. I would ask the Department to give us a presentation of how it's moving forward, how it fits into the Eastern Neighborhood Plans and how it addresses the ever present issue of PDR; PDR retention and expansion.The second thing, I was very happy to hear, particularly after we had a very tough special meeting a few weeks ago, Mayor Lee announced that $5.5 million gift from Kaiser Permanente to support community health organizations. This came as a bright light particularly in light of our own tough discussion on that subject matter and I think those were my issues for today.

5.Director’s Announcements
Director Rahaim:
Good afternoon, Commissioners a couple of announcements just to bring to your attention. The first is that we’ll be entering early next year into your annual series of meetings on the budget – on the Department’s budget, what you have on today’s packet is an update on the current budget fiscal year, the budget situation of this fiscal year as well as the process for next fiscal year. We will be having hearings at both Planning Commission and Historic Preservation Commission in January to start that process and the budget is due to the Mayor in, by the end of February. Secondly, in the written Director's report there is the quarterly pipeline, the residential pipeline you'll notice the numbers in the pipeline are continuing to increase from previous quarters and I also point out that the Department’s new applications coming into the Department are continuing at a nearly record pace, particularly for smaller projects. There is a substantial increase in the smaller projects as they are coming forward and my thought is that it’s probably due to the low interest rates as well as the desire to renovate existing buildings rather than move just because of the cost of real estate in San Francisco right now. Thirdly, just wanted to point out I believe you received an e-mail from Gina Simi, our Communications Director that the annual report, the Commission’s and the Department’s Annual Report, is out on our website. We will be getting you hard copies in the next couple of weeks, but it is a now available on the Department’s website the fiscal year 2013-2014 annual report on the Department’s website with that, I'll close by wishing you a happy holiday and see you next year.

T-THIRD PHASE 3 CONCEPT STUDY–Informational Presentation, the Central Subway Light Rail line, also known as the T-Third Phase 2, will begin operating in early 2019, providing rail service as far north as Washington Street in Chinatown. At the request of Supervisor David Chiu and community members interested in the possibility of preserving corridor rights-of-way for a potential extension project, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Authority (SFMTA), Transportation Authority, and Planning Department recently conducted the  T-Third Phase 3 Concept Study to evaluate continuing rail service further north to North Beach and Fisherman’s Wharf. This high-level technical feasibility study evaluated the potential benefits, costs and constructability of alternative alignments in three sample corridors. The study finds that several concepts are technically feasible, and most score in the highest category of the Federal Transit Administration’s cost effectiveness measures. All-underground concepts have the greatest benefits and remain cost effective despite higher costs. The study does not recommend a specific alternative or next steps, but is intended to inform several upcoming planning efforts which will consider this potential project in the context of other local and regional transit investment priorities.
