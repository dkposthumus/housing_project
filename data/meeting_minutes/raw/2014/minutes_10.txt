C.COMMISSION MATTERS
10.Commission Comments/Questions
·Inquiries/Announcements.Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).
·Future Meetings/Agendas.At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.
Jonas Ionin, Commission Secretary:
Commissioners, I just want to follow up on the matter that was raised at last week's hearing by Commissioner Moore regarding Conditions of Approval at 1433 Bush Street. Specifically, I went back and re-reviewed that hearing tape and indeed the staff presenter, Glenn Cabreros, did indeed read the amendment regarding the on-site affordability component into the record during his presentation, so I just wanted to follow up with all you and members of the viewing audience.
Commissioner Antonini:
Yeah, interesting article that will be pertinent, I think, for our discussion that follows and it was in the New York Times on Sunday, June 8th and it dealt with affordable housing in New York City and the system there is different than what we have here. It’s a voluntary system. If the builder/sponsor does agree to it, they have to provide 20 percent affordable and in return they get 33 percent more square footage. It appears to not be very popular because only 3,000 units have been built in New York City between 2005 and 2013. I guess, only 2,000 or 3000 affordable units. There's a state law in New York on density, so that’s another factor, but one of the reasons that it was felt there hasn't more built, that it too expensive to build those units at that high affordability level and that most sponsors opt not to do it.So anyway, just interesting we'll be discussing similar matters later on today.
Commissioner Sugaya:
Yes, to staff, could we get a report I don't know if action was taken, but the City was considering selling property at the 100 Folsom project and I was wondering whether there was any increase in the affordability percentage associated with that, since it was City property, that’s going to a private developer.

LAND USE COMMITTEE:
·140236 Planning Code - Mission Alcoholic Beverage Special Use District. Sponsor: Campos.This Ordinance would amend the Mission Alcoholic Beverage SUD to allow mini-golf courses that are functionally and/or physically integrated with a Restaurant use to obtain liquor licenses.This Commission heard this item onMay 22, 2014, and recommended approval of the proposed Ordinance with the following modifications:
•Modifying subsection (b)(1)(C) so that the uses “bowling alleys” and “mini-golf courses” are replaced with “Other Entertainment uses that do not require a Place of Entertainment Permit.”
•Clarifying that the uses listed under subsection (b)(1), which includes bona-fide eating establishments, are allowed new, original ABC licenses
Supervisor Campos did not amend the Ordinance to include the Commission’s first recommendation, because of community concerns over the proliferation of alcohol establishment sin the district; however, Supervisor Wiener felt that that Commission’s recommendation was appropriate and would allow other entertainment uses to open in the Mission District without having to introduce another Ordinance.The Committee voted to include the Commission’s first recommendation, which meant that the Ordinance had to be continued for one week before it could be voted on and sent to full Board for adoption.
140414 General Plan - Repealing Ordinance No. 108-11 - Adoption of 2009 Housing Element (Mohan, Dischinger)The 2009 Housing Element was heard at the Land Use Committee. The 2009 Housing Element is currently under litigation as a result of a lawsuit by San Franciscans for Livable Neighborhoods, an association of neighborhood groups, who challenged the 2004 and 2009 Housing Element EIR and the adoption of the 2009 Housing Element in the San Francisco Superior Court. The Court ordered the City to set aside its certification of the EIR and reconsider the approval of the 2009 Housing Element.  The commission heard this item on March 27, 2014 at its initiation and again at the April 24, 2014 hearing to recommend its adoption. The item was forwarded to the full board to be heard on June 17, 2014 without recommendation due to the pending CEQA appeal filed by the Petitioners. (I think the CEQA appeal prevents the board from making a recommendation)
FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:
5/27/14
·Designation of 1007 Market Street (aka James G. Walker Building).This item proposes to change the Article 11 designation for 1007 Market Street from a Category V (Unrated) building to a Category III (Contributory) building.

BOARD OF APPEALS:
Jonas Ionin, Commission Secretary:
Commissioners, Zoning Administrator, Scott Sanchez is not in attendance, but he did forward his Board of Appeals report to me.There are two items that maybe of interest to the Planning Commission.The first is 740 Bay Street.The appeal was related to the addition of features to a previously approved roof deck including fire pit, barbeque and planters.The appellant argued that they did not receive notice of the roof- deck, however, the roof-deck was the subject of a DR filed by the appellant that was heard by the Planning Commission in January of 2013.At that hearing the Commission modified the project to require opaque windows on a proposed 3rdfloor addition, but did not modify or restrict the roof deck.The Board of Appeals voted to deny the appeal and uphold the permit.The second is 518 Castro Street.This appeal was related to a lease of suspension for permit that authorized a pharmacy and medical service use.The pharmacy had previously been identified as the Aids Health Care Foundation Pharmacy, which is a formula retail use.The permit holder subsequently revised the project to identify the use as the Castro Pharmacy, which does not maintain two or more standardized features and is not categorized as a formula retail use.The Planning Code states that the permit holder bears the burden of proof to the City that they are not a formula retail use.The Board of Appeals continued the item to August 20, 2014, and required the permit holder submit additional information to justify their claim, that they would not operate as a formula retail use.During this time, the permit holder could still seek a CU for formula retail use to allow the AHF Pharmacy at the property.
