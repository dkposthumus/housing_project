1-6 MEACHAM PLACE- Meacham 
    Place is a narrow, dead-end alley between Hyde and Larkin in Assessor’s Block 
    302, access is from Post Street.  The project is a consideration of a proposal 
    to install an iron swing gate at the entrance of Meacham Place.  The project 
    would also involve the installation of planter boxes along the sidewalks and 
    back wall of the alley.
Preliminary 
    Recommendation: Find that proposal is not in conformity with the General Plan.
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Denise Rosser
- This proposal has been around 
    for many years.
- The purpose of the gate is not 
    for private use; it is for safety.  The street is a dead-end street and there 
    has been a lot of illegal activity going on.
- They just want a gate to ensure 
    their safety.
- Every building on the street has 
    installed exterior lighting; the neighbors clean the street themselves, and 
    have put gates on windows.  They have tried every measure to have the street 
    be safer.
- There is no reason for a service 
    vehicle to get into the street.  The parked cars that are there block their 
    home access.
- She would like to have the Commission 
    really look at the proposal and approve the project.
(+) Captain Kevin Dillon – Commanding 
    Office – Police Department
- Despite their best efforts they 
    have been unable to control the illegal activity on the street.  Unfortunately, 
    their proximity to the Tenderloin makes it difficult to control.
- Although there are other issues 
    regarding the Fire Department, which he can't provide comment on, he feels 
    that their only answer for safety it gating off the street.
(+) David Overdorf
- When they asked for maintenance 
    of the street or paving, the City mentioned that the service vehicles would 
    not be able to get in or out of the street.
- Now that they want a gate installed, 
    the City decides that it cannot approve this because it's a street for public 
    use.
- The neighbors have tried everything 
    to make this street safe.
- The City said that the neighbors 
    are responsible for paving it.  Everyone is happy to do so but why are they 
    responsible for this but can't put a gate up because they are tired of the 
    illegal activity?
- This problem is quite severe.  
    He displayed pictures of how some cars park on the sidewalk and block their 
    gates and doors.  They have called police to have these cars towed yet during 
    the late hours the police have limited staff.
(+) Eric Rosser
- He lives on this street with his 
    family.  He was born and raised in San Francisco.
- There has been a deterioration 
    of the standard of living for many people.
- The area has an incredible amount 
    of illegal activity going on which has become intolerable.
- They would like the Commission 
    to make a decision that would improve the City.
- It is a very dangerous place for 
    him and his family to live.
(+) Richard Mayer
- He supports the installation of 
    the gate.
- One of his employees was assaulted 
    and robbed on this alley.  They have established a policy that their employees 
    not walk the alley by themselves.
- His concern is that a car could 
    hurt an individual, who cannot be seen.
- There is a very large, high-pressure 
    gas line for his company and there have been a lot of individuals starting 
    bonfires on the street.
ACTION:Found that the proposal is not in conformity with the General 
    Plan. The proposal to gate the alley was disapproved.

678 PORTOLA DRIVE- between 
    Sidney Way and Woodside Avenue; Lot 004 in Assessor’s Block 2892.  Request 
    for Conditional-Use Authorization pursuant to Section 209.6(b) of the Planning 
    Code to install a total of nine antennas and a base transceiver station on 
    an existing church building as part of Nextel's wireless telecommunications 
    network in an RH-1 (D)(Residential, House, Single-Family, Detached) District 
    and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation: Approval 
    with conditions
SPEAKER(s)
(+) Molly Gills – Nextel Communications
- This site is needed to fill in the coverage gap when Nextel 
    removes antenna from Sutro Tower.
- The equipment will not be visible.
- The equipment will not cause interruption to televisions, 
    cordless phones, etc.
- There were community meetings at the church and 7 people 
    attended.
- A public notice was sent to neighbors regarding this meeting.
(+) Alicia Duke
- The Nextel project happens to be in use and hopefully will 
    be used soon.
- The manager of the San Francisco branch has tried every type 
    of possible phone there is and Nextel has proven to have a  no dead  zone.
- She hopes that this project will be approved.
- This would benefit the elderly and disabled.
(-) Elizabeth Mettling – Miraloma Park Improvement Club
- The church has a nursery school in the basement.
- This type of equipment is not allowed on schools so why is 
    it allowed on this building?
- Tower Market has equipment so she doesn't understand why 
    this is considered a  dead zone.
- The equipment should not be allowed near children.
(-) Olie Kauffman
- His house is across the street from the church.
- It's a single-family residence; if Nextel would come to his 
    house, would the Commission allow that to happen (install their antenna on 
    it)?
- There is still scientific research that this type of equipment 
    is hazardous to health.
- He never received any calls or any documents regarding 
    this meeting.  He found out about it through neighbors.
ACTION No. 1:There was a motion for the project to 
    be continued.  It failed to move forward because it did not receive a second.

NEIGHBORHOOD PRESENTATION OF PROPOSED 
    COW HOLLOW NEIGHBORHOOD DESIGN GUIDELINES– Presentation and discussion 
    of proposed Cow Hollow Neighborhood Design Guidelines.
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Brooke Sampson – Neighborhood Design Guidelines Committee Chair
She provided an introduction and outline of the neighborhood 
    presentation that included the following:
- The goals are to present proposed Cow Hollow Neighborhood 
    Design Guidelines (CHNDG) to the San Francisco Planning Commission and Staff.
- To secure acceptance of the CHNDG by the Planning Commission 
    as  Interim Design and Planning Guidelines  and as being reflective of neighborhood 
    character as defined by the Cow Hollow Association.
- To have the Planning Commission instruct Planning Department 
    staff to review development projects in the Cow Hollow neighborhood against 
    the recommendations and policies of the CHNDG, and when appropriate, to insure 
    preservation of neighborhood character through the use of the Planning Commission's 
    discretionary authority (DR).
- Fairness and balance in preserving neighborhood character 
    and property rights by applying the concept of equalization.
The items that will be covered are as follows:
Â·Background 
    and history of CHNDG preparation and level of neighborhood involvement
Â·Understanding 
    the process for adoption of Neighborhood Character Districts
Â·Presentation 
    of the Cow Hollow Neighborhood Design Guidelines
Â·Brief comment 
    by neighborhood representatives
Â·Respond to 
    Commission Questions
(+) Lou Blazej
- Zoning districts in the Cow Hollow Neighborhood (CHN) include: 
    RH-1 (D); RH-1 and RH-2; RM-1, 2 and 3.
- Neighborhood character involves architectural mass, scale, 
    rhythm design and environmental characteristics.
- Research confirms that the neighborhood character is based 
    primarily on building scale and lot coverage.
- Analysis of the CHN rear yard open space is very important 
    to the neighborhood character.
- Recommended Policies: Specific policies included in the CHNDG: 
    rear yards (45% rear yard open space); equalization (rear yard policy: equalization 
    to the more complying neighbor where adjacent neighbors exceed standard); 
    height (height policy: uniform height policy. The height policies for Cow 
    Hollow are based on the following lot slope configurations: level, steep up-sloping 
    lots, steep down-sloping lots)
- Other Elements of the Design Guidelines: Texture and Detailing 
    (exterior materials/ ornamentation); Openings (entryways and windows); Landscaping 
    (pruning trees; tree selection and placement for views).
- The current zoning regulations will not protect Cow Hollow 
    character and environmental quality.  Unless something is done, the quality 
    of life in Cow Hollow will continue to erode.
- Needed actions: adoption of the Design Guidelines and zoning 
    changes.
(+) Sidney Unobskey
- He thanked all of the people who were at the hearing from 
    Cow Hollow to support the design guidelines and asked the Commission to support 
    them.
(+) Brook Simpson
- Finally, the CHN would like the Commission and staff to further 
    review the CHNDG document and consider the CHN request for acceptance of the 
    CHNDG.
- Have this matter calendared within the next three to four 
    weeks for a public hearing and potential action by the Planning Commission.  
    The action would accept the CHNDG as reflecting neighborhood character as 
    defined by the CHN, and instruct Planning Department staff to reference these 
    guidelines in reviewing projects, for projects that are subject to the Commission's 
    discretionary authority, and otherwise as appropriate, to insure preservation 
    of neighborhood character.
ACTION:Meeting held.  No action required by 
    the Commission.   However, staff is to report back in a couple of weeks with 
    a status report on adopting design guidelines and addressing the zoning changes.
F.         SPECIAL DISCRETIONARY REVIEW HEARING

Preliminary Recommendation:Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project as proposed.
(Continued from Regular Meeting of February 22, 2001)
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Frank (last name unclear)
- He is representing Lina Fernando.
- The proposed addition is not in conformance with the residential design guidelines.
- He displayed some photographs and an enlarged list of the homes built by John 
    Kambie.
- The concern is that all of the homes, which are adjacent, have similar rooflines.  
    If any of these homeowners decide to build an expansion the character of the 
    neighborhood would change.
- There are various neighbors who are against this project.
- Read a letter from a neighbor who is against the project.
- The project topography will change also.
(-) James Freeman
- He lives three houses down from the proposed project.  He has lived in San 
    Francisco for many years.

- He is against the addition.
- Other neighbors mentioned to him to state that they are not in agreement either.

- The homes have an architectural consistency on Potrero Hill.
- The character and the beauty of the neighborhood would change if this project 
    is approved.
- Why would someone who has a large family purchase a 2 bedroom home?
- How can a family who is new to their neighborhood dictate what they should 
    accept or not.
- Please don't allow this proposal to pass.
(-) Don Canvey
- He was born on Potrero Hill.
- His dad built the homes on Kansas Street.
- Showed pictures of the homes on Kansas Street.  The street is one of the most 
    unique streets on Potrero Hill.
- The rooflines of these homes are very uniform.
(-) Joe Boston
- He lives on Potrero Hill.
- He understands property rights and the need in the City for homes to be enlarged 
    due to growing families, but in this particular case there is a very uniform 
    architectural character to the street.
- The neighborhood will be affected by Macromedia's project.
-There are other more appropriate ways to increase housing.
(-) Linda Vida
- Her mother lives in the neighborhood that is opposed to the project.
- The project would tower over the homes adjacent to it.
- The project would change the character of the neighborhood.
- The buildings across the street are fairly new and were built to be 4-story 
    houses.
- The planner stated that the neighborhood had no opinion, yet there were meetings 
    with the owner and they stated their concerns.
(+) William Walters – Project Architect
- His office is on Potrero Hill and he has worked there for 15 years.
- He has had to be the middle person.
- He took into account the issues of both sides.
- There is a character to the homes on this street yet there are families who 
    are growing and require more space.
- They did plan to alter the interior to make the home more livable.
- The current bedrooms are quite small.
- He believes that the project is fine as it's designed.
