D.REGULAR CALENDAR
8.2001.0002 ET(SHOTLAND: 558-6308)Amend 
    Planning Code, adding Section 604.1, Requiring Information to be included 
    on General Advertising Signs- Consideration of a proposal to amend 
    the San Francisco Planning Code by adding Section 604.1.  The amendment would  
    require all general advertising signs to bear the name of the sign company, 
    permit number, and permitted sign dimensions.  (Board of Supervisors File 
    No. 002196).Preliminary 
    Recommendation: ApprovalSPEAKER(S):(+) Dee Dee Workman, Executive Director, San Francisco 
    Beautiful-This is the 3rdof three Planning Code amendments 
    that have come before you.-This legislation is an attempt to (manage control) of the explosion 
    of general advertising signs that we have seen in the City for the last several 
    years--particularly those signs going up without a permit.-San Francisco Beautiful supports this action-This will make illegal signs much easier to identify-There is not enough enforcement(-)  Tony Chow-We should look at all sign ordinances altogther and find a 
    solution-Asked the Commission to continue this issue-If the City cracks down on illegal signs, over 70 structures 
    would be permanently removed  from the City's landscape-Commended Supervisor Leon's effort, but this still needs further 
    discussion-Committed to work with the City and address this issue, but 
    requested that they be given a more reasonable time period to work out the 
    details(+) Jean 
    McClatchy-Loves the City and the way it looks-There has been an over exposure of messages we do not need-Applauded Supervisor Leno for having the courage to do something 
    about it-The time for the industry to ask for a continuance so they 
    can think about it some more has passed.-Encouraged the Commission to pass this legislation(-) Steve Chen, Director of Public 
    Affairs for Infinity Outdoors-Why add a penalty of $1,000 per day to the already $500.00 
    per day in civil penalties and $500 per day in criminal fines that are contained 
    in Section 176 of the Planning Code?-This legislation does not contain due process or a remedy for 
    minor infractions.(+) Robert McCarthy-Support the removal of illegal sings-Support the mechanism by which those signs can be identified 
    and easily checked by the department to make sure that they are legal-Support the notion that all these renegade signs will be removed 
    as soon as possible-Asked for a one week continuanceSupervisor Leno-This is a companion to a piece of legislation that this Commission 
    already approved. We want to identify and fine those that are putting up illegal 
    signs--both the company responsible and the building owner that allows it.  
    To help this Department with enforcement, funds collected through these fines 
    will be allocated to them.  We think that by requiring companies to put this 
    very basic information on their signs, we would be able to do it.-Some of the concerns voiced really only represent a very small 
    percentage of what we are addressing here.-We need to move forward-Would like to see this legislation at the Board by the end 
    of AprilACTION:                       AdoptedAYES:Theoharis, Fay,

    is way overdue-It is located 
    in Saint Mary's Square Park-This might 
    be San Francisco's most prominent excavation site-Before someone 
    gets the idea that perhaps the best thing to do with it is to landmark it, 
    we are going to put something useful here.-The housing 
    contribution is over half a million dollars-The transportation 
    contribution is over a quarter of a million dollars-200 new jobs 
    would be created with this project(+) Jeff Heller – project architect-Gave an overall 
    description of the project(+) Dee Workman-It is her understanding that when this project goes up, there 
    will be two long independently standing billboards that are going to come 
    down.  She supports that.(+) Debra Stein-There are 
    not many people who believe that perpetuation of status quote is a better 
    alternative than this project-She supports 
    the project(+) Stan Warren, Represents San Francisco 
    Building and Construction Trade Council-Supports the 
    project-Job are going 
    to be created(+)  Carrol Gilbert-She is a tenant 
    in the building next door-Has worked 
    her entire adult life in that building-She would 
    be very grateful to see that hole go away(+) Sandy Smilloni, Property Manager 
    at 601 Kearny Street-Her only concern 
    is that the Shorestein Company look at the water tower location that will 
    be adjacent to 601 California-During the 
    Saint Mary's retrofit project, we received a lot of fumes that resulted in 
    a lot of indoor air quality issues(+) Ken Cleveland-This project 
    will benefit the entire city of San FranciscoACTION:                       Approved as amended:Revisions to the Motions and conditions of approval, including a

    outstanding urban design, which successfully integrates the restored 150 Powell 
    Street building with the new construction while respecting the surrounding 
    district with respect of height, appearance and scale.-It also provides 
    two and half floors of high quality retail space--which substantially increases

    of available square footage for allocation is not as great as the number of 
    projects that are pending.-Commission

    hearings used on the Downtown Plan where significant. There is a difference 
    between C-3-O and C-3-R-Sunlight is

    one-story warehouse buildings and to construct a new mixed-use building containing 
    62 dwelling units, approximately 29,275 gross square feet of ground floor 
    retail space, approximately 46,775 gross square feet of office space and approximately 
    425 parking spaces on a 42,969 square foot site; approximately 211 of those 
    parking spaces are considered required parking.  The building would contain 
    a total of approximately 342,449 gross square feet of space, including the 
    residential uses, and would be approximately 105 feet in height.   Parking 
    and loading will be accessed from Townsend Street.Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with conditionsSPEAKER(S):(+) Bob McCarthy-Project is right across from the new ballpark and adjacent 
    to two projects approved by the Commission.  Rosenberg's  project is at 169 
    King-It is consistent 
    with the bulk and heights of two near buildings-It is consistent 
    with N-2 zoning, and is consistent with the proposed SCO which has not yet 
    been passed-Gave a description 
    of the project-One of the major concerns of this Commission has been housing.  
    This project creates affordable housing.  It also creates nearly 4 times the 
    amount of required open-There will 
    be retail/office space on King and Townsend-This project 
    will benefit everybody in the neighborhood(+) Bob Mose, Head of Project Team-For over 30 
    years his company has completed projects in key areas around the City–such 
    as the one at King and Townsend-This project 
    would contribute to the Ball Park neighborhood(+) Andreas Skreske, Project Architect-This project 
    is a very important project, not only for what it has to offer the community 
    and the neighborhood, but also for where it is located and who his neighbors 
    are.(+) David Collins, AMCO System Parking-His company 
    intends to manage the parking garage-Urged the 
    Commission to support the project(+) Ken Cleavland, representing, Building Managers and Owners Association-Supports the 
    project because it is obviously a high quality mixed use project in a perfect 
    location-Good project 
    that brings parking to the South of Market that has been lost to new developments(+) John Taltee-Owns property 
    to the south of the proposed project-Property owner 
    consulted with him in regard to the design of this building-Proposed building 
    fits within the neighborhood(-) Sue Hestor-Referred to a letter sent to the Commission protesting the 
    fact that this project is calendared as 177 Townsend Street.  That address 
    has never appeared as the address of this project.  It has been called King-Townsend 
    through the entire process.-The Department 
    needs to be consistent in how it labels projects-Housing components 
    seems to be more of what we have lots of--lofts.-The Planning 
    Commission has the obligation of determining if this is housing-These are no family homes.  These are corporate lofts.ACTION:

Amend 
    Planning Code, adding Section 604.1, Requiring Information to be included 
    on General Advertising Signs- Consideration of a proposal to amend 
    the San Francisco Planning Code by adding Section 604.1.  The amendment would  
    require all general advertising signs to bear the name of the sign company, 
    permit number, and permitted sign dimensions.  (Board of Supervisors File 
    No. 002196).
Preliminary 
    Recommendation: Approval
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Dee Dee Workman, Executive Director, San Francisco 
    Beautiful
-This is the 3rdof three Planning Code amendments 
    that have come before you.
-This legislation is an attempt to (manage control) of the explosion 
    of general advertising signs that we have seen in the City for the last several 
    years--particularly those signs going up without a permit.
-San Francisco Beautiful supports this action
-This will make illegal signs much easier to identify
-There is not enough enforcement
(-)  Tony Chow
-We should look at all sign ordinances altogther and find a 
    solution
-Asked the Commission to continue this issue
-If the City cracks down on illegal signs, over 70 structures 
    would be permanently removed  from the City's landscape
-Commended Supervisor Leon's effort, but this still needs further 
    discussion
-Committed to work with the City and address this issue, but 
    requested that they be given a more reasonable time period to work out the 
    details
(+) Jean 
    McClatchy
-Loves the City and the way it looks
-There has been an over exposure of messages we do not need
-Applauded Supervisor Leno for having the courage to do something 
    about it
-The time for the industry to ask for a continuance so they 
    can think about it some more has passed.
-Encouraged the Commission to pass this legislation
(-) Steve Chen, Director of Public 
    Affairs for Infinity Outdoors
-Why add a penalty of $1,000 per day to the already $500.00 
    per day in civil penalties and $500 per day in criminal fines that are contained 
    in Section 176 of the Planning Code?
-This legislation does not contain due process or a remedy for 
    minor infractions.
(+) Robert McCarthy
-Support the removal of illegal sings
-Support the mechanism by which those signs can be identified 
    and easily checked by the department to make sure that they are legal
-Support the notion that all these renegade signs will be removed 
    as soon as possible
-Asked for a one week continuance
Supervisor Leno
-This is a companion to a piece of legislation that this Commission 
    already approved. We want to identify and fine those that are putting up illegal 
    signs--both the company responsible and the building owner that allows it.  
    To help this Department with enforcement, funds collected through these fines 
    will be allocated to them.  We think that by requiring companies to put this 
    very basic information on their signs, we would be able to do it.
-Some of the concerns voiced really only represent a very small 
    percentage of what we are addressing here.
-We need to move forward
-Would like to see this legislation at the Board by the end 
    of April

(-) Craig Albert
-Stated two 
    concerns that 165 O'Farrel Street has in relation to this new project on the 
    corner of O'Farrel and Powell:
-1.  Property line windows (there are about 28 windows)
-Applicant 
    is proposing to cover all windows. There has not been an effort to work together 
    with tenants
-Request that 
    the Planning Commission require a setback to preserve the windows
-2.  Applicant is requesting a variance on the freight loading, 
    which has been placed directly adjacent to the property at 165 O'Farrel Street
-This will 
    a negative impact on the future potential of this property
(-) Sue Hestor
-Gave a list of pending projects.  She stated that the amount 
    of available square footage for allocation is not as great as the number of 
    projects that are pending.
-Commission 
    should start looking at things competitively in this small building allocation 
    rather than have a potential crisis.
-Number of 
    hearings used on the Downtown Plan where significant. There is a difference 
    between C-3-O and C-3-R
-Sunlight is 
    a great concern. If the streets are not sunny, it is not a pedestrian experience--especially 
    for tourists that come here in Summer

-It is consistent 
    with N-2 zoning, and is consistent with the proposed SCO which has not yet 
    been passed

    This project creates affordable housing.  It also creates nearly 4 times the 
    amount of required open
