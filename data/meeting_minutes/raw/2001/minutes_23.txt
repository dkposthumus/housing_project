      possible modification of or placement of additional conditions per Planning 
      Code Section 303(f) of a prior authorization to allow the establishment 
      of a full-service restaurant and bar, approximately 3,400 square feet in 
      floor area, within the North Beach Neighborhood Commercial District and 
      40-X Height and Bulk District.The 
      proposal is to consider revocation, modification, or placement of additional 
      conditions on a conditional use authorization approved on December 17, 1998, 
      for the conversion of a vacant commercial space, the former Figoni Hardware 
      Store, into a full-service restaurant and bar, per Planning Code Sections 
      722.41 and 722.42.The proposed 
      full-service restaurant and bar is located on the ground floor level of 
      an existing three-story residential over commercial building.The proposal was approved under Building Permit Application No. 
      9912999.There have been unresolved 
      complaints from the community in relation to the construction and operation 
      of the facilities and the possible eviction of residential tenants within

Preliminary Recommendation: 
      Planning Commission to schedule a subsequent hearing to consider the revocation, 
      modification, or placement of additional conditions on the conditional use

      has been designed to be higher than the buildingon the down hill portion of the street, and lower than the building 
      on the up hill portion by 3.9 feet on the left and 1.2' on the right
