 -  
Certification of a Final Environmental Impact Report
:  The State Compensation Insurance Fund (SCIF) proposes to expand their San Francisco office at 1275 Market Street by constructing an adjacent 12-story, approximately 268,000 gross-square-foot (gsf) office building at 55 Ninth Street.  The project site (Assessor's Block 3701, Lot 63) is occupied by a surface parking lot and located mid-block on the northeastern side of Ninth Street in the block bounded by Market, Ninth, Mission, and Eighth Streets in the Mid-Market neighborhood.  The new building would be approximately 198 feet high, including mechanical penthouse, and would have a two-level below-grade parking garage with about 126 parking spaces.  The entrance to the new building and access to off-street parking and loading would be from Ninth Street.  Trucks would enter and exit on Ninth Street and could exit to Laskie Street onto Mission Street.  The project site is zoned C-3-G (Downtown General Commercial) and is within a 120-X Height and Bulk District.  


Preliminary Recommendation:  Certify the Final Environmental Impact Report.  Please note that the public review period for the Draft Environmental Impact Report ended at 5:00 pm, January 27, 2004.

 - 
Request for adoption of CEQA findings and a mitigated negative declaration pursuant to 1) a finding that a net new shadow impact on Union Square Park is not adverse; 2) a Determination of Compliance under Section 309 of the Planning Code to permit an eight-story vertical addition, historic façade restoration, and conversion of an existing office building to a mixed-use project for up to 64 residential dwelling units, up to 73 hotel time-share units, approximately 6,500 square feet of ground level retail space, and a sub grade parking garage (capable of accommodating up to 29 independently-accessible parking spaces and two loading spaces with the capability of accommodating up to 100 vehicles through the use of valet services and vehicle stacking), with exceptions to the Planning Code for the separation of towers requirement, residential open space requirements, publicly-accessible open space requirements, dwelling unit exposure requirements, ground-level wind currents,  independently-accessible parking, sunlight access to sidewalks, and an upper tower extension; 3) a Conditional Use application to allow a hotel in the C-3-O (Downtown, Office) Zoning District;  4) a recommendation to the Board of Supervisors for a General Plan amendment to change the height and bulk district of the existing site; 5) a recommendation to the Board of Supervisors for approval of the creation of the Downtown Housing Demonstration Special Use District encompassing and comprised of the subject property and allowing, among other items, exceptions under Section 309 for residential open space requirements, publicly-accessible open space requirements, and dwelling unit exposure; 6) recommendation to the Board of Supervisors for conditional designation as San Francisco Landmark No. 243 (to be heard at a subsequent Planning Commission hearing date); and 7) recommendation to the Board of Supervisors for conditional approval of a Mills Act Contract (also to be heard at a subsequent Planning Commission hearing date) ; all for the subject property, which is in the C-3-O Zoning District and a 250-S Height and Bulk District.  The proposal is to:


1) Seismically upgrade the subject 16-story office building (The Old Chronicle Building), which would include infilling a large light well at the rear of the building that is not visible from any public right-of-way;


2) Restore the historic building façade by removing a non-historic metal, glass and marble cladding system installed in 1962 and rehabilitating/restoring/reconstructing intact, damaged and missing historic façade features;


3) Construct an eight-story vertical addition that will result in a building height of approximately 312 feet, and a Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of approximately 19.68 if the residential floor space were to be counted toward the FAR calculation as currently required by the Planning Code (see item No. 5 below);


4) Convert the existing office building use to a mixed-use project that would have at least 40, but up to 64 residential dwelling units, at least 49, but up to 73 hotel time-share units (for a combined total of 113 hotel and residential units), approximately 6,500 square feet of ground level retail space, replacing an existing retail bank, and creating a sub grade parking structure, that given the irregular floor plate shape and placement of support columns would yield a maximum of 29 independently-accessible parking spaces and two loading spaces on the project site with the capability of providing up to 100 valet and vehicle-stacking spaces in place of the independently-accessible spaces.  The new parking facility would be accessed through an existing sub grade garage facility at the adjacent 88 Kearny Street property, thereby not requiring a garage entrance at the ground level of the subject 690 Market Street property;


5) In order to construct the addition; infill the light well; implement the proposed change of use; grant exceptions for residential open space, publicly-accessible open space, and dwelling unit exposure under the procedures of Section 309, a new Special Use District is proposed to change the existing height district to a 285-S Height and Bulk District (the Planning Code allows for a 10% increase in height over the height limit under certain criteria, in this case up to 313.5 feet), eliminate residential uses from Floor Area Ratio calculations, and allow said exceptions under Section 309 instead of requiring variances.  The Special Use District would also require a minimum of 15% on-site or 17% off-site Below Market Rate (BMR) units.  The Downtown Element of the General Plan must also be amended as it specifies the height and bulk districts as currently designated within the C-3 zoning districts;


6) The Project Sponsor is proposing to meet the Below Market Rate (BMR) housing requirement by constructing the required BMR units off-site at 938 Market Street, a project that is seeking authorization concurrently with the subject application (2003.0587HXVLU);


7) The project sponsors are seeking to avail themselves of the Mills Act, which allows local governments to grant property tax relief benefits in exchange for the guaranteed preservation of a historic property.  In order to qualify under the San Francisco Administrative Code, the property must either be designated as a San Francisco Landmark or listed separately on the National Register.  As neither condition is the case with the subject property, the project sponsor is seeking conditional San Francisco landmark status.  The proposed Landmark Designation would become final upon the completion of the proposed project consistent with the Rehabilitation Program set forth by the proposed Mills Act contract.


Preliminary Recommendation:  Adopt CEQA findings and mitigated negative declaration.

TH
 AVENUE
 - west side, between Moraga and Lawton Avenues, Lot 021 in Block 1918 - Discretionary Review request, for a building permit (No. 2003.10.16.7721) to allow the construction of a third-story, vertical addition to an existing two-story, two-family dwelling.  The property is located in the RH-1 (Residential, House, Single-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation:  Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the building permit as revised. 


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Lina Radavero


- She has been living in this house since 1960.


- The area was very quiet.


- The addition proposed for this project will impact her life negatively by blocking her sunlight and decreasing the value of her house.


- There are various neighbors who are opposed to this project.


- The parking in the area is terrible already.


(-) Josef Brunner


- He has been living in the Sunset for 50 years.


- The Sunset district is over populated already and this project will allow more people to live there.


- His friend has to park in front of his [Josef's] driveway because there are no parking spaces available.


- The only light that the DR requestor has is not that much.  So allowing this addition will completely block her sunlight.


- He displayed photographs of the DR requestor's home.


(-) Nick Rubinsoff


- In a community such as the Sunset where the houses touch each other, any changes to a house can affect severely the adjacent house.


- Many people would not consider buying a house next to a three-story structure.


- People who buy a house in the Sunset should purchase it with the understanding that the house they are buying should suit their needs.


(-) Amy Li


- She lives close to the proposed house.


- The houses in the neighborhood are old, two-story single-family houses.


- She loves her neighborhood so she wants the houses to keep the same look.


(+) Hogum Menendez - Project Architect


- The guidelines that the Planning Department uses acknowledges the fact that corner lots are treated different than mid block lots, and that they can and should support strong architectural features in neighborhoods such as this one.


- Regarding the illegality of the unit, it actually is legal and they have submitted documentation.


- The room in the back existed before the required date for any kind of permit.  The room is not involved in any permit process.


- There is minimal sunlight impact.


- This proposal has windows that face directly to the rear, they are not oriented towards any of the neighbors.


ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and approved the project with the following modifications:  1) remove the deck and; 2) remove the decorative railing.


AYES: Antonini, Bradford Bell, Boyd, Feldstein, Hughes, S. Lee, W. Lee

1380 HAMPSHIRE STREET
  - west side, between 25th and 26th Streets; Lot 011 in Assessor's Block 4275 -  Request for Discretionary Review and Planning Department Staff-Initiated Discretionary Review, of Building Permit Application No. 2003.07.07.8907 to construct a new one-story vertical addition and a rear horizontal addition to the existing two-story building in an RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District with a 40-X Height and Bulk Designation.


Preliminary Recommendation:  Take Discretionary Review and approve the project with modifications.


SPEAKER(S):


Re:  Continuance


Jose Obrego


- He would like a continuance mostly because he is not too familiar with the processes, technicalities, etc.


- This project was formally presented the first week of November of last year.


- The project does not take into affect the impact that he will be receiving with this project.


- He does not want to be put into the position to make decisions on such a high impact project.


Mathew Klyne


- It appears that the concern of the DR requestor is how this project will affect the foundation of the DR requestor's home.


Re:  Merits of Project


(-) Jose Obrego


- There were many questions that the DR requestor had regarding the affects of the project on her home and the financial impact.


- The DR requestor is a 75-year-old retiree.


- They support the findings and agree that this project will conserve and protect the neighborhood character.


- The Project Sponsor intends to create condominiums and this will affect the neighborhood.


- He displayed photographs of the driveway and all the issues related to it.


- He is concerned that the height of the project will completely block out light.


(-) Michael Hall


- He is the attorney for the Discretionary Review requestor.


- He was just hired last week and that is the reason to consider continuance.


- He feels that there has only been the Planner's recommendation for a few days.


- More time is needed to analyze the Planner's recommendation, the impact of shadow, the height, and other items that will negatively affect the Discretionary Review requestor's home.


- If the project is approved, it will only leave 18 feet of back yard area for a car port.


- The project is too large and too high.  It will diminish the benefit that the Discretionary Review requestor has since she has been living there for 40 years.


(-) Leo Mondragon


- He lives in the neighborhood.


- The project is very, very high and will take the light to his house and the DR requestor's home.


- Parking is very hard to find in the area and with this project it will be made worse.


(-) Andrew McAllister


- He has rented from the DR requestor for about eight years.


- Regarding the separation of the two buildings, he feels that this is the worst case of "carpet bagging" he has ever seen.


- The project sponsor is trying to separate the buildings and asking the DR requestor to pay.


- The wall where the separation of the buildings will be is in his son's room.


- The DR requestor is quite happy the way everything is.


- The Project Sponsor does not even live in the neighborhood.  


- Two cars for three condos?  This is not going to be the case.  There will be at least six cars.


(-) Erika Lopez


- She lives across the street from the proposed project.


- She knows that the owner of the building where she lives has submitted a letter against the project.


- This is a great neighborhood.


(+) Mathew Klein - Project Sponsor


- He displayed photographs of the street facade proving that it is actually a three story neighborhood, contrary to what the Planner has said.


- He spoke about the architectural aspects of the project.


- The Planner has requested to have a setback yet this would be inconsistent with the Residential Design guidelines.


ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and approved the project with the following modifications:  1) reduce height by 5 feet per the Planning Department's recommendation so that the overall height of the building shall not exceed 35 feet; 2) project sponsor shall provide a matching light well to the adjacent property for the 3
rd
 floor addition, 3) that it be demonstrated to staff that the parking will be accessible; 4) work be conducted within the project sponsor's property line; 5) all load bearing costs as a result of this addition be born by the project sponsor.


AYES: Antonini, Bradford Bell, Boyd, Feldstein, Hughes, S. Lee, W. Lee

Mathew Klein


Re:  Light wells


- Light wells are requested to be matched for neighbors in general.


- There is no information in the Residential Design Guidelines regarding maximum or minimum square footage required to match, or as to what would happen if both adjacent neighbors had light wells.


- At which point is one required to match each of those circumstances?


- The Commission will continue to hear cases like this.


- The Bernal Heights special restrictions in place and they are very specific about what one can do to ones building.


- He hopes that the Residential Design Guidelines can be looked at with the same critical eye to questions such as matching light wells.
