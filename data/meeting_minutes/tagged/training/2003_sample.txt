MARKET AND OCTAVIA NEIGHBORHOOD PLAN, PUBLIC REVIEW DRAFT - BRIEFING AND PUBLIC COMMENT

www.betterneighborhoods.org
.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of March 13, 2003)


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Ramona Davies - Northern California Presbyterian Homes and Services


- She supports the vision and the plan of the Rainbow Adult Housing Community since they are interested in parcels P and O as one entity rather than two parcels.


- However, they would like the plan modified to accommodate their vision for a center  that will provide senior housing and services for the LGBT community.


(+) Norman Rolfe - Member of the Central Freeway Advisory Committee


- The plan is generally quite good it will be in an urban neighborhood.


- Regarding the parking requirements: he does urge the Commission to do what is recommended -- make 1 for 1 the maximum and have no minimum.  If zero parking is wanted then that should be done.


(+) Howard Strassner - Sierra Club


- The club strongly supports this plan.


- This plan goes "back to the future," before people opened their stores even without parking.


- It is not necessary to provide parking.  Transit will not work if parking is constantly provided.


(+) Robert Meyers


- He reviewed the draft and wants to complement staff for producing such an excellent, readable document.


- This plan has superb goals.


- There are residents who are anxiously waiting that this plan to be approved.


- He only has one request:  slightly increase the height limits.


- He urges the continued support of staff.


(+) Ashley Hamlett - Hayes Valley Neighborhood Association


- This plan and process is quite fabulous.


- There has been a lot of community involvement, which has made people become more involved in community meetings.


(+) Ron Hartman


- He handed out a diagram explaining how the 50-foot height limit is a bit high for certain areas.


- He encouraged the height of 50 feet around Octavia but the remaining three faces (the uphill side of Fell, uphill side of Oak and all of Laguna) be at the 40-foot height limit.


- He looks forward to seeing this come together sooner than later.


(+) Mike Ellis


- He commended staff on this plan.


- He recommended a few changes to the plan regarding the 50-foot height restrictions on certain areas because it will be out-of-character with the other buildings on the street.


- He asked that there not be an extension of Hickory Alley.  A pedestrian green belt would make more sense.


(+) Christopher Pederson


- He is very enthusiastic about this plan.


- The central location of the neighborhood and the transit options make this area a great place to live.


- He supports the provisions of the plan to limit parking.


- Improving transit gives people an opportunity to visit the arts.


(+) Anthony Faber - MMPAL SOMA Leadership Council


- He is very much in support of this plan.  He really enjoyed the community plan meetings.


(+) Robin Levitt


- He has read the plan and is very supportive of the plan because it really and truly deals with the issues of the neighbors.


- This plan really reflects the outcome of the community meetings.


- The reduction of parking and density are very important aspects of the plan.


(+/-) Jim Haas - Chairman of Civic Pride


- The proposed plan is an excellent plan for an enhanced residential neighborhood.


- There are institutions that people attend.  They come from outside of the city and drive cars.


- He is concerned about the people who drive cars into the area.


- The plan needs to be amended to include these institutions.


(+/-) Jon Twichell


- The Civic Center area has many uses:  residential, State and Federal employees, and the regional center for performing arts.


- When a study like this is done, peak times should be taken into account.


- There are hundreds of people who are already on public transportation, yet during peak performing arts periods people drive to the Civic Center.


(+/-) John Keazer - Director of Electronic Media for the San Francisco Symphony


- He asks that the parking situation be looked at closely because the performing arts patrons and institutions would be affected.


- He is concerned about the reports related to parking and traffic.


(+) Ron Miguel


- He complemented staff on the manner in which this plan has been handled.  


- The community input has been incredible.


- This is a very unusual neighborhood. One that will ask for increased density and reduced parking.


- He realizes that the Civic Center would have an issue with parking.


(+) Kate White - Housing Action Coalition


- They are thrilled with this plan.


- She has never seen such enthusiasm for a plan that the Planning Department worked on.


- The Department is doing a great job on educating the neighborhood.


- The plan is very specific; the zoning is very clear, etc.


(+) Heather Thomson - Transportation for a Livable City


- Her organization supports this plan completely.


- This plan will increase housing density while improving traffic and transit issues.


- She urges the Commission to support this plan as well.


(-) Marcy Adelman - Rainbow Adult Community Housing


- Housing in support of the LGBT elder population is very important.


- The plan generally reflects the desires of the neighborhood.


- Her concerns are related to Parcels O and P.


- The plan, as now written, subdivides these parcels preventing the possibility of creating a mixed-used, community-serving hub as they envision.


(-) Clark Seally - Rainbow Adult Community Housing


- The plan is confusing about the division of Parcels O and P.


- Subdividing these parcels will prevent the opportunity of creating a community-serving organization.


(-) Judy Macks - Rainbow Adult Community Housing


- There are plans for an expansion of their housing organization.


- She would like the Market Street/Octavia Street plan be revised to allow flexibility for expanding organizations.


(-) Matile Ruthschild - Rainbow Adult Community Housing


- She is a senior who is a lesbian and would like to live in a place where she will be able to feel comfortable with other seniors who share her same ideas.


- She asked the Commission to support senior housing in the Market Street area.


- The plans for parcels O and P would make it difficult for the ROCK organization to expand.


(-) Nolan Madson - Hay Valley Resident


- Although there are a number of details to be addressed, this is an excellent plan.


- He supports the ROCK project and recommends that parcels O and P not be combined.


- He fears the boring loft condos developers will build in the area if lots are divided.


(-) Jan Faulkner - Rainbow Adult Community Housing


- She supports what the pervious speakers have said.


- She recently moved to San Francisco after living in Berkley.  She moved to San Francisco to live closer to her community, yet she would have loved to move into her community.


(+) Patricia Walkup - Friends of Octavia Boulevard


- There are very few green spaces where people can congregate.


- Streets and sidewalks should be able to be used for people to congregate.


- The parking requirement should be reduced for new developments.


- Storefronts are needed and not just blank garages as some of the more recent developments have.


- Transit first is very important for Van Ness and Mission Streets.


- She asked the Commission to support these elements because without them the plan does not work.


(+) Nancy Brundy - Institute on Aging


- They are here in support of the ROCK group--to not divide lots P and O.


- There are special needs for the LGBT community.


- She hopes that the Commission will allow the flexibility to maximize the potential for this site.


(+) Stefan Hastrup - HVNA


- He has attended almost all of the Better Neighborhoods workshops.


- This plan is what the neighborhood has been waiting for many years.


- He hopes that this plan is developed in the quickest way possible.


- Housing is more important than garages.


- He commends the Planning Department for listening to their needs.


(-) Ingrid Summerfield


- This plan is excellent and she hopes that the pan goes forward.


- She is concerned with the height limit in the Laguna/Oak/Fell area.


- Hopefully the developer will come up with a creative way to build there.


- She is in favor with the ROCK project and hopes that their height can be limited.


(+) Gary Gee - Gary Gee Architects


- He complimented staff on a great document.


- He submitted a document with all his concerns.


(+/-) Calvin Welch - Council for Community Housing Organizations


- His organization pushed the Mayor to fund this kind of planning.


- They were the ones doing affordable housing in neighborhoods before the Planning Department did this.


- They are very happy with this and happy to move forward with it.  They are delighted that many people support affordable housing, but he is stunned with the language in the plan.


- All of the policies on affordable housing talk about home ownership in this document.


- This document is not properly written.  This is not the policy of this Commission on this policy.


(+) George Orleas


- He thanked the Commission for their time during these hearings.  He also thanked the community for coming out and making this plan work.


-  Because there are a lot of seniors who are living on the street he supports senior affordable housing in this area.


(-) Sean Kiegran


- Housing is sacrificed to satisfy this 1 to 1 ration for parking.


- He encourages a plan that allows less than 1 to 1 parking.

Written comments will be received at the Planning Department until 5 pm, April 3, 2003. 


Preliminary Recommendation: Public Hearing to receive comments.  No action required.


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Norman Rolfe


- Proposition H would extend the Transbay Terminal.  This project would conflict with this expansion of the terminal.


- There is the issue of the housing demand, which is highly questionable.


- This is really a faulty environmental report.  It is based on assumptions that are not correct.


(-) Ian Lewis - H.E.R.E. - Local 2


- The union will be submitting comments regarding the EIR.


- This EIR does not adequately address the review of any project that includes a hotel dimension.


- Whatever extensions the jobs create, the burden on social services would fall on the City.  He is concerned with the jobs created by this project.


- There are a number of concerns beyond section 303 (of the code).  In particular, this project needs to be considered closely in context of the Transbay Terminal development and the Cal Train station.


- With good coordination, there would be less problems with the projects proposed in the area.


(-) John Carney


- He was shocked to see this project on the agenda because it requires seven variances.


- He believes that the environmental review should be done on a project that has no basic variances from seven different codes.


- This project is out of scale for the neighborhood even if the code allows it.


(-) Sue Hestor


- Part of this project should include the removal of the pedestrian bridge.


- This project is going to put a lot of pedestrians in the area.


- This project will be just too tall.


ACTION: Public hearing held.  No action required.

710 EDINBURGH STREET
 - west side between Italy and France Avenues.  Assessor's Block 6342 Lot 004 -  Request for Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application No. 2002 0828 5143, to construct a two-story, horizontal addition, to the front of the rear building (dwelling) on the property and to construct a second story, vertical addition, to the front building (garage) in an RH-1 (Residential House, 1 Family) District, and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.    


Preliminary Recommendation:  Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project.


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Leticia Redondo


- She is concerned about her kitchen window because the proposed property will block her main source of daylight.  This would cause her to use electric light all day.


- Garages are intended to house cars, not people.  It would just take a simple stove, microwave or hot place to make the downstairs unit into an apartment.


(-) Mike Hutchinson


- His concern is more about the entire structure because it will block out light to his whole house--not just his kitchen.


- The project sponsor has been doing construction to his house without obtaining permits.  After the neighbors complained, the project sponsor quickly obtained permits.


- He does not understand why the project sponsor cannot build toward the back of his house instead of above.


(+) Corazon Metraparel


- She asked the Commission to approve her project because she has met all the requirements.


- There is a light well so the window will not be blocked.


- She spoke to the DR requestor, Ms. Rodondo, and suggested she could build a roof for her.


- She has already had a Notice of Special Restriction issued on her property.


(+) Sean Kriegan


- If you begin a practice of protecting existing property line windows, the amount of housing that can be produced will be limited.


- The Project Sponsor has already designed a cut out and he believes that should be enough for the DR requestor.


ACTION: Did not take Discretionary Review and approved the building application with the requirement to record a Notice of Special Restriction limiting the use of the subject property to single-family residential use.


AYES: Antonini, Bradford Bell, Feldstein, S. Lee, W. Lee


ABSENT: Boyd and Hughes

891 CAROLINA STREET
 - east side, between 20th Street and 22nd Street; Lot 027 in Assessor's Block 4097 -  Request for Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application No. 2002.05.08.6090 proposing to construct a new two-story vertical and horizontal addition to the existing single-story over garage building with an attic level.  The project proposes an increase from one to two dwelling units.  The project is in an RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District with a 40-X Height and Bulk Designation.  The proposal also requires a front setback Variance for the second story, which will be considered by the Zoning Administrator.


Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and approve the project with modifications.


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Kris Gardner - Discretionary Review Requestor


- She is encouraged that the project sponsor wants to expand his building.


- The design of the proposed structure is not compatible with the other homes on the street.


- The propped design is a 235% increase to the original property but is considered only an alternation.


- She is in agreement with the Planning Department to reduce the height by eliminating the top story.  This would be in keeping with the block face. 


(-) John Carney


- He agrees with the Planning Department's recommendation to reduce the top floor.


(-) Dick Millet


- He was happy to hear what the Planning Department had to say.


- The scale is so much better after taking the recommendations of the Department.


(-) Peter Rudolfi


- Builders should not be allowed to build to the full extent of the building envelope.


- The design of the building is not in character with the other buildings on Potrero Hill.


- The Planning Department should be complemented on their study and recommendation of this project.


(-) Julie Jackson


- This project is significantly out of scale with the buildings on the block.


- She supports the recommendation from the Planning Department to reduce the height and mass of the building.


(-) Foster Reed


- This is the third project to come up on the block.


- These projects should not even come to this stage.


- The neighborhoods will be destroyed if this is allowed as presented.


(-) Chris Cole


- He displayed a large model showing other ways to build the project by not impacting the DR requestor.


(-) Ches Herbert


- He gets a lot of sunlight into his home and his yard.  The proposed project would block this sunlight.


- The proposed alternation in the back is no less disruptive.


- He also recommended reducing the pitched roof, therefore reducing the height even more.


(-) Bobbi Frioli


- She is concerned with privacy issues.  Staff has done a great job to revise the project to deal with the neighbor's issues.  However, she is still concerned with all the windows on the side of her house.


(-) Lewis Goldhammer


- The issues he has are related to the audacity of this proposal--the project sponsor has taken advantage of the rear neighbor.


- The project sponsor is trying to push the envelope and go as far as he can.


(-) Richard Katz


- There have been a lot of changes in the San Francisco area.


- His major concerns are that this project would change the character of the neighborhood, and it doesn't respect the blockface of the street.


- This is a bad project for the neighborhood.


- His wife suffers from SAD and it is important to receive all the sunlight as possible.


(+) William Walters - Project Architect


- He commended staff for a great job on this project.


- He has had an architectural practice in Potrero Hill for about 15 years.


- The current house has been deteriorating for a long time.


- About five years ago the project sponsor came to him with an idea to demolish the house and rebuild it.


- The proposed design is similar to structures on the opposite side of the street.


(+) Pete Loskotoff


- He was born and raised in the Potrero Hill area.


- This project is not going to hurt anybody.  The views are not blocked.  The City would be benefited if this project is approved.


(+) Bill Canihan


- His family was born and raised in San Francisco.


- There is a firehouse behind the subject property.


- He feels challenged that the neighbors say that this project is out of scale with the neighborhood.


- The upper level is important to him.  He is willing to change the windows on the south side, willing to change materials, etc.  He has been working for several years to try to meet the concerns of the neighbors.


ACTION: Following public testimony, the Commission closed the public hearing and continued this item to April 3, 2003.  Both Discretionary Review requestor and Project Sponsor were asked to explore possible alternatives to the plans.


AYES: Antonini, Bradford Bell, S. Lee, W. Lee
