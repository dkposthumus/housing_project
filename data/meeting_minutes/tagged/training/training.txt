This is a business decision that Metro PCS will make.\n- Sutro Tower is a consolidated communications tower that was designed to serve the entire City.\n- Sutro Tower is one of the most secure infrastructure facilities in the City of San Francisco.\n- There have been some suggestions that it is necessary to put an antenna on this tower.\n- This is a standard cellular antenna.  It has no structural, visual or health impacts.\n(-) Sean Elsbernd – Legislative Aid to Supervisor Tony Hall\n- Supervisor Hall shares the concerns of the neighbors in the immediate vicinity of Sutro Tower.\n- The neighborhoods near Sutro Tower are very unique neighborhoods.  These neighborhoods have to deal with a large amount of antennas.  Yet, how much is too much?  At what point do we reach the saturation point?\n(-) Shaw-Lin Chen – Homeowner and Midtown Terrace Homeowners Association\n- She is speaking on behalf of the 842 homeowners in the Midtown Terrace Homeowners Association.\n- Approval of this permit would bring over 240 antennas to over 5 antenna sites.\n- This residential neighborhood is already saturated with antennas.\n- On October 1, the neighborhood requested a meeting with the project sponsor and with Sutro Tower.  The meeting occurred on October 10.  The neighborhood learned that this site is not technologically necessary for Metro to deliver services to its customers.  The neighbors also learned Metro customers would be better served by a system that is relatively low to the ground, more typical of the wireless industry.\n- The fact that the other wireless carriers can deliver service to its customers without antennas on Sutro Tower suggests that this is technologically feasible for Metro as well.\n- The neighborhood residents should not have to bear the consequences of Metro's poor planning.\n- There are other safety issues regarding this proposal as well.\n(-) Doris S. Linnenbach – \n- Since 1966, she has been attending meetings regarding Sutro Tower.\n- This tower was a television tower and an FM tower.  She was never told that this tower would have so much cellular antennas.\n- She would like to have the Commission take Discretionary Review and be allowed to have some meaningful dialogue with Sutro Tower.\n(-) Tracey Hughes - SNAFU\n- She hopes that the Commission listens to the people here who are against this project.\n- All antennas need to follow the WTS Guidelines and this does not. Maybe it's tricky and it can be exempt but she is not sure.\n- There are different frequencies that antennas use and it could cause problems with frequencies for 911.\n- Members of the community do not have \u001c big hot shot\u001d  lawyers to do their research for them.\n- It's time that these antennas are stopped.\nACTION:          Did not take Discretionary Review and approved the building permit with the standard conditions for facilities on Sutro Tower.  \nAYES:          Baltimore, Chinchilla, Fay, Joe, Salinas, Theoharis\nNAYES:          Lim\n\n", "completion": "{\"case_number\": \"2001.0910D\", \"project_address\": \"1 palo alto drive\", \"lot_number\": \"003\", \"assessor_block\": \"2724\", \"project_descr\": \"staff initiated discretionary review of building permit application no. 2001/07/31/4957 for installation of three flush mount panel antennas and one GPS antenna on the third level of sutro tower, and installation of related equipment cabinets encloesd in the third level of the tower.\", \"type_district\": \"rh-1\", \"type_district_descr\": \"residential house, one-family\", \"height_and_bulk_district\": \"40-x\", \"preliminary_recommendation\": \"approval with conditions\", \"speaker_statements\": [{\"speaker\": \"debra stein\", \"lines\": [\"representing metro pcs\", \"thanks the planner for doing a great job on the project\", \"clarifies it is not certain the antennas will be removed; this is a metro pcs business decision\", \"sutro tower is a consolidated communications tower designed to serve the entire city\", \"sutro tower is one of the most secure infrastructure facilities in san francisco\", \"there have been suggestions that an antenna on this tower is necessary\", \"this is a standard cellular antenna with no structural, visual, or health impacts\"]}, {\"speaker\": \"sean elsbernd\", \"lines\": [\"legislative aid to supervisor tony hall\", \"supervisor hall shares neighbors’ concerns near sutro tower\", \"nearby neighborhoods already host many antennas; asks how much is too much and when saturation is reached\"]}, {\"speaker\": \"shaw-lin chen\", \"lines\": [\"homeowner; midtown terrace homeowners association\", \"speaking on behalf of 842 homeowners\", \"approval would bring the total to over 240 antennas across more than 5 sites\", \"the residential neighborhood is already saturated with antennas\", \"on october 1 the neighborhood requested a meeting; on october 10 met with the sponsor and sutro tower\", \"learned the site is not technologically necessary for metro to deliver service\", \"argues customers would be better served by a lower-to-the-ground system typical in the industry\", \"other carriers serve customers without antennas on sutro tower, suggesting this is feasible for metro\", \"residents should not bear the consequences of metro’s poor planning\", \"notes additional safety concerns with the proposal\"]}, {\"speaker\": \"doris s. linnenbach\", \"lines\": [\"has attended sutro tower meetings since 1966\", \"sutro was originally a television and fm tower; was never told it would host so many cellular antennas\", \"requests the commission take discretionary review and allow meaningful dialogue with sutro tower\"]}, {\"speaker\": \"tracey hughes\", \"lines\": [\"san francisco neighborhood antenna-free union (snafu)\", \"urges the commission to listen to opponents of the project\", \"states all antennas must follow wts guidelines and believes this one does not; maybe it is exempt but she is unsure\", \"different antenna frequencies could interfere with 911\", \"community members do not have big hotshot lawyers to do research for them\", \"it is time to stop these antennas\"]}], \"action\": \"did not take discretionary review and approved the building permit with the standard conditions for facilities on sutro tower\", \"ayes\": \"baltimore, chinchilla, fay, joe, salinas, theoharis\", \"noes\": \"lim\", \"speakers\": \"\", \"modifications\": \"\", \"absent\": [], \"vote\": \"\", \"action_name\": \"\"} <extra_id_0>"}

The net change in area for the site would be an increase of about 982,850 gsf.  The proposed development would contain about 130,560 gsf of office space; a 120-suite extended-stay hotel (about 164,800 gsf); 320 residential units (about 551,000 gsf); ground-floor retail and restaurant space (about 9,400 gsf); a publicly accessible atrium (about 6,400 gsf); and lobbies (about 4,340 gsf).  Building services would occupy about 33,400 gsf and mechanical space would occupy about 104,840 gsf.  There would be three off-street loading docks and four off-street van spaces, and 400 spaces of underground parking and vehicular circulation on four levels (about 151,760 gsf).
