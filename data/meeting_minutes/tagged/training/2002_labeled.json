        "project_descr": "THE NEW De YOUNG MUSEUM PROJECT - Findings Of Consistency With General Plan And Planning Code Priority Policies For The New De Young Museum Project In Golden Gate Park. The proposed project would demolish and reconstruct the M.H. De Young Museum on the site of the existing De Young Museum in Golden Gate Park. The project would include demolition of eight existing buildings, totaling approximately 230,000 square feet, which compose the De Young Museum and the Asian Art Museum. (The Asian Art Museum will move to the Civic Center.) The new building would include two main levels above grade, one level below grade, with a varying roof height ranging from 33 to 48 feet, and a 144-foot tower at the northeast corner of the project site. The building would increase current De Young Museum gallery and exhibition space at the site from the existing 37,000 sf to total about 75,000 sf. The project would remove the 85 existing paved parking spaces for museum staff, currently on the eastern side of the museum, and would not provide replacement parking. The project site is within the P (Public Use) zoning district and within an OS (Open Space) Height and Bulk District, Assessor’s Block 1700, Lot 1, bounded to the north and east by John F. Kennedy Drive, to the south by Tea Garden Drive and to the west by the Hagiwara Japanese Tea Garden. Planning Code Sections 234.1 and 290 require uses in a P district and an OS height and bulk district be in conformity with the General Plan.",
