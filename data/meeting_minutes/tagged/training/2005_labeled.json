        "project_descr": "Appeal of Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration - The proposed project would consist of construction of a residential and commercial mixed-use development after demolition of a defunct bottling plant facility at 5800 Third Street (Assessor’s Block 5431A, Lot 001), at the southwest corner of Third Street and Carroll Avenue in the Bayview neighborhood. The project would include 355 multi-family residential units in four buildings, 13,000 gross square feet (gsf) of ground floor retail space in two of the buildings that would be along Third Street, and 379 off-street parking spaces in the four buildings. The four buildings would total 641,920 gsf in size, ranging in height from 50 to 60 feet tall (four to five stories) and would be built around a central plaza and a private driveway with two visitor loading spaces, with access from Carroll Avenue. Sixteen surface parking spaces for the retail uses would be provided on the south side of the project site, with access provided from a right-turn-only driveway on Third Street at the southern boundary of the site. Twenty surface parking spaces for visitors would be provided along the central private driveway. Currently, the 5.75-acre site is occupied by a three-story, 103,000-gsf closed Coca-Cola bottling plant constructed in 1966, which would be demolished. Current use of the site is temporary parking of moving company trucks and charter buses. The site is the proposed Bayview Hunters Point Redevelopment Projects and Zoning Health Center Activity Node. The project would require Conditional Use Authorization for a Planned Unit Development and for residential uses in an M-1 District by the Planning Commission, which is a public hearing process.",
