COMMISSIONERSâ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
 


 


4.         Commission Comments/Questions


        
Inquiries/Announcements
.  Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).


        
Future Meetings/Agendas
.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.


 


Commissioner Miguel
:


Iâd like to welcome Commissioner Borden back to the dais.  We missed you.  I hope you have as enjoyable another four years as the past two years have been and it will be our pleasure to work with you for that time.  Thank you for coming back.


I had the pleasure of doing a tour last Friday of the about to be open Laguna Honda new facility.  If anyone has the opportunity to visit â to do a tour takes about two hours.  Itâs a massive facility.  It is to me quite unbelievable, having known the old facility, some of which will still be in the process of renovation.  The staff moves in I think this week or next.  The residents will move in November 7
th
 and 8
th
.  The way itâs laid out, their programs, their process, the art work that is in there, which is quite unbelievable, all make for a very interesting facility â from the actual site layout to the manner in which elder care has progressed over the years; and their ability to create this facility so that it will still be viable in the next 50 or so years.  So if you get a chance, please go out and see it.


Commissioner Antonini:


This last week Iâve had a few meetings.  One of which was with the Project Sponsor for 120 Cherry, which is no longer before us; also the SFPUC â that was a very productive meeting; thirdly with management of Daniel Bernum Court with concerns regarding construction impacts with Cal Pacific.  I very much encourage the public, particularly those with concerns about projects, to call me at any time.  Itâs better to be able to discuss things ahead of time and see what the concerns are and perhaps have a dialog than to only hear about it the day of the hearing. 


Commissioner Borden
:


I am glad to be back.  I want to thank the Mayor and the Board of Supervisors for supporting my re-appointment for another four-year term; and thank my colleagues President Miguel and Vice President Olague for being there and testifying in my support; and also thank all those others who were kind enough to come out to the hearing and testify.


Commissioner Moore
:


Based on Commissioner Bordenâs recommendation, I got a call from Booker Washington.  They were specific requests for me to comment on architecture.  I suggested as a more constructive way from my perspective, that two or three commissioners participate with staff, and if the Director has time, with the Director, to really discuss it soon in a group rather than individually.  I donât think any of us are skilled enough to really do [   ] design of a project.  But the comments, which come from this commission, heard with each other in a fruitful discussion, for me, are much more productive and I think support the goals of the Department much better.  I suggested to them to contact staff and from there we would organize a meeting and whoever wants to participate, I volunteered, can do so.   


Commissioner Sugaya
:


Commissioner Moore and I participated in a meeting with Supervisor Campos with regard to his proposed Health Care Services Master Plan legislation, which I believe will be coming to the Commission in the next month or so.  It was very productive and we were able to give him some feedback on that.


Commissioner Moore:


I was extremely pleased to listen to land use under the discussion of the Americaâs Cup.  It was the first time that many city agencies and departments are coming together.  I look for our own â talking to this group of commissioners here â participation in a fruitful dialog.  It sounds very exciting and if properly balanced and done, I think it could be a very exciting venture.  I congratulate everybody who has the opportunity to participate in it.


Commissioner Olague
:


I also for disclosure purposed met with the staff of Supervisor Campos to discuss citywide health legislation.  It seems pretty interesting.  I look forward to hearing more about it.


Commissioner Borden:


I also met with Supervisor Campos on this legislation and made some suggestions.


 


 


D.         DIRECTORâS REPORT


 


5.         Directorâs Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


Good afternoon.  That Health Care legislation that you mentioned is scheduled to come to you I think toward the end of the month.  Staff is working on our analysis of that and weâll come to you with recommendations I think on the 28
th. 
 


The only other thing I wanted to bring to your attention is a memo in your packets regarding 1321 De Haro Street.  Many of us, and I know many of you have been receiving emails on this.  Just to remind you, you approved this project, or did not take discretionary review on this project but also asked that they not provide a garage in the back of the building.  The project sponsor has complied with that, but there is much concern in the neighborhood that they are proposing to have a driveway access through the open space and have asked you for a hearing.  I understand the concerns of the neighborhood on this issue but this is a totally private matter between two property owners.  The Commission, nor the staff, or any other department has any jurisdiction on this matter.  There really is nothing we can do about that situation.  The project sponsor has done what youâve asked him to do and is asking the Zoning Administrator for a variance on the parking requirement, but the access to the open space is a private matter between the project sponsor and the owners of that space, and therefore there is no jurisdiction that this Commission has over that issue.  So our recommendation is that you not have a hearing on this item because a hearing would be for no real purpose at this point.  I just wanted to put that on the record and the memo dated September 30 in your packets explains that as well.


      


6.         Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.


 


BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:


 


Land Use Committee:  


        
The Committee heard a 
rezoning request related to
 
1717 17
th
 Street
.  This item was before the Commission on September 16
th
 at which time you recommended approval.  This ordinance would correct a zoning map error that occurred during the Eastern Neighborhood rezoning.  It would realign the zoning controls with the height controls that in all instances UMU zoned districts would have a 17 foot ground floor and PDR districts would have 15 foot ground floor.  
This week the Land Use Committee recommended approval.


        
The Committee heard another item titled âArea Plan Impact Feesâ that would make technical corrections to certain fees to increase consistency in application of these fees citywide.  
You heard this item on July 1.  At that hearing you agreed with the corrections recommended by staff and you also added an exemption for one property (SF Jazz) so that it would not have to pay impact fees for the educational/institutional use associated with the property.
  This
 
week at the Land use Committee, Supervisor Maxwell stated that if all other educational/institutional uses are required to pay fees for their impacts, this project should be subject to the same fees.  Planning Department staff and SF Jazz explained the rationale behind the Commissionâs action.  The Committee was not moved and modified the ordinance such that SF Jazz would pay the impact fees.  With this modification, the item was continued and is scheduled for hearing at next weekâs Land Use hearing
.


        
An ordinance regarding in part to TDR in general and in part to a specific parcel at 680 California Street â Old St. Maryâs Church. â 
Among other changes this ordinance would add a clause requiring a property owner who sells theTDR to use the money to cure any outstanding city violations; severe maintenance issues; and provide the Zoning Administrator with a maintenance plan for the upkeep of the building.  The HPC considered the ordinance on June 2
nd
 and recommended approval.  This commission considered the ordinance on June 20
th
 and recommended approval.  As we discussed last week, the legislation was split into two pieces allowing the Land Use Committee to pass out the original legislation as you heard it â this version passed with the Boardâs vote of (+10 -0) last week to approve the rezoning.
  This Monday, the Land Use Committee heard a revised version of the ordinance that adds more specificity on restrictions to the TDR funds in response to concerns raised by SPUR and others.  The primary change was to tie the requirements to an earlier point (statement of eligibility) instead of at the sale of TDRs.  This change, in effect, grandfathers in existing properties that have already received statement of eligibility bout would apply going forward.  All public testimony was in support of this revised version.  It is currently scheduled to be considered by the Full Board next week and would supersede the earlier version of the ordinance.


        
The Committee continued the update to the Planning Code and the Administrative Code so that MOH and Planning staff can ensure that the legislation is user-friendly and uses consistent terminology. 


Full Board of Supervisors:


        
Ordinance that would create an SUD for the LGBT Center at 1800 Market Street
 â This ordinancw was considered by this commission on July 22 and by the HPC on July 21.  Both Commissions recommended approval with a non-substantive modification.  
This Tuesday, the Board passed the legislation with your recommended modification
. 


        
As is evident, this Tuesday the Full Board reappointed Gwyneth Borden to the Planning Commission
.


There were three planning related appeals before the Board this week:


1.
     
222 2
nd
 Street â EIR appeal:  
This CEQA appeal was related to a project that would create over 430,000 square feet of office use with approximately 54 parking spaces in a district zoned for downtown office uses.  At the hearing, some of the Board members were concerned about the EIRâs shadow analysis at non-Prop K locations.  The project as proposed would require rezoning for height on a portion of the site.  This Commission recommended approval of the rezoning in conjunction with the project approvals.  The rezoning ordinance necessary for this project is pending before the Land Use Committee and will be heard at a later date.  
At the Tuesday appeal, the Board upheld the EIR 7 to 4.


2.
    
1268 Grant Avenue CU appeal â
 The Commissin granted the CU on August 5.  The CU was for âother entertainmentâ to install a karaoke machine on the first floor.  Since the appeal was filed, new information was presented to the Department about former restrictions placed on the property by the Board of Appeals in 2005 in a Notice of Special Restrictions.  Department staff did a site visit last week and found that the King of Thai Noodle has illegally expanded the bar use on the 2
nd
 floor without a permit.  As such the Department recommended that the Board uphold the appeal and overturn the CU so that the owner can address the outstanding violations.  
The
 
Board voted 11 to 0 to uphold the appeal and overturn the CU.


3.
    
795 Forester â parcel subdivision appeal
 â The project was heard by the Planning Commission on a DR on August 5
th
.  The Commission did not take DR and upheld a project that would 1) divide a lot into 4 parcels; 2) construct 3 single-family new homes on 3 parcels and have an existing house on the 4
th
 lot.  The appellant did not think the parcel division should occur because it did not meet the General Plan and the new lots were inconsistent with the neighborhood.  Planning demonstrated that the lots were 25 feet wide and consistent with the neighborhood and explained General Plan policies in support of the subdivision.  
The Board voted to uphold the project and to vote against the appellant 10 to 0 (Elsbernd was recused).


Introductions:


        
None


 


BOARD OF APPEALS


        
1381 De Haro Street â 
Appeal of a variance decision (case No. 2008.0505V) dated July 20, 2010, that granted a rear yard variance.  The Commission heard the underlying building permit as a DR on October 15, 2009, took DR and approved the project without parking at the rear (accessed from the Starr-King Open Space).  The two appellants, Starr-King Open Space and Potrero Boosters, argued that the rear yard encroachment would negatively impact the Starr-King Open Space and cited a previous variance decision from 1993 that denied a vertical addition to the existing building.  The variance was granted based on plans that had parking at the front of the property, while the plans submitted to the Board did not have any parking.  
Therefore, the Board continued the item to November 3
rd
 because the project sponsor had not submitted the correct plans for the project
.


        
281 Turk Street â 
Appeal of over-the-counter building permit for retail use (pharmacy) at the subject property.  Permit appealed by neighbors concerned about the proliferation of illegal prescription drug sales.  The Board voted 3-1-1 to deny the permit because of potential negative impacts on the neighborhood.  Four votes are needed to overturn the approval of the permit.  The Board continued the item to next week to allow Commissioner Hwang to vote.


 


HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION


        
The Commission approved two nominations to the National Register of Historic Places
 â 150 Otis Street 
(the San Francisco Juvenile Court and Detention Home) and
 116 New Montgomery Street 
(the Rialto Building
)


        
The Commission
 approved identification and delegation of Minor Permits to Alter for Significant and Contributory buildings and all buildings with Conservation Districts that are regulated under Article 11 of the Planning Code to the Planning Department with the modification that the projects be listed on the calendars of the HPC, 
which would allow the HPC and public to know what had been approved by staff and the ability to comment on them.


        
The Commission had a public hearing on the 
Draft EIR for the North Beach Library and Joe DiMaggio playground Master Plan â 701 Mason Street.
  They expressed a number of concerns and designated one of their members to come before you today to express those concerns.

LOWER CRYSTAL SPRINGS DAM IMPROVEMENTS PROJECT
 - 
Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report
. The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) proposes to implement the Lower Crystal Springs Dam Improvements (LCSDI) project to lift the operating restrictions on Crystal Springs Reservoir imposed by the California Department of Water Resources, Division of Safety of Dams (DSOD), and to restore the reservoirâs historical storage capacity. Proposed improvements to the dam and spillway would enable floodwater associated with the Probable Maximum Flood and other very large and infrequent floods to pass safely over the Lower Crystal Springs Dam. In addition, following completion of the proposed improvements, the SFPUC proposes to modify operations of Crystal Springs Reservoir such that the maximum normal water surface elevation would be restored to historic levels. All project components are located in an unincorporated area of San Mateo County on lands owned by the City and County of San Francisco.  


Please note: The public hearing on the Draft EIR is closed. The public comment period for the Draft EIR ended on April 16

Public Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Report
 â 701 Mason Street, southeast corner of Lombard Street and Columbus Avenue (Assessorâs Block 74, Lot 1); a portion of the Mason Street roadway between Lombard Street and Columbus Avenue; and 2000 Mason / 
661 Lombard Street, the entire block bounded by Lombard, Powell, and Greenwich Streets and Columbus Avenue (Assessorâs Block 75, Lot 1). The project sponsors, the San Francisco Public Library and Recreation and Park Department, propose to demolish the existing North Beach Branch Library and construct a new library and upgrade recreational facilities at the Joe DiMaggio Playground. The project would involve vacation (closure) of a 195-linear-foot portion of Mason Street to vehicular traffic, landscaping improvements in the Mason Street right-of-way, construction of a new 8,500-square-foot (sf) branch library on the 701 Lombard Street parcel and a portion of the right-of-way, demolition of the existing library and excavation, renovation and reorganization of the playground features. The project would result in a total net increase of approximately 3,200 sf of library floor area and about 12,010 sf of new open space. The project would require rezoning of Block 74, Lot 001 to a Public (P) use designation or Conditional Use authorization for a library in the North Beach Neighborhood Commercial zoning district; General Plan and Priority Policy conformity findings; as well as approval by the Library and Recreation and Park Commissions, Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors.
