		SAN FRANCISCO MUNICIPAL RAILWAY THIRD STREET LIGHT RAIL --
CERTIFICATION OF FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT (FEIR)
.  The San
Francisco Public Transportation Commission/Municipal Railway (Muni), in cooperation with
the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), proposes to construct a new light rail transit (LRT)
line into the southeastern quadrant of the City.  The FEIR analyzes the potential
environmental impacts (physical changes to the environment) of three alternative projects:
the No Project alternative, the No Build/Transportation System Management (TSM)
alternative and the Light Rail alternative.  The  Light Rail alternative has been selected as
the locally preferred alternative, and would extend Muni light rail service in two phases.  The
Initial Operating Segment (IOS) would extend light rail from King Street to the Bayshore
Caltrain Station via Third, Fourth and Bayshore Boulevard.  A later Central Subway phase
would extend service northward to Chinatown via Third/Fourth, Geary and Stockton.  In
addition, a new light rail maintenance and storage facility would be constructed on the
Western Pacific site.

An

within an 85-foot tall, eight-story (plus two mezzanine levels), approximately 390,300 gross
square-foot building on an approximate 55,770 square-foot site.  A paved parking lot
currently occupies the project site.  The project would require Conditional Use Authorization
by the Planning Commission for the proposed height, building bulk, and parking greater
than the accessory use amount.  (Since the PND was published, the project sponsor has
revised the project to consist of 200 dwelling units instead of 68 live/work units and 142
dwelling units.  Hence, a Variance from the rear yard requirement would need to be granted
by the Zoning Administrator.)

SPECIAL CALENDAR




 
1.	94.061E	(GITELMAN)


		DISPOSAL AND REUSE OF THE FORMER NAVAL SHIPYARD AT HUNTERS POINT
 
Public Hearing on the 
Revised
 Draft Environmental Impact Statement/ Environmental
Impact Report.  The City, Agency, and Navy have jointly prepared a 
Revised
 Draft EIS/EIR
regarding disposal and reuse of federal surplus land at the former Hunters Point Naval
Shipyard in San Francisco, California.  Revisions include substantial additions to the Draft
EIS/EIR published in November 1997 regarding the same project.  The 
Revised
 Draft
EIS/EIR considers the direct and indirect impacts of Navy disposal, and also analyzes a No
Action Alternative, and two reuse alternatives.  The Proposed Reuse Plan would be
implemented via the Hunters Point Shipyard Redevelopment Plan, adopted July 14, 1997,
and emphasizes mixed use of the site, including residential, industrial, maritime industrial,
cultural, institutional, mixed use, research and development, and open space uses.  Actions
which will rely on the completed EIS/EIR may include possible amendment of the
Redevelopment Plan, adoption of San Francisco General Plan amendments, conveyance
of the property from the Navy to the City/Agency, and subsequent local actions related to
reuse and redevelopment.
 


		NOTE:  WRITTEN COMMENTS WILL BE RECEIVED AT THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT
UNTIL 5:00 P.M., ON JANUARY 5, 1999.

10.	97.345E								                 (WONG)


		PUBLIC HEARING ON THE DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT
, Geneva Office
Building and Power House Demolition.
 
At 2301 San Jose Avenue, southeast corner of San
Jose and Geneva Avenues; within the western portion of Lot 36 in Assessor's Block 6972;
within a P (Public Use) Zoning District and the 40-X and 105-E Height and Bulk Districts. 
The project is the proposed demolition of two vacant buildings, commonly known as the
Geneva Office Building (City Landmark No. 180) and Power House.  Both buildings
proposed for demolition are eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. 
Unless demolished, both buildings would need seismic, structural and cosmetic repair.  The
buildings occupy the western portion of a site used as MUNI's maintenance and storage
facility for light rail vehicles (LRVs).  In place of the demolished buildings, MUNI proposes
to install about five employee parking spaces and additional rail tracks for storage of up to
seven LRVs.  The project would require a Certificate of Appropriateness by the Planning
Commission.  In addition, MUNI proposes to relocate a passenger boarding platform (key
stop) from its current location on San Jose Avenue at Seneca Avenue (one block north of
the project site), to San Jose Avenue adjacent to the project site.  Modifications to San Jose
Avenue in the proposed key stop vicinity following demolition of the buildings would include
minor street widening and restriping, and realignment of the pedestrian curb adjacent to the
project site.
