TREASURE ISLAND REUSE PLANNING STUDY
--Informational presentation on the
    "direction we are going" in selecting future development scenarios for Treasure
    Island and Yerba Buena Island. Informational presentation on the planning process for the
    civilian reuse of Treasure Island and Yerba Buena Island. In July 1996 the Planning
    Commission and Board of Supervisors adopted a Draft Reuse Plan for the Islands. The Draft
    Reuse Plan describes (1) land use, density and design parameters for future use of the
    Islands; (2) local initiatives for provision of housing and job training services to the
    City's homeless population; and (3) the costs of required capital improvements for the
    Islands' reuse, including shoreline stabilization, ferry improvements, utilities, and
    public services. In 1997 the State Legislature passed Senate Bill 699, the Treasure Island
    Conversion Act, which authorized the creation of a Treasure Island Development Authority
    (TIDA) to act as a redevelopment vehicle for the Islands. The Planning Department's
    current planning process seeks to transform the broad policies of the Reuse Plan into
    specific details for the development of the Islands using the financial and administrative
    tools of the TIDA. The Planning Department will prepare a draft Area Plan, underlying
    zoning controls, a Redevelopment Plan, and a Design for Development document which will be
    proposed for adoption by the Planning Commission, TIDA and the Board of Supervisors after
    certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report/Statement (EIR/S) which may take
    place in December 1998. The informational presentation will describe the direction the
    planners are going in proposing specific activities, public spaces, public facilities, and
    buildings proposed for the Islands. Copies of the Draft Reuse Plan are available for pick
    up at the Planning Department, 1660 Mission Street, 5th Floor Receptionist at a cost of
    $5.00. For further information, please contact Paul Rosetter at 558-6326.

250 STEUART STREET
, Assessor's Block 3741, Lots 11, 21, 25, 27, 28 and 33 -- The
    GAP Building - Consideration of approval of a Resolution finding Amendments to the Rincon
    Point-South Beach Redevelopment Design for Development Document in conformity with the
    General Plan and Section 101.1 of the Planning Code. 


Note:
 This activity is within the scope of a program approved earlier,
    and the program EIR along with subsequent environmental documents adequately describes the
    activity for the purposes of CEQA.
 


SPEAKERS: Gram Wyatt, David Madway, Amy Nonched
 


ACTION: Approved as modified: 


4) The original intent of the Planning Code in limiting signs to under 100 feet
    above grade was to avoid a proliferation of brightly lit, roof-level signs throughout the
    downtown, competing with each other and obscuring the overall form of the skyline,
    particularly at night. However, San Francisco has a tradition of allowing corporate
    identity signs of locally-based and founded corporations (Ghiradelli, Pacific Bell, Hills
    Brothers). Since the sign is incised and indirectly illuminated, it appearance is subdued.
    A very limited number of signs of subdued nature would not be in conflict with the intent
    of the General Plan and the Planning Code.
