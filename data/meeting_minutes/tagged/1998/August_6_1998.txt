REAR YARD VARIANCE
SOUGHT:
 The proposal is to construct a two-story-over-garage addition at the
front of the lot and connect it to the existing legal non-conforming, single-family
dwelling at the rear of the subject lot via a ground level corridor.  The bulk of the
expansion will be at the front of the lot and is code-complying.  However, a
portion of the proposed one-story, ground-level, 13'-9" by 20'-0" corridor
connecting the existing house with the bulk of the proposed addition would be
located in the required rear yard, and would therefore require a rear yard
variance.

3).  About 53,800 sq.ft. would be added to floors 2-17 on the north and west
sides of the L-shaped building, and above the roof (but not above the existing
parapet),  for a total of approximately 257,700 sq.ft. in building area. Two new
floors would be created where existing floors with high ceilings would be divided
horizontally. The building is recognized by the City  to have significant
architectural character. The project requires approval under Section 309 for
Permit Review in C-3 District and a Permit to Alter for major alterations to a
Category I building identified in Article 11 of the City Planning Code.   It would
also require a conditional use authorization for hotel use in the C-3-0 Zoning

B.  
PUBLIC COMMENT




 
At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public
that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With
respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the
item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been
reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the
Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be
exercised during the Public Comment portion of the calendar.  Each member of the public may
address the Commission for up to three minutes.  If it is demonstrated that comments by the
public will exceed 15 minutes, the President or chairperson may continue Public Comment to
another time during the meeting. 




	"The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on
the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public
comment, the commission is limited to: (1) briefly responding to statements made or questions
posed by members of the public, or (2) requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent
meeting, or (3) directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.  (Government Code Section
54954.2(a).)


 
SPEAKERS: 	Edith McMillian

				Re: - glitch in system -- drawings don't match what the
application is for 1914 Filbert; - Rose Court--the neighbors are
not against the project but are concerned that the project
sponsor seems to be working more with Heritage than with
them.


				Jake McGoldrick


				Re: Appeal of CPC unanimous decision to not allow demolition
of a sound house at 1725 Lake Street.  The Board upheld your
decision by a vote of -2 +1.  It was  disturbing that it appears
that BOA seems to be establishing a policy to overturn	 CPC
decisions.  Also felt that Mr. PASSMORE might defend the
CPC decisions with a bit more strength.


				Brett Gladstone


				Re: 3100 Webster -- Clients are requesting a 60 day
continuance to apply for a CU without a termination date, or a
termination date 50 or 60 years out.  The 90 day period for
Commission action could be extended by a member of the
Board--currently being considered by Supervisor Katz.


				Sue Hestor


				Re: - request further continuance date for #8 ( 3175 17th
Street) to 8/27.


				- 725 Tehama Street -- At the Board, staff submitted the case
report that represented the department staff position and a two
page cursory summary of the Commission position (and did
not tell her).  There should be a policy on a contested case
where when the project is denied the staff automatically
notifies both sides.  And there should be policy that staff does
not submit a position that is not the Commission's.


				Mr. Scott 


				Re: 3100 Webster Street -- concerned that all of the
neighborhood's options in relation to the possible rezoning
are not lost.

Mills
: Congratulate our Director.  Mr. Green has been appointed to the
Executive Committee of ABAG.  Also in October, he will be given the Outstanding
Achievement Award at Cal Poly from the School of City and Regional Planning.


 
Antenore
:
 
Appeals of CPC decisions and how our decisions get
communicated to the body appealed to is important and we need to have further
discussion of this in some appropriate manner.  Request that we consider some
form of discussing it in greater depth and how we are going to make sure that our
decisions and the reasons behind them are getting adequately communicated.


 
Chinchilla
: Directed that Mr. Green and Mr. PASSMORE get together and
consider that and report back under Director's Report as to what the current
procedures are, what the Department's historical participation in that process has
been and whether there is any room for change or whether we need to calendar it
for discussion and policy implementation by the Commission.   


 
Green
: Question for clarity: Are you asking for a discussion about the normal
procedure on how your items get presented to the Board?  Not necessarily
whether or not the decision developed a policy but how we present the outcome
of your deliberations before the Board of Appeals?


 
Chinchilla
: Right.  How it has been done in the past.  What has been the role--is it merely objective reporting, or is it more of an advocacy role?  Report back on
the actual procedure, where there might be a need for improvement, or whether
you need the Commission to set a policy on how we want our decisions
presented on appeal (Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals).  Put this on
the "to do" list.


 
Green
 in response: We will report back next week as to a date to actually
have a discussion.


 
Hills
: - Requested that the Commission get the copy of BOA agenda prior to
their (BOA) hearing rather than receive them in our folders after their hearing.


 
Theoharis
: The last Commission had a case before the BOA that they asked
the City Attorney for a ruling on as to what is appropriate for a Commissioner as
far as sending a letter to the BOA or being at the BOA in support of a decision
that the Commission has made.  Directed staff to add that to your findings so we
can know what we could or couldn't do.


 
Antenore
: The last question by Commissioner Theoharis should also be
addressed to the City Attorney for possible legal implications.

	15.
	REVIEW OF PAST WEEK'S EVENTS AT THE BOARD OF APPEALS &  		BOARD OF SUPERVISORS


 
BOA: - 1725 Lake Street--the Commission denied the request to demolish--Commission decision upheld +1 -2.  Board was supplied with the staff case report
and recommendation.  They were also supplied with a summary of the
Commission decision and the reasons for that decision.


		    - 723 Tehama St. case - Mr. PASSMORE has requested a re-hearing of
this case because it appears that Ms. Hestor did not receive adequate notice.


		    - 3100 Webster Street - last week Mr. PASSMORE noted that a decision
of the Planning Commission on a reclassification of property requires a two
thirds vote of the Board of Supervisors to overturn--he was wrong.  A recent
Charter change has amended the Planning Code and a rezoning initiated at the
Board now only requires a majority vote to overrule the Commission.


	-311 notifications: in re-looking at this procedure we are discovering that in
use it does seem to be inadequate.  The form has not been changed since the
adoption of 311.  Staff has been asked to look at this process and recommend
ways to improve it.  We will submit a redraft of the form for review by the public
and you by the first week in September.  We hope to be able to put an approved
improved redraft of the form into use the first week of October.  (Commissioner
Mills requested that these due dates be placed on the Commission "to do" list.)

office space, including the addition of office space in  new mezzanines within
the existing first and third floors and the addition of approximately 6,900 square
feet of office space in a newly-constructed single-story penthouse, for a total of
approximately 58,840 square feet of office space, within a C-2 (Community

SPEAKERS: Joe Luttriell, Sue Hestor, David Cincotta


	ACTION: Approved as amended: 


	D.


 
			The Negative Declaration for the Project indicates that the Project
site is well-served by transit.  Six Muni bus lines and two Golden
Gate Transit lines pass within two blocks of the Project site.  All of
these transit lines operate with available capacity, and thus have
excess capacity to absorb additional transit trips generated by the
Project.


 


			Pursuant to Chapter 38 of the San Francisco Administrative Code,
each developer of a development in the Downtown Area that
includes the addition of new office use must pay a Transit Impact
Development Fee (TIDF) which is related directly to the incremental
financial burden imposed upon Muni both for initial capital outlay
for acquisition of equipment and facilities construction, and for the
long-term operation, maintenance and replacement of those
facilities.    The Project site is within the Downtown Area as defined
in the ordinance and the Project Sponsor shall be required to pay a
TIDF upon the issuance of a temporary permit of occupancy and as
a condition precedent to issuance of any certificate of final
completion and occupancy, whichever occurs first.  Based on the
proposed addition of 52,715 gross square feet of new office space in
this Project, and a TIDF rate equal to $5.00 for each gross square
foot of office use, the Project Sponsor would be required to pay a
TIDF of $263,575.

CONSERVATION


 
	d.	As discussed in the Negative Declaration for the Project, the Project
will not have a significant effect on Muni transit service or
overburden streets or neighborhood parking.  The Project area is
well-served by transit, with several major cross-town lines nearby
on Sansome and Battery Streets, Broadway and The Embarcadero,
all of which have excess capacity.  The Project site is within the
Downtown Area, and pursuant to Chapter 38 of the San Francisco
Administrative Code, the Project Sponsor will be required to pay a
Transit Impact Development Fee (TIDF) upon issuance of a
temporary permit of occupancy or a certificate of final completion
and occupancy.    Based on the proposed addition of 52,715 gross
square feet of new office space in this Project, and a TIDF rate equal
to $5.00 for each gross square foot of office use, the Project
Sponsor would be required to pay a TIDF of $263,575.

REAR YARD VARIANCE
SOUGHT:
 The proposal is to construct a two-story-over-garage addition at the
front of the lot and connect it to the existing legal non-conforming, single-family
dwelling at the rear of the subject lot via a ground level corridor.  The bulk of the
expansion will be at the front of the lot and is code-complying.  However, a
portion of the proposed one-story, ground-level, 13'-9" by 20'-0" corridor
connecting the existing house with the bulk of the proposed addition would be
located in the required rear yard, and would therefore require a rear yard
variance.

 
Zoning Administrator closed public hearing and has stated he will issue a 	decision letter approving the variance.

CONSIDERATION OF FINDINGS AND FINAL MOTION --Public Hearing 		Closed

98.447EZ	 (ROSETTER)

 
3100 WEBSTER STREET
 Consideration of a proposal to amend the zoning
map for the property at 3100 Webster Street, being Lot 12, Assessor's Block
508 (one lot in the block bounded by Webster, Moulton, Buchanan and
Greenwich Streets) from an RH-2 (Two Family Residential) District to an NC-3
(Moderate-Scale Neighborhood Commercial District.  The proposed amendment
would allow the existing Del Sol Motel  (formerly the Plantation Inn) to remain. 
Since the property was reclassified from R-3 (Multi-Family Residential) to RH-2
in 1978, a motel on this property has been a non-conforming use with a
mandate to conform in twenty years (1998).  Conforming to the RH-2 District
would require that the motel be converted to residential use.  Since hotels are a
conditional use in the NC-3 District, the reclassification would allow the motel to
continue with any expansion or intensification as a hotel requiring a conditional
use authorization from the Planning Commission.  The Planning Commission
may also consider recommending reclassification to an NC-2 (Small Scale
Neighborhood Commercial District) as an alternative.

 
	NOTE
: On August 6, 1998, following testimony, the Commission closed
the public hearing and entertained a motion to approve with conditions. 
The motion failed to carry by a vote of +2 -4, resulting in an intent to
disapprove.  Final language 8/13/98. Commissioner Martin was absent.


	SPEAKERS: Patricia Vaughey


	ACTION (1): Motion to continue one week to 8/20/98


	AYES:	Antenore, Hills, Joe


	NOES:	Chinchilla, Mills Theoharis


	ABSENT:	Martin


	RESULT:	Motion failed to carry




	ACTION (2):	Disapprove proposal with an amendment to the motion:


		WHEREAS, In response to public concerns about certain uses allowed
under NC-3 zoning, the owner of 3100 Webster Street suggested, and the
Department of Planning staff recommended the alternative reclassification
to an NC-2 (Small-Scale Neighborhood Commercial) District which district
controls existing hotels/motels in the same manner as an NC-3 District,
but is more restrictive in the nature of other use permitted.


		THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT, The Commission finds that the
proposed reclassification to an NC-3 or and NC-2 District would be
inconsistent with the most of the eight priority planning policies
established by Planning Code Section 101.1 in that:

BICYCLE TRANSIT ENHANCEMENT PLAN
, Consideration of a proposal to
amend the Planning Code (Zoning Ordinance) by amending Section 155.1 to
clarify definition of and obligations of the responsible City official and the landlord
regarding the provision of bicycle facilities in or for building space leased to the
City and deleting obsolete implementation schedule provisions.  The amendment
would add Section 155.2 to require bicycle parking in privately-owned and City-owned parking garages, and would add Section 155.3 to require shower and
locker facilities be provided in or for new buildings and buildings undergoing
major expansion.  Planning Code Section 155(j) already requires bicycle spaces
in required accessory auto parking facilities.  There is no auto parking
requirement for uses other than residential use in the C-3 (Downtown
Commercial) Districts, so no bicycle parking is required or would be required by
this amendment in downtown buildings except in residential buildings and
buildings primarily used as parking garages.

	REVIEW OF PAST WEEK'S EVENTS AT THE BOARD OF APPEALS &  		BOARD OF SUPERVISORS


 
BOS:	- Historic Signs, Public Art works, and Historical Landmarks
legislation that this Commission recommended was before the
full Board on Monday and was passed through without
comment.  The Massage Parlor legislation also recommended
by this Commission was questioned on the hours of limitation

in case of change of ownership
 to 10:00 p.m.--The Board
amended the legislation to 12:00 a.m.


		BOA:	- Alicia Becirril has moved from our Landmarks Board to the
Board of Appeals--which now gives them a five member
Board.


			- 835 Minnesota St.--a 10 unit live/work project CPC approved
last April reducing the height from 49' to 45', and the owner,
Mr. Nibbi agreed to provide $1000 a unit to the Esprit Park
acquisition fund.  The Board further reduced the height from
45' to 41' and required Mr. Nibbi to provide $1500 per unit to
the park acquisition fund.


			- The Sutro Tower determination by the Zoning Administrator
to re-consider his 1996 decision that the addition of advanced
television antennas on the Tower did not require CU
authorization by the Planning Commission but rather just the
building permit and DR review; and whether the mechanical
equipment at the foot of the transmission building and on top
of the transmission building required CU vs a building permit
application was considered by the Board last night and upheld
by them by a vote of +5 -0.


	RESPONSE TO COMMISSION CONCERNS:


			- Not being aware of the cases that are being appealed to the
Board of Appeals. You have been provided with a list of those
cases currently pending before the BOA that also came before
the Planning Commission.  The Department will do this for you
on a weekly basis.


Mills:
	What about the appropriateness of a member of the Planning Commission
being at the Board of Appeals?


Director Green's Response:
 This was an item brought up at last week's meeting, 


		and the staff will come back to you with a response under Director's
Report on September 3rd.

 GENERAL PLAN, PLANNING CODE TEXT AND ZONING
MAP AMENDMENTS--RESOLUTION OF INTENT TO HOLD A PUBLIC
HEARING TO INITIATE SUCH AMENDMENTS TO FACILITATE THE
RECOMMENDATION OF A MISSION BAY NORTH REDEVELOPMENT PLAN
AND A MISSION BAY SOUTH REDEVELOPMENT PLAN AND
IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
-- On August 20, 1998 the Planning
Commission will consider a Resolution of Intent to initiate the following
amendments to the General Plan, Planning Code and Zoning Maps at a duly
advertised public hearing to be held on Thursday, September 17, 1998 after
certification of a Final Subsequent Environmental Impact Report on these
proposed actions and prior to the adoption of proposed Mission Bay North and
South Redevelopment Plans.



		Consideration of a Resolution of Intent to Initiate amendments to the General
Plan, Planning Code text and Zoning Map for the area of the City commonly
known as Mission Bay, generally bounded by Townsend Street to the north,
Third Street and Terry A. Francois Boulevard to the east, Mariposa Street to the
south and the Interstate 280 and Seventh Street to the west.  Please note that
included within this broad area are four parcels or portions thereof that will not
be included within a Mission Bay North (north of China Basin Channel) or
Mission Bay South Redevelopment Project Area:  Three parcels in two
Assessor's Blocks (AB) are located within the area north of the channel (AB
3796/lots 1 and 2 and AB 3797/lot 1) and a portion of one parcel is located
south of the channel (a portion of AB 3880 running easterly of Third Street and
north of the intersection of Third and Fourth Streets (Seawall Lot 337), which is
owned by the Port of San Francisco.



		On September 17, 1998 the Planning Commission will be asked to consider the
following amendments to facilitate the adoption of a Mission Bay North
Redevelopment Plan and a Mission Bay South Redevelopment Plan:  (1)
Elimination of the current Mission Bay Plan by deleting Part 2 of the Central
Waterfront Plan, an element of the City's General Plan; (2) Adoption of the
current Mission Bay Plan as "Mission Bay Guidelines" which, along with the
general policies of Part 1 of the Central Waterfront Plan and the general policies
of the other Elements of the General Plan, would govern property in the four
parcels which are currently included in the Mission Bay Plan yet would not be
included in a Mission Bay North or South Redevelopment Project Area; (3)
Amendments to maps, figures and text descriptions in various Elements of the
General Plan to reflect the proposed Mission Bay North and Mission Bay South
Redevelopment Plans; (4) Amendments to Article 9 of the Planning Code to
reference Mission Bay Guidelines applicable to the four remaining parcels
rather than a Mission Bay Plan, to reference the Mission Bay North and South
Redevelopment Plans for the Redevelopment Plan Areas, and to describe the
four parcels that would remain subject to the provisions of Article 9; (5)
Amendments to Zoning Map 8 to eliminate specific use districts of Article 9
which would no longer be applicable with the adoption of the Redevelopment
Plans and to continue the use district (Mission Bay Office District) which would
govern property located within the three parcels north of China Basin Channel
which would not be subject to the proposed Mission Bay North Redevelopment
Plan.  Those properties in AB 3796/Lots 1 and 2 and AB 3797/Lot 1 would
continue to be governed by Article 9, the Mission Bay Guidelines, the general
policies of the Central Waterfront Plan and the general policies of the General
Plan.  A portion of Lot 1 of Assessor's Block 3880, under the jurisdiction of the
Port of San Francisco, would not be included in the Mission Bay South
Redevelopment Project Area and would remain designated MB-OS--Mission
Bay Open Space Use District; and (6) Amendments to Zoning Map 8H to
eliminate the height and bulk district designations for the land that would be
governed by the Mission Bay North and Mission Bay South Redevelopment
Plans.   For further information, please contact planner Susana Montana at
(415) 558-6313.

	PACIFIC EXCHANGE:
 North side of Folsom Street, between Spear and Main
Street.  Assessor's Block 3740, Lots 27, 29, 30, 31 and 32.  The proposed
project would expand the existing Rincon Point-South Beach Redevelopment
Area by approximately 60,000 square feet, demolish two existing buildings, and
construct a new headquarters for the Pacific Exchange to accommodate the
Pacific Exchange and the needs of its 550 members and its clearing firms, at
least through the year 2010.  The project would construct a new 17-story, 234-foot tall structure to replace its existing operations now in several locations in the
Financial District.  The new building would include a three-level 550-valet space
parking garage below grade and new trading floors above grade, with offices and
support space to accommodate up to 3,260 employees.  The parking garage
would likely be owned by the City and operated by the City or a non-profit
corporation as a public parking garage.  Above the parking garage, the building
would contain about 425,500 gross square feet of space in two main
components: a 5-story Trading and Technology Center, consisting of about
143,100 gross square feet, and a 17-story office tower, consisting of about
274,000 gross square feet.  The ground floor would contain about 8,400 square
feet of retail space.  The project would require an amendment of the Rincon
Point-South Beach Design for Development document to provide development
standards for the project site.  Conforming General Plan amendments would also
be required.

APPEAL OF THE PRELIMINARY
NEGATIVE DECLARATION.
  The proposed project would reuse three vacant buildings
for 49 live/work units 20,000 square feet of commercial/industrial use, with below grade
parking.  The buildings were part of the former Best Foods industrial facility (Assessor's
Block 4017/Lots 2, 3, 4 and 5).  The existing four lots would be merged into one parcel
and re-subdivided into four parcels with different configurations.  The four-story plus
basement 555 Florida Street building, 8,00 sq. ft. Of commercial/industrial use, with
approximately 41,500 gross square feet, would contain 15 live/work units and about 12
parking spaces below grade with ingress and egress on Florida Street. The two three- to
four-story buildings plus basement at 2828 18th Street, consist of approximately
101,850 gross square feet, and would contain 34 live/work units 12,000 sq. ft. Of
commercial/industrial use and 49 basement parking spaces with ingress and egress on
18th Street.  The exterior dimensions of these buildings would not be changed.  The
primary pedestrian entrance for both buildings would be through a courtyard on Florida
Street.  The project is located in a M-1 (light industrial) Zoning District and a 50-X height
and bulk district.

BICYCLE TRANSIT ENHANCEMENT PLAN
, Consideration of a proposal to amend the
Planning Code (Zoning Ordinance) by amending Section 155.1 to clarify definition of
and obligations of the responsible City official and the landlord regarding the provision
of bicycle facilities in or for building space leased to the City and deleting obsolete
implementation schedule provisions.  The amendment would add Section 155.2 to
require bicycle parking in privately-owned and City-owned parking garages, and would
add Section 155.3 to require shower and locker facilities be provided in or for new
buildings and buildings undergoing major expansion.  Planning Code Section 155(j)
already requires bicycle spaces in required accessory auto parking facilities.  There is
no auto parking requirement for uses other than residential use in the C-3 (Downtown
Commercial) Districts, so no bicycle parking is required or would be required by this
amendment in downtown buildings except in residential buildings and buildings
primarily used as parking garages.

Third Streets, Lot 79 in Assessor's Block 3722, in a C-3-O (Downtown Office) District

proposal is to provide monthly parking at a discounted rate for up to 200 of the 337 net
new automobile parking spaces that would be created if the Planning Commission
approves the request for a new parking garage.  Planning Code Section 155(g) does not
permit discounted parking rates for weekly or monthly periods.  OPEN SPACE
VARIANCE SOUGHT: The proposal is to provide no publicly-accessible open space in
conjunction with the parking garage.   Planning Code Section 138 requires that publicly-accessible open space be provided for new non-residential, non-institutional and non-retail buildings in C-3 Districts.  Based on an area of 133,740 gross square feet of space
subject to the open space requirement, the project would require 2,675 square feet of
open space.

proposed project is to rebuild the third floor (which was previously destroyed by fire) 
and add a fourth floor to a 14,400 square foot two-story building.  The building would be
converted from office/warehouse/industrial use into 12 live/work units with 12 ground
floor parking spaces.  The proposed building would total 20,800 square feet with a
building height of 50 feet.  The existing project site is located in a C-M (Heavy
Commercial) zoning district, within a 50-X height/bulk district.  It is also located within
the Greater Northeast Mission Industrial Zone (NEMIZ).
