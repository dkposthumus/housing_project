		SAN FRANCISCO MUNICIPAL RAILWAY THIRD STREET LIGHT RAIL
 --

Public Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental
Impact Report.
  The San Francisco Public Transportation
Commission/Municipal Railway (Muni), in cooperation with the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA), proposes to construct a new light rail transit (LRT) line into
the southeastern quadrant of the City.  The EIR/EIS analyzes the potential
environmental impacts (physical changes to the environment) of three alternative
projects: the No Project alternative, the No Build/Transportation System
Management (TSM) alternative and the Light Rail alternative.  The No Project
alternative would perpetuate existing conditions in the Third Street Corridor; the
No Build/TSM alternative would meet increased transit demand via expanded
bus service; and the Light Rail alternative would extend Muni light rail service in
two phases.  The Initial Operating Segment (IOS) would extend light rail from
King Street to the Bayshore Caltrain Station via Third, Fourth and Bayshore
Boulevard.  A later Central Subway phase would extend service northward to
Chinatown via Third/Fourth, Geary and Stockton.  In addition, a new light rail
maintenance and storage facility would be constructed on one of two alternative
sites.

		Note:  Written comments will be received at the Planning Department until
5:00 p.m., on May 19, 1998.

REQUIRED ARTWORK AMENDMENT
 - - Consideration of a proposal to amend
Section 149 of the Planning Code (Zoning Ordinance) to expand the options where
artwork required for buildings in the C-3 Districts can be provided.  Currently, Planning
Code Section 149 requires that 1% of the construction cost to build or expand a building
in the C-3 District to more than 25,000 square feet be expended on artwork that must be
installed and maintained in one of the following locations:  (i) in areas on the site of the
building or addition and clearly visible from the public sidewalk or the building's open-space feature required by the Code or (ii) on the site of the building's open-space
feature required by the Code, or (iii) upon the approval of any relevant public agency, on
adjacent public property, or (iv) in a publicly accessible lobby area of a hotel.  The
proposed amendment would add, for a period of three years, a fifth option for artwork
placement; that of placement in, upon or part of publicly-visible ornamental features of
architecturally significant buildings that are located in the C-3 District or in "P" Districts
adjacent to the C-3 District..

OMNI SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL- PUBLIC HEARING ON DRAFT EIR
:  The project
would develop an approximately 362 - room hotel with an 5,000 sq. ft. ground floor
restaurant and 1,000 sq.ft. retail space in an existing building that is currently a vacant
office structure located at 500 California Street, at the corner of Montgomery Street
(Assessor's Block 240, lot 3).  About 53,800 sq.ft. would be added to floors 2-17 on the
north and west sides of the L-shaped building, and above the roof (but not above the
existing parapet),  for a total of approximately 257,700 sq.ft. in building area. Two new
floors would be created where existing floors with high ceilings would be divided
horizontally. The building is recognized by the City  to have significant architectural
character. The project requires approval under Section 309 for Permit Review in C-3
District and a Permit to Alter for major alterations to a Category I building identified in
Article 11 of the City Planning Code.   It would also require a conditional use
authorization for hotel use in the C-3-0 Zoning District.

		299 DOLORES STREET- PUBLIC HEARING ON THE DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL
IMPACT REPORT
:  Holy Family Day Home.  Northeast corner of !6th and Dolores
Streets. Assessor's Block 3556, Lot 25:
 
The project would demolish a three-story 
building with frontage on both Dolores and 16th Streets.  A new, two-story, building
would be constructed on the same part of the site.  The building to be demolished was
designed by Willis Polk and Company, and was determined to appear eligible for listing
on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).  The building was used for child
care from about 1912, until the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.  A building constructed in
1984 would remain and continue to provide classrooms and other facilities for child care,
and two, one-story, 960-sq.-ft. temporary buildings would be removed after project
construction.  The new building would continue the child care use, adding about 50
children to the approximately 100 existing children, for  a total of 150 children. There
would be a net reduction of about 2,830 sq. ft. at the site.  The site  served 150 children
prior to 1989, and now serves 100 children.  The new building would enable the site to
serve 150 children, with approval of an amendment to the existing Conditional Use
authorization. 

		NOTE: COMMENTS WILL BE ACCEPTED UNTIL 5 PM,  MAY 14, 1998, OR THE
