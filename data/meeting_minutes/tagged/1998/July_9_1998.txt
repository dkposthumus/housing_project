respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the
item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been

C. 
COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS


- Chinchilla: Update "Action" list


- Mills: Recently attended meeting where focus was Transit First Policy.  After
adopting this policy we never carried out a land use policy that reinforced it.  The
Department had some maps that showed the routes of the transit lines so you
could see which were most heavily served by transit.  Request that a couple of
those maps be available at CPC hearings so when certain projects come up we
can pinpoint location and see how they relate to what this framework was
suppose to be about.

		475 BRANNAN STREET
-- 
Certification of Environmental Impact Report.
 The
proposal is to renovate and expand an existing office building (former
warehouse) at 475 Brannan Street, between Third and Fourth Streets
(Assessor's Block 3787, lot 31), with addition of parking.   The project would add
two stories to an existing two-story-plus-basement building, increasing floor
area from approximately 180,000 gross square feet (gsf) to about 245,500 gsf. 
Office space would increase from 180,000 gsf to 241,000 gsf, and a portion of
the ground floor would contain approximately 2,500 gsf of retail space.  An
existing 71,000 sq.ft. basement would be converted to a parking garage for
about 160 vehicles.  Off-street loading would be provided through two new
loading docks constructed on the east side of the building and accessible from
Brannan Street via a private on-site alley.  The project would require a rezoning
of the existing 50-foot height limit to 65 feet to permit construction of the project,
which would be up to approximately 58 feet in height.  The rezoning must be
approved by the Board of Supervisors.  This project is located in an SSO
(Service Secondary Office) zoning district. 

		Note:
 Public comment and testimony is NOT taken by the Planning
Commission hearings for certification of Final Environmental Impact
