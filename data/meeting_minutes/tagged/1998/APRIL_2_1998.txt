    Department staff, and other interested parties.
 


Findings:
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
 


4. During the hearing before the Commission
 The Department has received
    conflicting testimony regarding the date that the unit in question was established.
    According to documents from the Department of Building Inspections, the unit was
    established prior to 1960. A previous tenant and a current tenant in the building have
    testified that the unit existed prior to the purchase of the building by the applicant.
    However,
 several tenants of the building 
have
 testified that the
    unit was established within the past two years. No evidence was submitted during the
    hearing to establish that the unit had existed prior to 1960.
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
 


6. 
Although the Commission received some testimony from neighborhood
    residents that the additional unit would not be detrimental
 Strong opposition to
    the unit was received from a number of occupants of the building and from several
    residents in the neighborhood.
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
 


7. The project complies with all applicable provisions of the Planning
    Code.
 


7
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
 8. 
The Residence Element of the General Plan (Objective 3,
    Policy 3) encourages legalizing illegal dwelling units, but only when there is no
    neighborhood opposition.
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
 


8. The evidence before Commission established 
believes
 that
    the current owner established the unit in question without the benefit of a Building
    Permit. 
In order to avoid setting a precedent of encourage the construction of
    illegal units, the Commission feels an obligation to deny the Conditional Use
    Authorization.
