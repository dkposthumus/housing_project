4. Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner Feldstein:


Re:  Correction to the Action List


- Last week she requested information on fees for Discretionary Reviews and requested staff to try to move ahead with whatever action needs to be taken on programmatic EIRs and to reimburse the Department for development in these areas.


Re:  Non Profit Housing Association of Northern California Inclusionary Zoning Survey


- She requested last week that she and all Commissioners receive this information.


Miriam Chion of staff responded to Commissioner Feldstein's Request:


- She will provide copies of the Non Profit Housing Association of Northern California Inclusionary Zoning Survey to all Commissioners.


Re:  October 1, 2003 - Performance Measures and Customer Service Plan


- Commissioner Bill Lee mentioned that performance measures and a customer service plan must be complete from all departments by October 1, 2003.  


- She requested that this information be available to all Commissioners as soon as possible.


Commissioner Antonini:


Re:  Housing Element


- Members of the public have expressed concerns to him about the length of the staff's presentation on 10/9.   He would like the Acting Director to comment on this.


- He has not received the memorandum referenced in the draft housing element.


- Next week he would like to have a discussion on the document Commissioner Feldstein referenced.


Commissioner Bradford Bell responded to Commissioner Antonini's requested:


- The way the calendar will be presented next week is as follows:


Discretionary Review Policy presentation will be calendared during the Regular Calendar at 1:30 p.m.  The Housing Element will not be scheduled to start before 5:00 p.m.


Commissioner Hughes:


Re:  Time Utilization regarding demolition reports


- He requested that over the next three or four weeks Commissioners think of what would be a good methodology or median standard to set the bar on for exceptions to, or on what does not have to be met in a soundness report.  He believes this would go a long way to assist with time utilization.


Commissioner Bill Lee:


Re:  Work Plan and Budget


- He was not here last week so he did not receive this information.


- He requested to receive, as well as all Commissioners, a printout of the expenditures and costs.  This information should be provided to Commissioners quarterly.  This would provide an opportunity for Commissioners to track the budget from now until next year.  If there are proposed budget cuts, with this information the Commission could support the department in the appropriate areas.


Re: Secondary Unit Legislation from the State


- The State is looking to supercede the secondary units legislation through all the counties.  The League of California Cities and SESAC has asked cities to weigh in on these items.  He requested that this information be provided to Commissioners.


Commissioner Bradford Bell:


Re:  Staggered Meeting Scheduled


- She requested that the Commission discuss this issue.


Commission Secretary:


Re:  Staggered Meeting Schedule


- The Commission has had a chance to weigh the pros and cons of scheduling different types of cases on alternating hearing dates.  Staff wants to know how to proceed for the remainder of this year.  Do they go back to scheduling all types of cases on all hearing dates or do they continue with the alternating schedule?


- She informed the Commission of the heavy hearing schedule for their Oct. 16 hearing.  She recommended that the meeting start at 12:30 p.m. and schedule the Eastern Neighborhoods item to not start before 6:00 p.m.


Re:  Vacation Schedules


- She requested that Commissioners let her know their vacation schedules as soon as possible so she can determine if there will be any quorum problems.


C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


5. Director's Announcements


Re:  Housing Element


Teresa Ojeda from staff presented the following documents:


1) Memorandum summarizing the concerns they have received regarding the Housing Element.  These concerns are from the public and Commissioners.  The memorandum also provides a summary from staff of these concerns.


2) Set of slides of maps and diagrams that are the overlays requested by Commissioner Bill Lee.


3) Letters from the Mayors Office of Housing and the Redevelopment Agency that provides information on the financial implications of not having a Housing Element.


All these documents will be available at the department and will be available online.


On the day of the hearing, the agenda will be as follows:


1) Staff will start with a short presentation providing an overview of the public input they have received and how they have addressed these concerns.


2) A description of the process of adoption and approval and certification of the Housing Element.  All of this should not take more than 10 minutes.


If the Commission has any instructions, they should convey them by Monday.


Acting Director gave the following report:


Re: Question Commissioner Hughes raised regarding criteria used to determine whether a project is affordable or not and if not should it be brought before the Commission:


- The majority of the Commission felt that if a project is not affordable it should not be brought before the Commission.


- The criteria used is for one-to-three family housing is 80 percent of the median income which calculates to $1.2 million.  If the existing housing that is being demolished is $1.2 million dollars or more, the project is reviewed at staff level and decides it.


- Should the single family to three family median housing index or should the median housing index for the entire city be used?  The single family to triple family medium housing price results in an affordability cut off at 1.2 million while the average medium price for housing as a whole results in approximately 9.3 million.


Re:  Programmatic EIRs:


- He is working with the City Attorney on this already.


- Paul Maltzer met with the City Attorney on this last Friday.


- He believes that State law allows you to collect money when a project has been put forth.


Re:  Full Recovery of DRs:


- There was a question on full recovery of DRs.


- Last week, this was discussed during our budget item.


- Staff is proceeding with the City Attorney on this to understand what to do with applications; to provide proper notice to applicants upfront that the Department is seeking full recovery and identify what charges are.  The portion of the Planning Code that allows reduction of fees due to limited income or non-profit status will also be noticed.


Re:  Next Week's Calendar:


- He informed the Commission that the DR Policy item on calendar next week will also seek to allow an initiation of an administrative review and decision process.

6. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals


BOS - 


Land Use Committee:


The Land Use Committee which consists of Supervisors McGoldrick, Maxwell, and Ammiano, met this past Monday (September 29, 2003) and  considered a couple of minor Planning related items:


[Lot Line Selection for Vacant Lots Abutting Two or More Streets]


It heard Supervisor McGoldrick's Ordinance amending Planning Code section 130 dealing with lot lines. The item was passed out to the full board on a 3-0 vote.


[Planning Code Amendment--Mining Exchange Building Setback]


The Committee approved an Amendment to Appendix B of Article 11 of the Planning Code that is required for this Project at 350 Bush Street to allow a setback of a minimum of 30 feet instead of 60 feet over the Mining Exchange Building. The building was  sculpted with the 30 foot setback in order to maintain the view of the Russ Building Courtyard).


[Seawall Lot 330]


Approved a General Plan Amendment as well as a Zoning Map Amendment in connection with Seawall Lot 330.  


Full Board of Supervisors Meeting - September 29, 2003:


The Board voted on a motion by Supervisor Daly creating a City Planning Audit Select Committee to review and implement recommendations of the Budget Analyst's Management Audit of the Planning Department for the Board of Supervisors in June 2002.   This select audits committee is expected to meet for 120 days, or 4 months from its initial meeting.  Board President Matt Gonzalez appoints 3 members of the Board of Supervisors to this select committee.


(It is important to note that Department staff have taken steps to examine and address the recommendations of the audit, and President Bradford Bell called for a hearing before this Commission next month to examine the audit.  I recommend that the Commission hear this matter and submit its recommendations to the Board of Supervisors' select committee for their consideration. We look forward to a process of working closely with members of the Board of Supervisors to examine the recommendations of the audit.


Appeals


- No appeals before the full board until Tuesday, October 21, when the Board will consider 2 items:


- Appeal of a CU authorization for 6 Verizon antennas at 5630 Mission Street (Gonzalez, Daly, Peskin, Sandoval and McGoldrick).


- EIR appeals for the projects at 201 Folsom/300 Spear Streets.


Note: 
 He placed in the Commissioner's packet for next week's meeting a communication that includes recently introduced legislation by members of the Board of Supervisors.  Commissioner Sue Lee made this request to provide the Commissioners Planning-related legislation by members of the Board.  This will provide more time to study the many pieces of legislation before they are brought before the Commission for recommendation.  This will become a regular part of the weekly information packets from staff.


BOA - 


Re:  473 Leland Avenue


- This project was a demolition which the Commission denied.

RE:  400-410 Vallejo Street

GOLDEN GATE PARK CONCOURSE AUTHORITY PROJECTS

The Project includes a ground lease to the Music Concourse Community Partnership ("MCCP") of a portion of lot 001 in Assessor's Block 1700 in Golden Gate Park, located in the vicinity of the Music Concourse, primarily between the De Young Museum and the Academy of Sciences, issuance of revenue bonds to facilitate the financing and construction of an underground parking facility at the Golden Gate Park Music Concourse, as contemplated by Proposition J, approved by City voters in June 1998.  Debt service on the Bonds would be paid from revenues generated by the operation of the parking facility and MCCP's philanthropic fundraising programs.  In addition to the ground lease and financing proposal, the Golden Gate Park Concourse Authority, the Project Sponsor, is seeking the approvals necessary for the construction of a new underground parking facility and associated surface improvements in the Golden Gate Park Music Concourse and certain Transportation Implementation Plan ("TIP") Elements in Golden Gate Park.  The underground parking facility would contain approximately 800 spaces at the Music Concourse.  The Project proposes to incorporate surface transportation improvements in the Concourse area, and throughout Golden Gate Park, including removal of approximately 200 parking spaces from the Music Concourse area and a total of 800 surface parking spaces from Golden Gate Park, after construction is completed.  The underground parking facility would be generally located under the existing Tea Garden Drive and Music Concourse Drive in Golden Gate Park, directly adjacent to the New de Young Museum to the north and directly adjacent to the Academy of Science to the south, in a P (Public) District and an OS (Open Space) Height and Bulk District.
