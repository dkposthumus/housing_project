B. COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
 


4. Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner Sue Lee:


- She requested that staff calendar for discussion the subject of alternating DR and CU calendars just to get feed back from the Commissioners, staff and public.  She would like an opportunity to evaluate how this is going.


Acting Commission Secretary Jonas Ionin responded:


- Recommended that the next available hearing would be December 11, 2003.


Commissioner Lisa Feldstein:


1) She received from Mr. Samaha of staff some legislation regarding a special use district.  She was under the impression that there was to be some legislation in the CPC Folder that was introduced by Supervisor Daly -- it was supposed to be in their correspondence folder.


Acting Director responded:


- He will check on that.  He is aware that whenever legislation comes into the office it is immediately forwarded to the Commission via their correspondence folders.


2) She attended the annual conference of the California County Planning Commissioners Association.  She discovered that they have nothing in common with any other county including the fact that they [other counties] get paid a lot more to work fewer hours.  The conference was very interesting to her.  One of the things that struck her was although the issues that other counties are dealing with have to do with the interfaces between the cities within those counties and the surrounding lands, some of the solutions that the counties have crafted for diverse uses of land "bumping" up against each other would be helpful to the Commissioners to consider as they continue to look at uses of industrial land.  Especially in regards to the interaction between agricultural land and housing where many of the same issues: noise, machinery, equipment and chemicals comes up.


3) She requested that the hearing be adjourned in memory of Nicholas Summerfield who was a kindergarten student at her daughters school who was struck by a car on his way to school on Tuesday of this week.


Commissioner Antonini:


1)  He spoke before the North Beach Neighbors regarding Commission issues.


2) RE:  The Mills Corporation question that has come up about usage.  He realizes that this might be a Port issue but he wanted to bring this up to the Commission and to the Acting Director as well as the City Attorney.  He wants to know if the Commission has any jurisdiction on this.


3) There was an article in the San Francisco Business Times regarding the Century and the Transbay Terminal.  There was mention that the City has moved the Transbay Terminal 100 feet to the west.  He wants to know what procedure there should be on this and whether or not the Commission should be involved on this.


Commissioner Boyd:


- He thanked staff for the hard work that everyone has done.


- The Commissioners always have requests and staff has always been available and quick in providing information.


Commissioner Bradford Bell:


- She sent her condolences to the family of Nicholas Summerfield.


- She congratulated the Commissioners on their first year as Commissioners.


C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


5. Director's Announcements


Re:  Bloomingdale's/Emporium Project


- He attended the "groundbreaking" ceremony for this project.


- He was delighted to get this project "off the ground".


- The area has not been too pedestrian friendly.  This project will be a wonderful thing for the area.


Re:  Calendars


Re: Future Calendars


- The Commission calendars are really full over the next month and a half.


- He asked for the forbearance of the Commissioners.


Re:  Director Green


- Director Green will be attending the November 20, 2003 hearing.


Re:  Question from Commissioner Antonini:


- The Mills Corporation project on Pier 27-31, he believes that this project came before the Commission as a general plan referral.  If there are significant changes in the project it is conceivable that it would have to come back to the Commission.


Re:  The Century Project


- This is also known as Natoma Mews and 72-80 Natoma.  This is a residential project that was approved by the Commission for the last time in the late 90s.  It is a 400 foot tall residential building with about 500 units.  They have commenced construction but there was a delay.  In the Business Times there was some concern that with the Transbay Terminal moving East it might be on this site or there might be a conflict on this site.  DBI needs to make a decision on this.  If the project is still in general conformity with the plans then they can proceed.  He believes that the Department cannot hold a project that is entitled because the City or the Redevelopment Agency or MTA has other plans for the project.  If ultimately the City or the Agency or other government agency believes that they need that property for the Transbay Terminal it is up to that entity to come to a negotiated settlement with the project sponsor or proceed in inverse combination.  The department acting as a permit processing department in this case is opposed to a long term planning process, the department must process the permits or else the department would be subject to suit for delaying the project.


Re:  Commissioner Boyd's Comments


- He thanked Commissioner Boyd for complementing staff.

6. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals


BOS - None


BOA - 


- There were eight items that dealt with the Planning Department and there were three that dealt with decisions made by the Commission.


Re:  701 Lombard Street


- The request to reopen this case failed by a vote of +2 -2.


- There was a case heard under Discretionary Review.  A homeowner wanted to have a funicular installed in his home because he could not go up the stairs.  The Commission approved this project.  This went to the BOA and they upheld the Commission's decision.


Re:  1331 Green Street


- This property is where Imogene Cunningham used to live.


- The Commission had disapproved, upheld the variance that was disapproved.  The Commission disapproved a new building in front.  There was a proposal to change that so that proposal failed so the building is still going to be built in the front.


D. REGULAR CALENDAR

7.  (L. BADINER: (415) 558-6411)


COMMISSION ACTION LIST
 - Discussion of status on items on the action list, which details the Planning Commissioner's requests.


Commissioner Antonini:


1)  He wants to know the status on a Spreadsheet from the dollars of all governmental resources that have been allotted toward affordable housing in San Francisco.


Response by Acting Director:
  MOH/RED are putting this information together.


2) What is the status of a joint hearing with the Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors?


Response by Acting Director:  
At the November 20, 2003 hearing there will be discussion on the management audit.  There are some requests for that.  This can be taken up at that time.  The BOS will be organizing an audit committee and they will be working on how the Board of Supervisors and the Planning Commission want to work in a more formal way.


Commissioner Hughes:


- He requested that an item on July 24, 2003 be deleted because it was more of a comment rather than a request or action item.


Commissioner Sue Lee:


- She requested that all items that have been resolved be deleted.


Commissioner Bradford Bell:


1) She requested that staff look at the 2004 calendar and start scheduling joint hearings.


Response by Acting Director: 
He recommended that perhaps at a hearing in February of 2004, there could be staff from various departments come to provide presentations.


2) She requested that joint hearings be separate from presentations made by staff of various departments.


Response by Acting Director:
  He recommended the following department and/or Commissions be grouped together in separate hearings.  For example:


1) Department of Parking and Traffic and MUNI hearing.


2) Redevelopment Agency and Mayors Office of Housing hearing.


3) Department of Building Inspection (only) hearing. 


4) Arts and Environmental Commission joint hearing. 


Commissioner Feldstein:


- She expressed her appreciation of the explanation from Acting Director Badiner on the difference between informational hearings and joint hearings.


- She requested that the Action List include the reason why the Commission requested departments and Commissions.  That way there is a logical way to proceed.


- There may be other entities that the Commission might want to hear from.  For example if there is a MUNI presentation, there might be other minor agencies which might want to attend like the bicycle coalition.


SPEAKER(S): None


ACTION: Other than direction through discussion, there was no formal Commission action.

Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions

- The project will contain set backs to reduce the massing.  Each floor does have access to the back yard with open space, etc.

The existing lot is 37.5 feet wide, and the two newly created lots would be 18.75 feet wide, with an area of 1,875 square feet.  The site is within an RH-1 (Residential, House, Single-Family) Zoning District with a 40-X Height and Bulk designation.


Preliminary Recommendation: Disapproval


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Bruce Bauman - Representing Project Sponsor


-
 This project is necessary and desirable because it will provide housing.


- The Planning Department is recommending disapproval because it is precedent setting.  He has worked on various projects in the neighborhood that have already set a precedent.


- Housing of this size is appropriate, compatible and desirable.


- If there were vacant lots, he would have to look closely to see if it would provide viable housing.


(+) Mike Murray - Project Sponsor


- He has done a study of the surrounding properties and the majority of the housing consists of two-bedroom units.  He has done this study within a 12-block radius.


- He displayed photographs of the various homes that have a large square footage.


(+) Paraic O'Donaghue


- He continued displaying the photographs the previous speaker had started to present.


(+/-) Fredded Person


- He would like to see something that is better than what is there now.


- He supports the project.


(+) Leroy Moore


- He has been living in the neighborhood since 1942.


- This project is a good idea.  It would be nice to have a new development in the neighborhood.


(+) Marvin Smith


- He was raised in the neighborhood.


- He too would like to see housing as well as provide employment to the young people in the neighborhood.


(+) Mack Burton


- He owns a small construction company.


- He was raised in the area.


- There are so many substandard houses in the neighborhood.


- It would be an asset for the neighborhood as well.


(+) Sergio Iantorno


- He used to own the house next door to the proposed site.


- The Commission is concerned about the size of the project but in the eyes of a lay person, they cannot distinguish between a 30 or 40 foot wide project.


- The new houses will provide housing for a family, which is very much needed.


- He supports this project.


(+) Berry Casey


- He hopes that the Commission will approve the project.

 - southeast corner of  Lot 018 in Assessor's Block 1608 - Request for Conditional Use Authorization under Planning Code Section 711.81 to create a large institutional use at the second story. The proposal is to demolish the existing one-story commercial building at the southeast corner of the intersection and to construct a horizontal expansion to the existing church and daycare center located to the east and known as Full Life Christian Center.  The proposed two-story, 40-foot tall addition would contain two retail spaces (approximately 1,275 square feet each) and a five-car garage at the ground floor and a multi-purpose room at the second story with a rear yard deck over the ground-floor garage. The subject property is within an NC-2 (Small-Scale Neighborhood Commercial) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Rev. John Au-Yeung - Full Life Christian Center


- His church has been in the neighborhood for the last 20 years.


- They serve various age groups of the community.


- They want to promote the community and offer a variety of programs.


- They also would like to have two retail units in order to keep up the business aspects of the neighborhood.


- Their church has been very crowded.


- He urged the Commission to approve the project.


(+/-) Stanley Siu


- He owns property right next to the subject property.


- He has kitchen and bathroom windows that are about 15 feet high.  He is worried that if the building is 40 feet high, he will loose privacy.  If the building is too close to his house, he will lose sunlight.


- He does not oppose the expansion, but would like to have his issues resolved.


(+) Sandra Payne - Full Life Christian Center


- They have various community outreach programs.


- Because of the rain, the children were not able to go trick-or-treating.  With the proposed construction, they would be able to increase their indoor activities.


- There are a lot of after school programs.


- In lieu of having everyone here speak, she asked that supporting members stand up (about 30 people stood up).


ACTION: Approved with Conditions as Modified:  1) modify rear setback; 2) hours of demolition construction on Saturday shall be 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. and no demolition construction work on Sunday.

The property is within an SSO (Service / Secondary Office) District and a 50-X Height and Bulk District.    The original approval for 501 2nd was for a 188,000 square feet of office use and 169 valet parking spaces.

Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Dan Kinsgley - SKS Investments


- They purchased this building knowing that the previous owner was not in compliance with parking.  A mechanical parking lift was a choice.


- It was their opinion that sharing the garage because of the different hours of operation would be just fine.


- This is not going to create any unmet demands in the neighborhood.

EASTERN NEIGHBORHOODS COMMUNITY PLANNING
 - The Planning Commission will discuss and possibly adopt Interim Policies and/or discuss and direct staff to prepare a resolution for initiation of Interim Controls.  Planning Department staff will provide a status report on the Environmental Review process for the Rezoning of the Eastern Neighborhoods.  The Planning Commission will also schedule a subsequent hearing to review and discuss the work scope of Public Benefit Zoning and Community Impact Report (Socio-Economic Analysis) and to discuss non-conforming uses.


Preliminary Recommendation: Adopt Interim Policies


SPEAKER(S):


Michael Yarne - Farella Braun & Martel


- They are involved in the community workshops of Showplace Square.


- They have been exploring the probability of an 800 unit mixed use project.


- He hopes that the EIR can be repaired in the next two years.


- He spoke in favor of interim policies.


- Residential and PDR uses can coexist in the design/showplace square area.


- If the 1 to 4 ratios are enacted, this would impact various projects of his.


- He warns the Commission to look closely at these policies.


Barry Campbell - Bay West Group


- Bay West Group operates the San Francisco Design Center.


- They have participated in every step of the community planning process.


- They are still waiting for an outcome after two years.


- Adding a significant amount of mixed-use housing makes good sense.


- Adopting the interim policies would encourage projects that would make the area safe and a 24/7 district.


- The ratio was never discussed before.


- They fully support the adoption of the policy after modifying the ratio.


Eric Quezada - Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition


- Interim controls have brought them together to discuss important issues.


- They believe that interim controls will allow them not to have to discuss every single project as opposed to policies.


- If there are no interim controls in the next 18 months and the economy gets better, this will get out of control.


- Although they want to look at the goals of the interim controls, the goals of the planning process should be considered as well.


Luis Granados - Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition


- He thanked the Commission for following up on the recommendations made to staff at the previous meeting.


- He is in support of interim controls and not policies.


- PDR businesses will create about 45,000 jobs.


- There is a definite economic business to protecting the businesses.


- He differs from staff on the threshold stated.


- He urged the Commission to direct staff to adopt interim controls.


Charlie Sciammas - MAC


- They are happy that the department is moving forward on the environmental impact analysis.


- The spirit of the rezoning process has been more clearly defined in controls.


- Interim controls are very much needed since currently they have been looking over projects on a case-by-case basis.


My Do - Mission Economic Development Association


- The adoption of interim controls will allow PDR businesses to remain.


- These businesses provide economic viability to the City.


- PDR businesses provide 50.5 million dollars in tax revenue.


Cris Selig (speaking on behalf of Oscar Grande)


- She is in support of interim controls not policies.


- Work upfront will save many hours of work and will cut down long hearings.


- She urged the Commission to move and make a decision tonight.  The content can be thought out and explained in the coming months.


Ada Chan - Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition


- The Eastern Neighborhoods planning process began because of development that occurred, speculation, and the many battles that took place here both in front of this commission and the previous commission.


- The City and the department has spent over $700,000 of planning staff time to develop the plans today.  MAC does not want to be seen as holding developers "hostage."


- They want the small and large developers to have clear guidelines so that no one has to come here again and begin another battle.


- She encouraged the Commission to start the interim controls, defining the legislation in order to schedule a date for that presentation.


Cris Durazo - South of Market Community Action Network


- She encouraged staff to direct staff to pass the resolution.


- She is concerned that she has not heard of a community planning process for West SOMA.


- South of Market faces the most devastation with development if these controls are not imposed and implemented.


Curtis Eisenberger - Mission Coalition for Economic Justice and Jobs


- He thanked staff for their outreach with the Mission Coalition.


- They recently saw the documents so they have not had time to assimilate them.


- He urged the Commission to use caution with the maps of the NEMIZ.  The definition of PDR still needs to be worked on, etc.


- If there is a choice with interim controls to interim policies, they would choose policies.


- The NEMIZ should be looked at in a separate way.


Dick Millet - Potrero Boosters


- The document, which is available to the public, has a lot of inconsistencies and errors.


- He does not want any action today because he has not had time to analyze the document.


Dan Kingsley - SKS Investments


-
 They are owners of various SOMA buildings.


- He received a copy of this document from a neighbor just yesterday.


- It is important to set a standard in sending out these documents, maybe via email.


- There are a lot of concerns with property and business owners about the impacts of non-conforming uses.


- He urged the Commission to accelerate this process.


Fred Snyder


- He is a property owner in the NEMIZ.


- He thanked Larry Badiner for meeting with them and jump-starting their process.


- He feels that there is a need to continue this issue in order to understand what is going on.


- The Mission should be separated in order to talk about it and understand it better.


- Interim controls have already been in his neighborhood for two years.  He believes that this is all they can have.


- It is important to protect the businesses and the jobs.


Judy West


- She lives and works in the NEMIZ.


- She realizes that the current Commission was not present when all the dialog and inconformity was going on so a lot of the essence was lost.


- The Commission needs to think of what would be the impact of buildings in liquefaction zones.


Robert Meyers


- He supports interim policies and not the controls.


- Interim controls would especially harm East SOMA because the area already has the most restrictive zoning in the City.


- Further restrictions would prevent anything at all from being built.


- He wants to focus on staff's proposal for the one new square foot of PDR requirement for each floor square feet of new housing.  This sounds worthy but he believes that it is flawed and would discourage new housing.


- What is the incentive of building larger units if at the same time more PDR space needs to be built that would require a subsidy by the builder.


Julie Milburn - Facilities Director of the California School of Arts and Crafts


- They have a 24 hours school in a very desolate area.


- There are sad, tragic people moving in after dark.


- She is delighted that this process is moving forward.


- They cannot manage with anything more restricting than what they have now.


- 1:4 for PDR is simply way to high.


Tay Via - Coblentz, Patch, Duffy & Bass


- The one specific point that was confusing to them was that people that were involved in the Western SOMA process were very surprised to see this in the interim controls.


- The Western SOMA has been a very active group.


- She suggests that the Commission delete Western SOMA from this process.


Steve Vettel - Dolbe Laboratories


- On page 8 and 9 of the PDR information handout from staff, it states that PDR doesn't exist.  All of a sudden Dolbe Labs would be classified as medium PDR and according to the handout it would become core PDR.


- In overlay districts, core PDR is not permitted.


- He is in favor of interim policies and not interim controls.


Jeffrey Leibovitz


- He lives in Eastern SOMA.  He supports the policies of Eastern SOMA.


- He wants to continue the policy of DR in the Eastern SOMA.


- He does not want to see this process get further politicized.  Everyone has been frustrated with this process.


- Once this document goes before the BOS, there is a possibility that it will be revised.


- The majority of the people of this City have complete confidence in the Commission to take the discretion to decide on policies.


Michael Burke - Elman, Burke, Koffman and Johnson


- His comments are strictly regarding the NEMIZ.


- He read a letter from Lion Enterprises who is the owner of a building at 2525 16th Street.  He requests that you retain the M-1 use in that area.


In the NEMIZ, the residents have been subject to interim controls.


Richie Hart


- He wants to echo the sentiments of the speakers this evening.


- He wants another opportunity to continue public comment.


- If the new guidelines go from 1 to 200, which is higher density, he believes that it is better to stay with the current zoning.


- 4 to 1 PDR would not allow any banks to support builders.


- Housing is harder than it was a few years ago.


- Interim controls are a disaster.
