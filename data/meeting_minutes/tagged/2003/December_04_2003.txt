4.  Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner Bill Lee:


He requested that staff work with the Department of Public Works regarding the placement of PG&E Capacitors on City Streets and set up some guidelines.  Some of these capacitors should be grounded and not on posts.  As part of the priorities for the Planning Department for next year, staff should figure out if there is a way to regulate a placement for these capacitors.


Commissioner Bradford Bell:


- Wished a happy birthday to Jim Nixon.


- Wished a happy anniversary (2 year with the department) to Jean Paul Samaha.


Commissioner Antonini:


- In case the public was not able to see last week's hearing, he had asked for the amendment process to possibly begin on the Housing Element before such time as the environmental review was complete and basically the feeling from the Commission was that that was not what they wanted to do.  


Commissioner Sue Lee:


- Regarding the Board of Supervisors not having a process in place to deal with appeals.  She asked if staff had communicated this question to the Board of Supervisors.


Acting Director Badiner responded:


- He feels that staff has communicated this in an informal way to the Board of Supervisors.  The first of these appeals is coming up next week for 701 Lombard Street.  He was going to make a somewhat impassioned plea at that time.


- Everybody deserves a clear process.


Commissioner Sue Lee:


- She requested that staff submit a letter regarding this issue to the Board of Supervisors.


Jean Paul Samaha:


- Supervisor Peskin has introduced legislation about the CEQA appeals to the Board of Supervisors.


Commissioner Bradford Bell:


- She also wished a happy birthday to Linda Avery.

6. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals


BOS - November 25, 2003 Hearing: 


Land Use Committee Meeting


888 Howard Street


- This was a hotel that was approved by the previous Commission.  It is a 34 story hotel that required rezoning for a height reclassification and some changes in terms of transfer development rights because there were not enough in the District to building this project.  The Staff and the Commission had concerns about open space.  The open space did not meet the solar access guidelines.  The determination was that about 4,000 square feet more of open space should be developed.


- The Board recommended approval of the reclassifications that allowed the project to go ahead.  Without comment, the Board approved it.  He apologized, but does not remember the vote.


BOA:


3632 Sacramento Street


In 1992, the Commission allowed the conversion of a dwelling unit to office on the second floor.  There was a window of opportunity when this could be done legally.  The owner of the building died and the new owner tried to get the permit later but the Planning Department would not allowed it.  This was appealed to the Board.  The City Attorney advised the Board that they could not hear the case but they heard it anyway.  The Board overturned the Commission's decision and allowed the conversion of the dwelling unit.

The site is in a C-3-G (Downtown General Commercial) District and in 150-S and 240-S Height and Bulk Districts. The project is the subject of a concurrent entitlement hearings.


Preliminary Recommendation: Adopt CEQA Findings


(Continued from Regular Meeting of November 13, 2003)


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Eric Tao - AGI Capital


- The project is scaled appropriately for future growth and development of the area.


- The project is consistent with the San Francisco General Plan.


- The project is also designed by an award winning architectural firm.


- The project has also met requirements by various neighborhood groups.


- The EIR has demonstrated that there will be a demand in parking.


(+) John Sheeky - Architects International


- The architect gave a PowerPoint presentation on the architectural aspects of the project.


(+) Jim Haas - Civic Pride

- The mid-Market PAC EIR states that there will be a parking deficit in the next few years.


- Civic Center is a very unique place.


- All the surface parking is disappearing.


- The parking garage will fill a great need to keep the area vibrant and flourishing.


(-/+) Jeremy Nelson - Transportation for a Livable City


- He opposes this project on behalf of TLC.  If one looks at the residential and the commercial, it would be a good project.


- The parking garage is a dead streetscape.


- This City deserves world-class development.


- He recommends that the Commission direct the developer to construct more housing and less parking and to make the 5 stories along Stevenson Street a little bit more active.


- The developer can make a good project even better.


(+) Jim Salinas - Carpenter's Union Local 22


- The members that he represents support this project because the project sponsor has taken his responsibilities very seriously.


- This is a better use for that piece of property.  There is a demand for parking in the area.


- The affordable housing component can only help the City of San Francisco.


- He hopes to see young brothers and sisters start new careers because of this project.


- He asked the Commission to support this project.


(+) Vicky Velarde 


- She lives in Santa Rosa, but comes to enjoy the theatre in the Civic Center area.


- Transportation into and out of San Francisco is very difficult.


- At night parking is difficult and sometimes impossible.


- It would be nice to have a parking garage that would be safe and well lit adding to her ability to enjoy the wonderful City of San Francisco.


(-) Norman Rolfe - San Francisco Tomorrow


- San Francisco already has traffic congestion problems.  It is important to put more people on public transportation.


- Parking breeds autos.


- People should be encouraged to take public transportation and discouraged to drive.


- He would like to limit the residential parking to 1 to 4 and require that the parking be underground.


(-) Cheryl Brinkman - Walk San Francisco


- There are a large number of people who would prefer to walk if the area was safer.


- The blank walls in the existing alley will be very dangerous.


- They have been working very hard to encourage people to walk.


- The Planning Commission should be working with them to increase the safety of the area.

- Their offices are located near the area where the project is being proposed.


- Bike and pedestrian conditions are being improved.

- This parking garage is not necessary so the Commission should oppose it.


(-) David Wilbur - Mid-Market PAC


- He thanked the developers for coming to the mid-Market PAC to present this project.


- It is true that an entertainment district is being planned. But a garage would only cause a lot of congestion.


- Comb the streets; add cafes, bars, restaurants, etc is what needs to be done instead to revitalize the area.


(-) David Snyder - Transportation for a Livable City


- There are various organizations that are opposing the parking garage.


- He requested that the Commission deny this conditional use.


- The reason why the parking demand has not been demonstrated is because the parking garages are not being used to their entirety and car-pooling has not been taken into account.


- This commission should not approve this project until there is a thorough analysis of a multi livable system


(-) Sue Hestor


- The parking garages around the City are very unpleasant to walk by.


- The issue of parking is very huge.


- No one is opposing the housing aspect of this project.  Everyone is only opposing the parking.


- This project will deaden the area.

Preliminary Recommendation:  None:  Informational Presentation


Rick Kaufman - City Core Development


- 333 Fremont Street is a project he is working on.

- Action needs to be taken today and guidance provided to staff in order to apply the policies that the Commission wants to establish.


- There should be a more realistic housing plan.


- There is a suggestion that the view protection plan will assure the creation of a 40 to 60 foot height towers.


- Housing optimization plan is more important than this view protection plan.


Rev. Arnold Townsend


- In this plan any off site affordable housing that is created in Rincon can only be used in Rincon.


- It is difficult to find inexpensive land in the Rincon Hill area.


- It is important to do off site housing.

Trevor Boddy


- He urges the Commission to reconsider all current development applications in the Rincon area.


- It is important to very carefully examine the schemes.


James Haas - Transbay CAC

- The whole motivation started on what to do with the old bus station.


- The issues of financing and what the terminal will look like are still things to look at.


- There is still a lot of Planning to do and the public or the Commission should not rush into things.


Gabriel Metcalf


- The staff has done incredible urban planning design work.


- He is in favor of putting the urban design goal and balancing that with the housing design goals.


- This area is an incredible place to put housing.


- It is irresponsible to put forward exactions without really analyzing and studying the fees.

- He will be working with various companies to prepare this assessment.


Steve Wilson, attorney - representing Archdiocese of San Francisco

- They have taken a quantum leap on this plan but there is still much more that is needed.


- He asks that the Commission give staff more direction.

- One of the things that the department has failed to do is [consider] the dynamics regarding high rise residential buildings.


- He does not dispute the department's desire to promote tower separations.


- Section 270 and 271 cannot be applied.


Roger Brandon


- The area is not a neighborhood, but is part of the downtown business area.


- What kind of people want to live in residential towers in the downtown area?


- This is the densest plan in the City.


- This is all a bad idea.


- This project should not be passed.


Dick Millet


- He is opposed to the 200-foot height limit.

a 20-unit building
 
20 units
 in the Bay View.

- If developers continue to have the option of off-site, affordable housing will be built in various neighborhoods.


- She urges the Commission to direct staff to continue to build off site housing.


Sue Hestor


- She reminded the Commission that there are two presentations from staff.


- The spacing between the towers should be large.


- The Commission needs to direct staff that the public needs independent full urban design information.


- The public would go to the Board of Supervisors with the Commission to request money to be able to have these studies done.

- Everything required for this project has been filed.  Now with this plan, everything has been changed on him.


Joe O'Donaghue


- Everything needs to be analyzed together and there is no financial analysis or model and this is essential.


- The cost of concrete construction is now cheaper than that of frame construction.  The cost of plywood has doubled.


- A lot more data is needed as well as a comprehensive plan.


Steve Vettel


- He commended staff on a very good plan.


- All the comments heard here today should be incorporated into the report.


- At the Bank of America site there are two towers being proposed. 


- In order to do this, the building will have to be demolished.  One thing that surprised him is that there is mention of preserving the tower.  There cannot be a planned unit development if the tower is intended to be preserved.


Bob Meyers


- He urges the support of the 80-foot tower separation and the 250-foot height limit.


- He strongly opposes the staff's preferred option.

RESIDENTIAL DESIGN GUIDELINES
 - Presentation on the revised Residential Design Guidelines (Guidelines) for all residential projects in RH (Residential House) and RM (Residential Mixed-Density) zoning districts.  This is the third and final public hearing on the proposed Guidelines to provide the Planning Commission with all modifications made to the Guidelines after receiving comments and recommendations from the public and the Planning Commission at the May 22, 2003 and the October 23, 2003 hearings, and at follow up meetings held by Department staff with the public. 


Preliminary Recommendation: Adopt the draft version of the December 2003 Residential Design Guidelines as policy.


SPEAKER(S):


Jerry Lax


- He has worked in San Francisco for 24 years.


- He is concerned about some of the limitations associated with the guidelines.


- The projects that he has worked on over the years would not meet the guidelines being proposed.


- He has met with staff and staff has integrated a setback, which he has applied to his projects.


Ron Miguel


- He has commented before on the Residential Design Guidelines.


- There were two comments made today regarding the manner in which the residential design guidelines are being handled throughout the department.  One is that clarity and consistency are very important.  The other is that he was please that the guidelines will not be instituted immediately in order to give time for training of staff.


- Many times there is confusion with the public because of the interpretation from staff when there is no consistency.


- It is important that staff learn how to interpret them so that the public knows where they stand at all times.


John Slessinger - American Institute of Architects


- The idea behind the letter he submitted is just to suggest friendly amendments in future hearings regarding the guidelines.


- They have reviewed the guidelines.


- Some of the most important items to consider are that the Commission and staff recognized that there will be items that will come back during future hearings.  There isn't enough information regarding solar access and solar collectors.  He urges the Commission to direct staff to obtain a companion piece to the guidelines for zoning regulations on this.


- Also, the issue of height and bulk needs to be clear.


Marilyn Amini


- She requested that the Commission not take an action today because it was not available until last Monday.


- The resolution that is before the Commission states that the guidelines will be required in the project design and community response process.  Also the Planning Executive Summary states that there are new issues that need to be addressed.


- The public needs more time to have an opportunity to respond.


- The resolution also has a date of today, but the hearing is just happening.


- If the guidelines were made more specific, it would help planners to solve disagreements.


ACTION: Approved as Amended:


1) Delete solar panel language with the stipulation that staff will continue to work with the relevant departments and bring it back for possible amendments in six months; 2) clean up typos and unclear language; 3) clarify the language on the historical resource section starting on page 49.

 - southeast corner of North Point and Larkin Streets; Lot 026 in Assessor's Block 0020 - Request for Variance from Section 134 of the Planning Code to construct a 4-story residential building into the required rear yard.

Re:  An article in the newspaper


Joe O'Donaghue


- There was an article in the newspaper by L.D. Kiershenbaum.  It attached the credibility of the department and the Director that is not here.


- This article was written by a woman who was very articulate and has come to the Commission many times.


- On the Housing Element, this Commission has spent countless hours reading and working on this document.


- The article is absolutely disgraceful.


- This is just a cowardly act of journalism.  If this lady had comments to make she should have come to this Commission to speak her mind.


- Many of the problems the Department has is related to the budget. That is why many projects cannot go through.
