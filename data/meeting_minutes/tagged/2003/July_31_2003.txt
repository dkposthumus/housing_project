1. Commission Comments/Questions


Re:  Status of Director Green's Departure


Commissioner Feldstein:


Last week I requested that the city attorney provide an opinion on Director Green's comments about his departure.  We have received that but have not had a chance to review it so I wanted to know if it would be appropriate for the City Attorney to walk us through what we have been handed?


Commissioner Antonini:


That would be all right with me.


Deputy City Attorney, Judy Boyajian:


Commissioners, a lot of the opinion is a description of the legal laws and Charter requirements that apply to the Director's leave and the appointment of people to perform some assigned functions while he is away.  I think the short summary at the beginning pretty well sets out the conclusion of the City Attorney, which is that the leave of absence is a policy matter subject to the approval or disapproval of the Commission--the appointing authority.  There was some confusion last week I think about who does the appointment, the Mayor or Commission.


When there is a vacancy in the office of the Planning Director, the Mayor and the Commission share the appointment.  The Commission sends over three names and the Mayor selects from that list.  There is no vacancy, as I understand it.  He will retain the office, he will still be the Planning Director so there is no vacancy.


The Commission only has the authority to remove the Director.  The Mayor can only request that the Commission remove the Director.  So because you have the power to remove or retain the Director, that makes you the appointing authority for the purposes of approving a leave.  The Director, as the Director has authority to assign certain duties to be performed while he is away. It is within his discretion to select a member of the staff to perform those functions that he can delegate while he is absent.


Commissioner Feldstein:


So did you say it is the Mayor's responsibility to approve the leave or it's the Commission?


Deputy City Attorney:


The Commission's.


Commissioner Feldstein:


So that is an action that we have not taken.


Deputy City Attorney:


Well, you have not disapproved it.  I don't think you need to take a formal {action}.  It's sort of like the Director going on a long, long vacation.  I do not think you need a formal act to approve or disapprove.  But it is clearly at your pleasure whether you think that the Director can perform the function of Director as he slated out.  He believes he can.  It is my understanding that he will be back a week a month and be in constant communication.


Commissioner Feldstein:


So would it be the opinion of the Office of the City Attorney that the Director is supposed to make that request of the Commission so that the Commission can evaluate whether or not the Director can perform those functions and make that determination?  The fact that we have neither made nor approved or disapproved the Director's leave is because we have not actually had this discussion.


Deputy City Attorney:


Exactly.  I know that I heard the Director make this announcement many months ago.  I guess there was some unclarity about who's decision it was.  I do not believe you need to take ... He needs to make an official request or an official formal action on your calendar.  I think it's at your pleasure.  Someone wanted to put it on the calendar, you could debate it and act on it.  I don't think that is a legal requirement.


Commissioner Feldstein:


Okay, I will for the fourth time request that this item be calendared for discussion.  I do not need to make a motion.  Thank you, Ms. Boyajian.


Deputy City Attorney:


We also, in the opinion, did indicate that the Director was fully in power to discuss this with the Mayor and get the Mayor's input.  There is no problem with that at all. But, it's the Director's decision who to assign as Acting Director and Acting Zoning Administrator.


Commissioner Feldstein:


So, the Mayor has input, if the Director seeks the input.  The Mayor has input into who the Acting Director and Acting Zoning Administrator is but he [the Director] is not required to seek that input.


Deputy City Attorney:


No, he can ask - the Director can seek the input of anyone he wishes in that decision.


Commissioner Feldstein:


So, the Mayor did not make this decision?


Deputy City Attorney:


It is my understanding that the Mayor did not make this decision.  Maybe the Director will clarify that in his Director announcements.


Commissioner Feldstein:


I believe that the Director was clear about this point last week.  And perhaps the Director wishes to clarify the statements he made last week.  But what I am looking for is an actual legal opinion about the Director's status in this decision making process.  And, what you are saying, as I understand it, is that to the best of your understanding this is what occurred.  And what I am trying to understand is what is supposed to occur.  Whether or not what you understood to have occurred is consistent with what was to have occurred.


Deputy City Attorney:


Yes.  It is consistent with what...  My understanding is that what occurred was consistent with what should have occurred.  The only thing that seems to be unclear is whether the Commission wants to take some formal action on it or just let it be, or not object to the leave.


Commissioner Feldstein:


All right.  I have asked, not during Commissioner comments, but I have asked staff to calendar this item before and it has not been calendared to date.  Hopefully that will occur at this time.


Commissioner Hughes:


Well, I just would like to comment briefly on the leave of Director Green.  San Francisco, in my opinion, is one of, or the best city in the country.  And when institutions like Harvard have the ability to look at comparable cities that have the same sort of complexities and competing interests, that they have a pool of applicants that are well qualified and highly qualified, that they would select and offer that position or that Fellowship to Director Green, I believe this says an awful lot about his ability and his reputation as a Director.  To be recognized by an institution like Harvard, I think is something that is really commendable and should not, in my opinion ... Well what should happen is that you should be able to pursue a Fellowship at a institution like Harvard would be my thoughts on that.


Commissioner Feldstein:


Re:  Changes in CEQA Laws


- She requested a briefing from the City Attorney's office related to CEQA and what actions the Board can take and what votes are required to take specific actions related to projects, etc.


Commissioner Antonini:


Re:  Calendar for September


- A point of clarification on the calendar:  During September we will alternate weeks between Discretionary Reviews (DR) and Conditional Use (CU) cases.  It is his understanding that on some days DRs will be heard first and if time permits, there will be CUs at the end, and the next week it would be reversed.  This will be a trial for September and after that it will be at the pleasure of the Chair.


- This will be on a trial method and [we] may or may not return to the regular way projects have been scheduled.


Commission Secretary responded to Commissioner Antonini's Comment:


- On the days where there are Discretionary Review cases there will not be Conditional Uses or any other matters scheduled on the calendar.  The alternating days will be on the types of cases.  So Discretionary Reviews will be scheduled together on one date and Conditional Uses/Other Matters will be scheduled on another date--not both on the same day.


Re:  Director Green's Departure


- He wished Director Green well and is happy to work with Acting Director Badiner.


Commissioner Sue Lee:


Re:  Discussion on Director Green's Leave Scheduled


- She agrees that it is important to have this issue scheduled because the public needs to know what is the "trickle down" effect of Director Green leaving the Department.  To her, the issue of the Commission taking an action is irrelevant.


Commissioner Bill Lee:


Re
:  Job Performance Reviews


- He would like to have scheduled the job performance review for Planning Commission staff and this should be done on a yearly basis.


RE:  Budget


- He requested budget information and an organizational chart of the Department.


- He would like to know what money was appropriated to meet the goals/objectives of the Department for this year.


- He is still confused on what the priorities of the Department are and what are the priorities of the Commission.


Director Green Responded to Commissioner Bill Lee's Comment:


- The Commission does have an organizational chart in the work program and there will be a hearing in the near future to set the priorities.  


Commissioner Hughes:


Re:  Director Green's Departure


- Is today the last hearing the Director will be in attendance?


- Is there an estimated date of return?


Director Green Responded to Commissioner Hughes's Comment:


- This is the last hearing.


- The program ends in June 2004 and if given the opportunity he would like to return to the Department.


- There is always the opportunity to review this issue.


Commissioner Feldstein:


- Will the Director let the Commission know in advance when he will be returning and what Commission hearing dates he will be attending?


Director Green Responded to Commissioner Feldstein's Question:


- He will provide this information to the Commission.  He will be back in October, November and December and January will not be consistent.


- A calendar will be printed for staff, and the Commission will be provided with this information.


Nilka Julio - Local 21


Re:  Director Green's Departure

2. Director's Announcements


Re:  His Departure


- It was never his intent to confuse, mislead or to add to any tension or difficulty.


- He thought he had all the information.


- He has not had time to review the information provide by the Deputy City Attorney.


- His departure is a leave and he apologized for anything that was misleading.


- He has worked out an arrangement with the Fellowship so that he can return to the office one week out of the month.


- He hopes that the Commission will schedule the discussion on this issue on the days where he will be at the Department.


Re:  Future Calendars


- September 4, would be projects that require Conditional Use, Environmental Review Appeals, etc. and September 11 would be a date for Discretionary Reviews only.


- On days where Discretionary Reviews are scheduled, he hopes that the Commission will agree to schedule presentations/briefings that don't require an action but may help on deliberation for future cases.


Re:  Housing Element


- The 18th and 25th of September would be target dates to schedule this issue.


- If the Commission requires this issue to be discussed on the 18
th
 of September then the alternating schedule will be moved back.  If the decision is to hear this on the 25
th
 of September then there would be no problem as it falls in line with his previous suggestion to hear non-action items on dates reserved for Discretionary Reviews.


Marilyn Amini:


- She requests that the hearing on the housing element not be before October and not to close public comment until San Francisco residents have adequate notice.


- Daily, she meets people that have not heard about the housing element being scheduled.

The subject property is in an RH-1 (Residential, House, Single Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.  


Preliminary Recommendation:  Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project 


as modified.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of July 10, 2003)


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Samuel Change - Discretionary Review Requestor


- He lives next door to the subject property.


- He is concerned with the negative impact the project will have on the light and air coming to his house.


- All he is asking for is a further setback on the second story addition.


- The rear yard is unstable so there is a need for the project sponsor to do some landscaping and create a wall so that the soil does not go onto his property.


- He gets along with the project sponsor but what he is asking for is minimal.


(+) Nelson Chiu - project architect


- The problem with this project is that a designer starts building something that somebody probably does not like for whatever reason.


- His work has complied with all the Planning Department's suggestions as far as the building code and has tried to get this project going.


- The project sponsor is running out of room for he and his growing family to have decent living space.


- The options are to add on a room upstairs.  The basement right now has 7 feet, less than 7 feet head room clearance, so that makes the addition to the rear of the building without increasing the height of existing building height the best option.


- He feels that the addition will not block any light and air to the neighbor.


(+) Kid Chan


- She has two children and currently her home is very small.  She would like to expand to make more room for her family.


- With the five foot setback on the side, there would be enough light and air to her neighbor's property.


ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and approved the project with the following modifications:  1) delete ground floor, 2) issue a notice of special restriction to designate the property as a single-family dwelling; 3) the recreation and family room shall be combined.  Deck and the set back should remain as proposed.


AYES: Antonini, Hughes, S. Lee, W. Lee

E. PUBLIC COMMENT ON AGENDA ITEMS WHERE THE PUBLIC HEARING HAS BEEN CLOSED


At this time, members of the public who wish to address the Commission on agenda items that have already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the public hearing has been closed, must do so at this time.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.


Re:  301 Mission Street


Jeffrey Liebovitz


- He wants to address the issue as he did last week regarding the Rincon Hill plan and the lack of open space on mechanisms for  Recreation and Park to acquire open space.


- 301 Mission Street is another project that is going to bring 320 residential units located in the south of market.


- There is no mechanism by which they are paying into the open space fund since there is no open space fund


- There is a deficiency in the EIR when it comes to Recreation and Park, which is really the provider of open space for the entire city.  That's what he would like this Commission to do--to try to formulate a mechanism with the planning department and their staff when the time comes, that the developer agree to pay into a fund so that Recreation and Park gets augmented.


Sue Hestor


- She commented on the EIR and left her comments and responses at the office.


- She wants to talk about the insufficient response about the bridge.


- This site was adjacent to the freeway on Beale Street.  Because there was literally a death count at the intersection because of traffic accidents, the Planning Commission said it would abridge its policy and allow a pedestrian bridge.


- So there is this rather silly pedestrian bridge that takes up half of the sidewalk width.  She would like this EIR to analyze the pedestrian issues.

301 MISSION STREET
 -  south side of Mission Street, Lots 1 and 17 in Assessor's Block 3719 - Request under Planning Code Section 309 (Review of Downtown Buildings) for Determinations of Compliance and Exceptions, including:  an exception to upper-tower bulk limits (Section 272); an exception to height limits for upper-tower extensions (Section 263.9); an exception to rear yard requirements (Section 134(d)); an exception to ground level wind current requirements (Section 148); and an exception to sunlight on public sidewalks (Section 146);  The project lies within a C-3-O (Downtown Office) District and within a 550-S/400-S Height and Bulk District. The proposed project will be constructed on a site containing three existing two-to-six story commercial structures containing approximately 100,000 square feet of office space with some ground level retail uses.  The site also contains a vacant parcel that is the former site of a 126,732 square-foot office building that was red-tagged and demolished after the Loma-Prieta earthquake.  A letter of determination dated July 8, 2002 from the Zoning Administrator determined that the development site had an office space credit of 126,732 square feet because the demolition of the red-tagged office building was involuntary on the part of the property owner.  The proposal is to demolish the existing three structures and construct an approximately 900,000 gross square-foot structure consisting of a 58-story, 605-foot tall tower on the western portion of the site, containing approximately 320 residential units, approximately 120-units of extended stay hotel rooms, and ground floor retail uses; a 43-foot tall glass-enclosed central atrium; a 9-story, 125-foot tall office structure with approximately 130,000 gross square feet of office space, with ground level retail uses on the eastern portion of the site; and an underground four-level parking garage containing approximately 351 parking spaces.  


Preliminary Recommendation:  Approval with Conditions.


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Glenn Rescalvo - Project Architect


- This is a world-class residential building.


- The project will add character to the San Francisco skyline.


- The outdoor space is a combination of spaces.   There is ample space for sidewalks to allow for street furniture.


- The atrium has ample seating, landscaping and a water fountain.


- The garden terrace allows for ample seating and is accessible from the street and the atrium.


- There is retail along the first floor façade.


(+) Phillip Ahrens - Founding Partner of Millennium Partners


- The structure will respect the skyline of San Francisco.


- The project will bring 24-hour activity to the Transbay neighborhood.


- The project is compatible with the Downtown Plan.

- There will be 610 full time jobs, there will be millions of dollars to contributions, and there will be annual payments of taxes, which will generate fees to fund the Transbay renovation project.


- They are investing millions of dollars in improving the streetscape.


- There will be a transportation broker who will coordinate the transportation services to the area.


- There is one significant disagreement, which is in the area of parking.  Families with children need an independently accessible space for their cars.  They are prepared in their compromise to allow the other spaces for the other units to exist as tentative spaces.


(+) Jim Salinas - San Francisco Building and Construction Trades Council


- He read a letter from Stan Warren who is the president of the San Francisco Building and Construction Trades Council who is in full support of this project because this will open thousands of construction jobs.


(-/+) Sue Hestor


- She has issues with the circulation because the project sponsor is asking for a lot of parking spaces.


- The area is the most congested section of the area.


- The pedestrian bridge should be removed.


- She cares more about the pedestrian traffic going from north to south.


- How is this project going to be an incentive to walk?


- There should be a requirement to take down the Beale Street pedestrian bridge.


(+) Anita Hill- Executive Director of the Yerba Buena Alliance

- This is another project that will help and enhance the City.


(+) John Elberling - Executive Director of Tenants Association


- He recommends this project because this project will begin to turn the Transbay Terminal area around.


- There is extreme mediocrity in various buildings that were built in the 80s.  This project has design quality.


- Millennium Partners has always honored their word and kept their promises to the community.


(+) Don Marcos - South of Market Employment Center


- The project falls under the City's Hiring program so he is very much in support of this project.


- Millennium Partners have contributed to training programs. 


(+) Norman Rolfe


- One of his concerns about this project has been addressed with the accommodations of the Caltrain extension.


- He just hopes that that is the way it goes.


- Regarding the parking, he urges the Commission to respect the parking proposed.


- The residential parking should be raised to 1-to-4.


(+) Jeffrey Liebovitz


- This project is a great addition to his neighborhood.


- He urges the Commission to approve the parking that Millennium Partners is requesting.


- He requested Inclusionary housing as well and hopes that this will be a condition.


- The developer should pay into some kind of fund for the residential component.

Preliminary Recommendation:  Approval 


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Byron E. Rhett - Planning Director for the Port of San Francisco


- The condos on the site are a mixed-use development with general office, maritime office, etc.


- The development will generate economic benefits like union and blue-collar jobs, etc.


- This project will generate funds to sponsor the Bryant Street Warf.


- He feels that they have arrived with a win-win project.


- There will be millions of dollars invested in the pier renovation.


(+) Dan Howard - Vice President Freedman Architects


- This location is a spectacular location.


- The building will contain 136 units.


- They have incorporated below market rate units as well as market rate units.


- The building has two distinctive shoulders, these shoulders allows the glassy corners to appear light and airy.


(-) Sue Hestor


- The building has a mechanical room at the top of the building that does not look very good.


- What is missing is the perspective when one is driving across the bridge.


- She passed to the Commissioners the fundamental requirements for downtown buildings.


(+) Jim Salinas - San Francisco Buildings and Trade Council

- Putting affordable housing on this property is going to be very time consuming and would require State legislation.  The developer indicated that they could not take on the task.  The port indicated and promised that as soon as the cruise terminal project is approved and on it's way, they would take on the development of the rest of the property for affordable housing and take all the complicated steps to do this.


- He urged the Commission to approve this project today and begin the promised development of an affordable housing unit structure.


(+) Elen Jonk - Executive Director of the San Francisco Bay Planning Coalition


- This project represents two important aspects of planning.  This project is not an isolated one.  It represents a very exciting and emerging shoreline.  This is a perfect example of merging different ideas.  The regional agencies all looked at this and balanced the needs of public trust considerations.


(+) Jeffrey Leibovitz


- The developer has done an excellent job for the City.


- This is something that many people can be proud of.


- This project will pay millions of dollars to develop the Bryant Street Warf.
