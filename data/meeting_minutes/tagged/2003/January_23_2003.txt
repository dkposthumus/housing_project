296 TOWNSEND STREET, a landlocked lot between 4th, Brannan, Townsend, and Lusk Streets; Lot 163 in Assessor's Block 3787: Request for Conditional Use Authorization pursuant to Planning Code Sections 818.14 and 102.7 to allow the establishment of a dwelling unit within an SSO (Secondary Service / Office) Mixed-Use Zoning District. The proposal is to convert an existing 3-level live/work unit into a dwelling unit so that (1) the existing 3rd story could be expanded to accommodate 520 additional square feet of floor area and (2) 170 square feet of floor area could be added within the existing 2nd level . The work would include raising the overall height of the building by up to 7 feet. Planning Code Sections 233 and 181 prohibit the expansion or intensification of live/work units. A Rear Yard Modification, pursuant to Planning Code Section 134(e), is also requested as part of this project. The subject property is within an SSO Mixed-Use Zoning District and a 50-X Height and Bulk District.

296 TOWNSEND STREET, a landlocked lot between 4th, Brannan, Townsend, and Lusk Streets; Lot 163 in Assessor's Block 3787: Request for a Rear Yard Modification to allow the creation of a new dwelling unit without the required rear yard. The proposal is to convert and existing live/work unit into a dwelling unit and to perform interior and exterior alterations. Without such modification, Planning Code Sections 134(a)(1) and 134(a)(1)(C) would require that 25 percent of the total lot depth be provided at the lowest story containing a dwelling unit and at each succeeding level. As measured from 4th Street, the total depth of the subject lot is 136 feet; a 34 foot required rear yard is therefore required for the proposed dwelling unit. At all levels of the proposed dwelling, the rearmost 31 feet of the lot are occupied by a 3-story live/work unit. A rear yard is not required for live/work units. The subject property is within an SSO Mixed-Use Zoning District and a 50-X Height and Bulk District.

11.          Commission Comments/Questions
Commission Secretary:
- She has received a request from a member of the public regarding correspondence and it's availability to the public.
- Anything she receives via email, regular mail or hand delivered is available to the public.
- Anything that commissioners receive individually, outside the Commission Office, the Commission Secretary has no control over.  She requested that anything sent directly to commissioners be forwarded or copied to the Commission Secretary for inclusion in the public file.
Commissioner Antonini:
- He thought that the hearing last week went very well but wanted to clarify a couple of things:
1) Some people filled out more than one speaker card.  This caused delays and confusion.
2) People are allowed to have an interpreter.  If a person elected to use the interpreter they were given twice as much time to speak than those who did not use the interpreter.
Commissioner Hughes:
- He has a question on information he receives:  If he receives something from the public should he send a copy or the original?  (Response:  Either, as long as a copy is placed in the public file.)
Commissioner William Lee:
- He would like to commend Kate McGee who was the planner for the day labor program that came before the Commission last week.
- Regarding Commissioner Antonini's comment on the language issue.  Through Mark Leno's office, he was been working on the language accessibility ordinance which includes most departments (Police, Fire, Health Departments, etc.).  He did not witness any violation to language accessibility at last week's meeting, and he states that he would be the first person to enforce this ordinance.
Commissioner Feldstein:
- Regarding the budget, she would like to know what opportunities exist with working with other departments regarding fee work on planning/environmental services.
- She would like the department to look at the Discretionary Review process regarding time and fees.
- She would like to have the Director look at mandatory discretionary reviews for demolition and consider whether the Commission needs to look at all cases related to this.
- She would like to see ways for staff to be given more ability to determine whether Discretionary Review projects meet the exceptional and extraordinary standard.  Sometimes projects come before them that do not meet these standards.
Commissioner Boyd
- He would like to know what the procedure would be if he receives media type correspondence or presentation type.  (Commission Secretary responded that anything physical that a Commissioner receives is subject to public record and should be forwarded via copies to her.)
Commissioner Bradford Bell:
- She saw the video of last week's hearing.
- Her mother is doing fine and she would like to thank everyone for their concern.
- She would like to commend Commissioner Hughes for always being prepared and organized and for having thoughtful questions.
- She would like to have smarter and not harder meetings for this 2003 Planning Commission year.

12.          Director's Announcements
Re:  Continuance of 2690 Harrison Street
He would recommend that this case be continued to March 20, because on March 13 he has scheduled the Department's 2003/2004 budget and work program before the Commission.
Re: Eastern Neighborhoods Briefing 
- He would suggest that this briefing be scheduled on Monday, March 3, 2003 as a special hearing.  We are attempting to reserve the Board of Supervisor's Chambers for that date with a starting time around 5:00 p.m. or 6:00 p.m.
- February 20, 2003 is not a suitable hearing date for this item because he would like to have this date also reserved to complete the Commission hearing and action process on the Department's budget–as well as their hearing agenda.
- February 27, 2003 is a date that is already impacted with regular hearing items.
Re:  Antenna Guidelines
- He would recommend taking some time on February 20 to address this item.
- This would give us enough time to get a representative from the Health Department and have all the different carriers present.
Re: Grant
- The department will be a beneficiary of a grant.
- A copy of this contract has been placed in Commissioner's folders.
- If the Commission has no issues on this contract, he will move forward on it.
Re: Day Labor Project
- He passed forward the conditions that were placed on the approval of this project.  He would like to be able to release this project and move it forward.  If any commissioner has a question or concern, please let him know.

Otherwise, the item will go to committee for a hearing before being sent to the full Board of Supervisors.
Re:  New Committees
- President Gonzales has not yet finalized committees and their members. He (Jean Paul Samaha) will keep the Commission informed
- The Land Use Committee has been re-instated to hear housing and land use issues.  There will be committees on Budget, Finance, Rules and City Services.

                    GOLDEN GATE PARK CONCOURSE AUTHORITY PROJECT - Public Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Report:  The site is between the California Academy of Sciences and the M. H. de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park, called the Music Concourse area.  In 1998, voters of San Francisco approved Proposition J, Golden Gate Park Revitalization Act, to improve the landscape and pedestrian environment of the Music Concourse area.  Phase I of the proposed project would include an underground parking facility of 800 to 1,000 spaces at the Music Concourse, surface improvements, and transportation improvements in the Concourse area, and throughout Golden Gate Park, as described in Proposition J.  Proposition J requires removal of surface parking spaces from the Concourse area, and in locations throughout the Park, equivalent to the number of spaces provided in the new underground parking facility upon completion of the parking facility. In addition to the underground parking facility, the Transportation Implementation Plan includes the following elements: intra-park shuttle, cultural shuttle, traffic calming, parking management, bicycle and pedestrian improvements, road closures, and MUNI service improvements. Phase II of the project would entail construction of an Underground Through Street connecting Fulton Street to Middle Drive East, which would allow for through traffic to be restricted or eliminated from Tea Garden Drive and Academy Drive. The proposed underground roadway would ramp down at Eighth Avenue at Kennedy Drive and would extend beneath the east end of the Concourse and alongside the east side of the California Academy of Sciences, where it would ramp up to Middle Drive East.  This underground street would not provide access into the parking garage and would be intended to reduce cross-park vehicular traffic through the Music Concourse.  The project site is within the P (Public Use) zoning district and within an OS (Open Space) Height and Bulk District; Assessor's Block 1700, Lot 1. Note:  Written comments will be received at the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m., on January 28, 2003. February 5, 2003.

- He understands that the neighborhood does not oppose the garage.  The issues the neighbors have are that the traffic will be impacted and that additional traffic studies need to be done because they feel that they have not been done with sufficient detail.
(-) Michael Grandin – North Park Neighbors Association
- Traffic is a big concern to him and his fellow neighbors.
- He is concerned with the elimination of the free parking spaces.
- The garage will increase the traffic and this will impact the neighborhood.

(-) Duncan Kennedy – North Park Neighbors Association

- She would like the design of the garage be a part of the EIR.
(-) Tom Harriman – Alliance for Golden Gate Park
- He is concerned that public transportation will be stalled because of the heavy traffic this project will cause.

(-) Cris Dudedstadt
- He knows every detail of this park.
- The general garage plan will cause many negative impacts on the park and the neighborhood.
- Alternatives have been presented that address all the issues brought up, yet they were not considered.

(-) Jim Iwersen – Inner Sunset Merchants and Residents
- This is a very complicated and radical proposal for this park.
- Congestion is very much of an issue.

- She urges the Commission to allow revisions to the design.
(-) Mary Ann Miller – San Francisco Tomorrow
- She opposes the way Phase I and Phase II are described in this EIR.
- This EIR is inadequate and should be sent back for further work.
(-) Steven Chapman
- He is very disturbed with the EIR for this project.
- This project will make this park into a more  park friendly  park, which will cause traffic congestion problems.
- It is time that San Francisco concentrate on its transit-first policy.
(-) Steve Willis – Save Golden Gate Park
- This EIR is not very efficient.
- The EIR fails to consider the impact of the current expansion of the museum and Academy of Sciences.
- There are hundreds of unanswered questions that were not placed in the minutes of the Concourse Authority meetings.
(-) John Rizzo – Commissioner of the Golden Gate Park Concourse Authority
- He believes that the no vehicle alternative could be  flushed out  from the EIR.
- The mitigation section does deal a lot with the north side of the park.  Some language on the south part of the park could be added.
(+) Peter Winkelstein - SPUR
- He recommends that the Commission approve this EIR.
(+) Jill Wynns – Board of Education
- This garage was the key to bringing a compromise to renovate the park.
- She believes that the garage should be built as soon as possible so that the renovation of the other parts of the park can move forward.
(-) Joshua Hart – San Francisco Bicycle Coalition
- They are opposed to this garage but are in support for improvements to the park and public transportation to the park as well.
- This EIR is a flawed document.
- There has been no consideration to the safety of pedestrians and bicycle traffic.
(-) Katherine Roberts
- She is opposed to the garage.
- Prop J did not mandate a garage it authorized a garage.
- The opening statement in this EIR is misleading and needs to be changed.
(-) Sandy Linder
- She has been a long-time volunteer and docent at the Academy of Sciences for over 25 years.
- She has some concerns about the negative effects to the institutions in the park.
- She agrees with the pedestrian commodities yet there is a need for more services for children and handicap people.
- She hopes the Commission looks carefully at a through road--either underground or above ground--because it could affect the integrity of the park.
(+) Roberta Borgonovo
- She supports Phase I of this project and to make the concourse safe and accessible.
- She does not have an objection to the underground component.
- She hopes Phase II will be examined more fully.
(-) Ronald Konopaski – Richmond District Neighbors
- There is misinformation throughout the EIR.
- He submitted a counter proposal that he would like the Commission to consider.
(-) John Laskin
- He opposes the renovation of the park as well as the garage.
(-) Martha Kropt – California Academy of Sciences
- The committee of the academy will submit a formal response to the Concourse Authority.

(+) Tish Brown – Fine Arts Museums
- She read a letter from someone who supports the EIR but could not attend the meeting because of a disability.
(+) Carolyn McMillan – Fine Arts Museums
- She supports the EIR and feels that the Planning Department has done an adequate job dealing with all the issues presented.
- This project will allow access to the disabled public.
