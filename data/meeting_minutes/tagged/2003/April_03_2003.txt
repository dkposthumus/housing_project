O'SHAUGHNESSY DAM DISCHARGE MODIFICATION PROJECT
 - O'Shaughnessy Dam is located at Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, in Yosemite National Park (Tuolumne County).  
Appeal of a Preliminary Negative Declaration
.  The area is accessed by Camp Mather Road off Highway 120.    The project consists of modifying the piping at O'Shaughnessy Dam that controls discharge to the existing 108-inch Canyon Power Tunnel pipeline (or penstock) at the base of the dam, and the downstream water transmission system. The piping modification involves construction of a new 60-inch pipeline to allow withdrawal of water from a higher level in the reservoir, to be used when turbidity in the reservoir is above the allowable level.  The project also involves demolition of the lower valve house.  The purpose of the project is to improve the water quality and water supply from Hetch Hetchy Reservoir to the City and Country of San Francisco and its water customers by constructing a second higher outlet to the aqueduct from the reservoir

10.  Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner Antonini:


Re:  Housing Element


- Part of the housing element deals with public housing.


- He read over the housing element but he is not sure if there is enough information on whether there is a Federal or State requirement on how much public housing should be built in relation to per capita or whether or not Section 8 type housing could be used as a substitute.  It is important to know if this particular type of housing fits into the scheme of things.  


- The Commission will be making decisions based on inclusionary housing, based on affordable housing, based on for-profit housing, etc.  The Commission needs a bit more knowledge or background on the issue of public housing to properly make decisions on other housing questions.  He would like input from staff before the Housing Element is considered.


Commissioner William Lee


Re:  Budget Update


- He would like the status on the budget.


- He would also like to know if there will be any lay-offs of staff.


Commissioner Feldstein:


Re:  Family Housing


- She would like to see staff start incorporating this policy in projects before they come to the Commission so that developers will not feel they are being blindsided.


Commissioner Boyd:


Re:  Housing Components


- He would like information on statistics that are available on the number of units that are being built in the City and how many of these are affordable and how many are market rate.


- What is the impact on rental housing?


C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
11. Director's Announcements


Regarding Commissioner William Lee's comment:


- He is still in discussion with the Mayor's office regarding the budget so there is nothing to report.


- Regarding layoffs:  The Planning Department does not plan to have any terminations, layoffs, etc. through the next fiscal year.  Additional instructions from the Mayor's office are being met without any layoffs.  If the Department had to employ some new program, he would come before the Commission first to receive input.


Regarding Commissioner Feldstein's comment:


- The requests from Commissioner Feldstein regarding car shares, family housing, etc.:  The Commission has the authority to change a project as they see fit.


- It is the responsibility of staff to let developers, lawyers, public, etc. be aware of Commissioner's concerns.


- The process to deal with these issues is developing.  It is not something that will happen overnight but the process is definitely moving forward.

12. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals


BOS 


Jean Paul Samaha gave the following report:


Re:  1193 Oak Street


- The Board overturned the Planning Commission on a +10-1 vote, with Supervisor Hall dissenting.  The Board felt that it was a loss of housing even though the tenant remained in the dwelling unit, and that it was a bad precedent to set.


The following items passed unanimously on the first reading:


1)  Rezoning of King and Townsend Streets (601 King Street)


2) Designation of the Dogpatch Historic District


3) Third Street Alcohol Restricted Use District


On April 7, the Land Use Committee will hear 2161 Sutter Street - Zoning Map Change.

Re:  Continuance


Robert Wales


- This case has been continued much too many times.


- He would like to have this case heard today.


Barbara Janeff


- She does not understand what information is needed.


- She is not really happy about the delay.


Kenneth Thompson


- He owns property that is very close to where the antennas will be installed.


- He would like to have this matter settled today.


Jennifer Donnely


- She will be providing staff with the information requested.


Re:  Merits of the Case


(-) Robert Wales


- He lives on Beach Street.


- He is less than 100 feet from these proposed antennas.


- He is concerned about the radiation, reduction of property values, etc.


- He contacted Verizon Wireless about the noise that will be heard during the installation and they were not very helpful.


- He can think of various locations where these antennas can be placed where they are not close to people's homes and people's bedrooms.


(-) Erika Tarantino


- He is aware of various neighbors who were not able to come and who are against these antennas.


- The building in question is already a very bulky building.  These antennas will be unsightly and not aesthetically pleasing.


- Verizon told the neighbors that the fans, which will be installed, would not make any more noise than regular traffic.


- No one can guarantee her and her neighbors that there will not be any health affects.


(-) Barbara Janeff


- The problem she has with these antennas and this proposal is that when one is installed, it will be cause for other carriers to come and install their antennas, creating an antenna farm.


- This will cause a disruption in people's lives.


(-) Kenneth Thompson


- He lives on the top floor of the proposed building.


- It is outrageous that something like this would be proposed in a residential neighborhood.


- He is concerned with the health hazards.


(-) Madeline Camisa - Committee for Antenna-Free Marina


- She is opposed to this installation.


- The carrier already has two cell sites in the Marina.


- These sites should provide more than adequate coverage to the area.


- According to a survey, 90% of cell phone users were very satisfied; of these 18% were Verizon users.


- Please reject this proposal.

There has not been adequate notice of this project.


(-) Rose Wang


- Her neighbors have opposed any antennas in the area.


- She would like to have the Commission disapprove this application because there have been many changes to the project and this causes confusion to the neighbors.  Service from Cingular is very satisfactory.
