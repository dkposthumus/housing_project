1. 1999.233E (W. WYCKO: (415) 558-5972)


833 - 881 JAMESTOWN AVENUE
 - 
Appeal of Preliminary Negative Declaration. 
 The project sponsor proposes construction of a Planned Unit Development (PUD) that would consist of 198 one-, two- and three-bedroom market-rate condominiums on an approximately 6.9-acre lot, located at 833-881 Jamestown Avenue on Assessor's Block 4991, Lot 277, on the northern slope of  Bayview Hill.  The site is currently used as an overflow parking lot for events at Candlestick Park, which is approximately one-third of a mile southeast of the project site.  The site is bordered by Jamestown Avenue (and single-family homes on the north side of Jamestown) to the north, another vacant lot to the east that also is used for parking for major events at Candlestick Park, the hillside to the south, and single-family housing to the west.  Although the area proposed for development is mostly flat, development would require excavation of up to approximately 30 vertical feet at the base of the hill.  The project would consist of 11 separate three- and four-story buildings:  seven buildings of 12 to 18 units each along Jamestown Avenue and four buildings to the rear, at the base of the hillside.  Of these latter four structures, two (36 units each) would be built atop one-story gated parking garages, while smaller buildings (one of eight and one of 10 units) would flank the garages.  A total of 216 independently accessible parking spaces would be provided.  The proposed project would include landscaping along Jamestown Avenue, construction of a 10-foot-wide sidewalk, two off-street freight loading areas, and about 28,900 sq. ft. of common open space, including two rear yards at the base of the hillside totaling about 7,250 sq. ft. and podium- and ground-level patios.  The project also would remedy an existing drainage problem on Bayview Hill above the project site, on Recreation and Park Department land.  The project site is located within the South Bayshore Plan area, in an RH-2 (Two-Family) Use District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.  As a PUD, the project would require review and approval by the City Planning Commission pursuant to Sections 303 and 304 of the Planning Code.

SPEAKER(S):


Re:  Continuance


Christopher Moscone


- He requested that this matter be moved because there are only four Commissioners today.


- He represents the Discretionary Review requestor.


- This case is not a simple matter.


John Glugoski


- He lives across the street from the property and he seconds the request to have this case moved.


Jay Cappella


- He does not want to be postponed.  The hearing date for this case has been postponed many times.  During that time, there have been a lot of discussions and many issues have been resolved.


- His wife is expecting a baby and delaying the project would impact his family life quite negatively.


Re:  Merits of Project


(-) Christopher Moscone - Representing Discretionary Review Requestor


- This project has changed many times from the beginning.


- The variance is asking to further increase and encroach the non-compliance aspect of the project.


- There is no need to have a variance.  He believes that the project sponsor could build without a variance.


- Developing a simple roof garden would be a solution.


- It is the responsibility of the Acting Zoning Administrator to allow the smallest variance allowable.


(-) Bruce Bonacker - Project Architect


- He displayed a map of the assessor's block in order to show the mid-block open space and demonstrate that the DR requestor does not have the benefit of a mid-block open space.


- The DR requestor's rear yard is quite important with regards of privacy and sun.


- He displayed a photograph of the DR requestor's view to their yard.


- The rear windows on the DR requestor's back yard that are very close to the project sponsor's rear windows, so there are issues with privacy.


(-) Melissa Conroy Whitney


- She and her family live on Jones Street adjacent to the proposed project on Vallejo Street.


- They have been trying to make a home for themselves, but this project will cause a real significant cost to her family.


- The project sponsors have not contacted them regarding this issue.


- They are concerned about the privacy impact of this project and request that fixed and obscure glass be installed on any windows on the second, third or fourth floor rear addition.


- Their bedroom windows are less than 10 feet from the proposed kitchen addition.  Their child's bedroom is in line of site of all three levels of construction.


- She opposes the fourth floor level because of the light impact it will have.


(-) John Glugoski


- He lives on Vallejo Street.


- He submitted a letter regarding the reasons for his opposition to this project.


- He understands that the project has changed, and that this information only went out 24 hours ago.  This is not enough time for everyone to look through the new plans.


- If the project goes through, it will create a tremendous invasion of privacy.


(-) Catherine Ferrera


- This project is a huge concern to her and her sister.


- There has been misleading information given to them.


- The project will encroach on their privacy.  It will increase the noise and impact their garden.


- They have tried to negotiate but have not been met with a compromise.


(+) Jennifer Cherk - Project Sponsor


- She displayed a lot plan of her property.


- She has a very modest sized lot.  It is actually the smallest on the entire block.


- Her property is not directly facing the DR requestor's property.


- The south facing window has a distance of 18 feet from the DR requestor.


- She has been trying very hard to solve privacy issues.  They have proposed obscured glass and setbacks.


- She has been in this house for 15 years, first as a renter then as a property owner [as a tenancy in common].  She is the third generation to live on this property.


(+) Susan (Bo) Lee - Co-Owner


- They have very small units.


- She is the owner of the second floor.


- She does not have very much space to expand.


- She has asked the DR requestor to prove what harm there would be if there was no obscure glass.


- She mitigated the sound of the DR requestors back yard living area by installing double pane glass.


- She does not have a back yard.


(+) Jon Ridenour


- There is a neighbor who is complaining about loosing privacy yet the project is actually building in a privacy factor.


- He feels that this DR is more about keeping the project sponsor from seeing into the DR requestor's garden than it is about any issues that are going to involve their life to an extraordinary circumstance.


(+) George Hauser - Architect


- He can assure the Commission that there has been plenty of interaction on this project.


- He does not think that there were any issues with the second floor expansion in regards to the variance.


- There was an issue with the obscure glass because it is unnecessary to restrict a project in this way.


- The project architect has done a great job in designing this project to be aesthetically pleasing to the neighborhood.


(+) Dart Cherk - Project Architect


- He requested that the Commission approve this project.


- He grew up in this house.  He is the father of the co-owner.


- He was trained to always consider all things.


- This project does not impact the neighbors.


(+) Jay Capela


- He has really made an effort to reach out to the neighbors.  


- He wants to move the project forward.


- He disagrees with the recommendation made by the planner that there was no need for a bathroom on the fourth floor.  His family is growing and he feels that there is a need for the bathroom.

(did not state name)


- He believes that this case should be continued longer.

RESIDENTIAL DEMOLITION POLICY
 - A proposal to modify and refine interim criteria to implement a Temporary Residential Demolition Policy requiring mandatory Discretionary Review of all dwelling unit demolitions not requiring Conditional Use authorization, with certain exceptions; to adopt a specific Soundness Determination process; and to adopt criteria for conformity with applicable General Plan policies and objectives; and a recommendation to apply this policy for an approximate six-month period, after which a long-term policy would be presented for consideration and adoption by the Commission.


Preliminary recommendation: Adopt the Temporary Residential Demolition Policy.


NOTE: On November 6, 2003, following public testimony, the Commission kept the Public Hearing open and continued to this item to December 11, 2003. 


SPEAKER(S):


Cris Durazo - South of Market Community Action Network


- She urged the Commission to vote in favor of this when there is a full Commission.


- Exhibit 3 doesn't put a measurement on how there are no out-of-compliance votes.  When does a project not get approved?


- This would be a concern of hers.


- She likes the fact that the Planning Department is making this more systematic.


- She is glad that this is also becoming more scientific.


- In Recommendation 14, which talks about rental protection, it does say that the Commission will look at the loss of rental stock.  She is concerned that the proposed housing is not being 1:1.  It is important to look at affordability.


- Housing stock should include affordability.


Jeremy Paul


- He has been before the Commission on may demolition cases.


- Staff has done a very good job on this.


- He is in support of a guideline but is very reluctant to support anything that will limit the discretion of this Commission.


- This discretion should be respected.


- People should keep clearly in mind what they want to protect.


- This will encourage a lack of maintenance, a lack of sound stewardship of properties.


- The project sponsor should be clear about what they want to do with a project.


Patrick Buscovich


- Guidelines are very important.  He has seen reports and sometimes he does not even know what is being discussed.


- Discretion is important for the Commission.


- The $200 value is ok with him.


- It is important to not look at this analysis by quantity.  It is important to look at them in a quality manner.


- It is important that planners do site visits.


- Long term viability is very important as well.


Hiroshi Fukuda - Richmond Community Association


- Staff mentioned that there were not [many] comments on this policy, yet not that many people know about it.


- One of the more important aspects of this policy is cost.


- This item needs to be continued.


Maria Sousa - Board of Directors of the Planning Association of the Richmond District


- They only became aware that this was on the agenda this week.


- They were able to get the case report on Tuesday so their comments are not as complete as they would like.


- They would like to commend staff on a clear and earnest effort in developing the written criteria.


- Demolitions have been historically controversial.  In their district, there have been more than 35 in the last 12 months.


- Recommendation No. 6 - they feel that there is little consideration on how a building that will be demolished will affect the policy that existing housing needs to be preserved and protected.


- There is nothing that prohibits the author [of the soundness report] from being involved in another project with the project sponsor.


- Staff does not have enough expertise on demolition reports.


- There should be a higher threshold than the 50 percent.


Judith Berkowitz - EMIA, CSFN


- There is pending revisions to the Residential Design Guidelines as well as Discretionary Review Proposals.


- There is no consideration of these proposals with the demolition policy.


- In the discussion under rental protection, there is no reference to the fact that many of the demolitions that are being approved are previously owner-occupied homes.  The replacement buildings are multi housing units.


- Greater weight should be placed on preserving housing and neighborhood character.


- They question staff on wanting to adopt a demolition policy on criteria based on new policy demolition of family housing in recommendation 17.


- She appreciates the fact that there will be no action taken this evening.


Beatrice Franklin


- She is a resident of Trinity Plaza.


- Trinity Plaza is proposed for demolition.


- The plaza has a variety of people like, families, single people, etc.


- She is looking for all the support they can receive.


Terry Milne


- He is unclear about this proposed policy.


- Will the structure of this policy reduce the number of Discretionary Reviews?


- Does staff have any numbers on how this policy will reduce the workload for Commissioners?


Joseph Bradford


- He lives on Potrero Hill.


- He just submitted an application at the Planning Department and was not told of this hearing.


- He recommends that people at the counter be more educated on everything that is going on.


- More information should be placed on the website as well.


- He asked that the Commission as well as staff look at the per square foot value as another way of evaluating a house.


Sue Hestor


- She submitted a list of the last demolitions approved by the Commission by Districts.


- Staff has done a very admirable job on getting this out to the community.


- It is a good idea to keep this in the context of the major exterior alteration legislation as well as the residential design guidelines.


- She disagrees that a cottage only has the value of a "tear downer".


- Because of the lack of clarity of the policy, everything is considered a "tear downer."


- It is important that staff do site visits.
