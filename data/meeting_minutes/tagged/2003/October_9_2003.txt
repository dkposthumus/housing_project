2.  Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner Bill Lee


Re:  Department of Building Inspection


- There is an overlap between the Planning Department and the Department of Building Inspection regarding the notification process (311 and 312).  He is looking for a way that both departments can work together so that there is more of a transparency and smooth transition with approvals from both departments.


- He requested a joint hearing between the DBI and Planning Commissions.


Commissioner Bradford Bell:


- She agrees with Commissioner Bill Lee and would like to have a joint hearing our commission and the DBI Commission.


- She also suggested that we have a joint hearing with the Arts Commission.  The Arts component of the General Plan has not been updated in many, many years.


Commissioner Antonini:


- 


He suggested having a joint hearing with the Board of Supervisors and/or Land Use Committee to expedite the process (land use applications) and eliminate as much duplication as possible.


C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT

3. Director's Announcements


Re:  November 6, 2003:


- There will be a discussion of the demolition policy under Discretionary Reviews.


Re:  Commissioner Bill Lee's comment on noticing under DBI:


- This is an item that will continue to be discussed because it is quite important for both departments.


Re:  Requests to Staff that Result in Work Assignments from the Planning Commission:


- If the Commission has any requests for work they would like done by Department staff, or have questions that would constitute a staff work assignment, it is important that you make those types of requests or ask those questions of the Director or Acting Director.  [Mr. Badiner read part of Charter Section 4.102 relative to powers and duties of Boards and Commissions.]  It makes it easier for us [the Director or Acting Director] to understand your concerns and monitor staff work.  It also avoids multiple direction and confusion for staff.


- As always, if a commissioner has a need for clarification on any particular project that is scheduled to come before them, they are welcome to contact the appropriate staff person.

BOS - None


BOA - 


Re: 32 Rivali Street

Re:  701 Lombard Street


- A Zoning Administrator (ZA) determination was issued regarding the height.


- The Commission did not take Discretionary Review.  The appeal was on the ZA's letter of determination on the height.  The BOA upheld the ZA determination +5-0.

5.  (J. IONIN: (415) 558-6309)


DISCRETIONARY REVIEW POLICY
 - Initiation of Intent to allow administrative review of some Discretionary Review cases, and to establish criteria for administrative discretionary review through amendment of Planning Code Sections 311 and 312.


Preliminary Recommendation: Adoption


(Continued from Regular Meeting of September 11, 2003)


SPEAKER(S):


(+/-) Terry Milne - Bernal Heights Design Review Board


- His committee agrees with the pre-application idea.


- His design review board acts in a similar way.


- Regarding the entire proposal, the board agrees that there is a need to have a Planning Commission meeting to deal with various types of Discretionary Reviews.


- Although it seems that the words light and air have become "buzz" words, they should be considered with more significance.  The General Plan and the Planning Code call for mid-block open space.  He believes that every little bit of back yard is precious.


- In the proposal there is no differentiation between residential characters.


(+/) Katy Gough - Bernal Heights Neighborhood


- She has read the agendas and she noticed that there have been 193 DRs since November of 2002 and were not included in the Department's proposal.  The Commission has decided on 126 cases, of these, 48 were mandatory - either demolition or mergers.  Of those, all were automatically approved.  The other cases included 34 percent that were denied or plans were modified either by the staff or by the Commission.  Another 8 percent of the cases were withdrawn, some by the staff.


- The commission should deal with the problem of crowded agendas and overworked Planning staff by focusing on its policy of mandatory review instead of stripping the 10 percent of the cases that neighbors believe are significant to their quality of life.


(+/-) John Carney


- He believes that the Commission is doing a tremendous job even though he does not agree with everything they have approved or disapproved.


- He believes that time limits should be incorporated into this proposal.


- The right of appeal should be incorporated as well.


(+) Jeremy Paul


- There has always been an effort to reform Discretionary Review procedures.  A lot of progress has been done with the current Commission and he encourages the Commission to continue doing a great job.


(+/-) Paul Wermer


- He emphasized the benefits and the need for the pre-application process that is being proposed.


- Communication with neighbors is marginal, at best.


- The pre-application process is great but it should be expanded to all noticed neighbors.  This will be significant in reducing Discretionary Reviews.


(+/) Marilou Lascari - Neighborhood Network


- She appreciates the time staff, Jonas Ionin, has been spending with many of her neighbors.


- The Network enthusiastically supports the pre-application process.  This single step would significantly reduce the number of Discretionary Reviews brought before the Commission.


- She proposes a six-month trial of the pre-application process.


- If the pre-application process is as successful as she believes it will be, it will tremendously reduce the amount of time and work that staff needs to be involved.


(+/) Ron Miguel - PAR


- As soon as the process is initiated, he will return to speak in more detail.


- He recommends that the Commission proceed with the agenda item.


(+/) Daniela Kirshenbaum


- Communication is the key to ease the Discretionary Review process.


- She would like to continue working with Jonas Ionin and speak on things that need to be dealt with.


(+) Kate White - Housing Coalition


- She supports that the Commission move forward on this.


- Discretionary Reviews take a lot of the Commission's time.


- The Coalition believes that it makes a lot of sense to move Discretionary Reviews to a more administrative level.


- There needs to be an opportunity to deal with appeals as well.


(+/-) Donna Salazar - Community Boards


- She supports the pre-application process.


- A trial period of this would be a very good idea.


- Community Boards are more than happy to help the Commission with the process in any way.


(+/) Dick Millet


- He thinks that the Commission is trying to close the door on the public.


- When 311 notices go out, it is important that these notices are legible.


- Some of the planners are not responsive to the requests of the public.


- The planners always say that the Discretionary Review requestor and Project Sponsors should deal with their differences without a middleman to help them through any questions.


(-) Marilyn Amini


- She did not obtain the proposal until last Wednesday so there was not enough time for the public to respond in writing and allow the Commission time to review this.


- She hopes that there will not be administrative review of Discretionary Reviews.


- If there were a successful pre-application process in the San Mateo County area then it would be good to adopt it.  But there are still cases that cannot be solved at that level.


- Establishing clear criteria communicated before the Discretionary Review process would be a good idea.


ACTION: Approved Initiation


AYES: Antonini, Bradford Bell, Boyd, Feldstein, Hughes, S. Lee, W. Lee


MOTION: 16675

6. 2000.465M                                    (T. OJEDA: (415) 558-6251)


HOUSING ELEMENT OF THE GENERAL PLAN
 - The fourth public hearing on the City's Housing Element of the General Plan is scheduled before the Planning Commission on October 9, 2003.  The Planning Department will summarize Planning Commission and other public comments, offer staff response to these comments, and provide the Commission information on next steps towards the adoption of the Housing Element.


Preliminary Recommendation: Direct Staff to Commence Environmental Review.


(First Public hearing held on May 1, 2003, continued to second public hearing held on June 5, 2003 and third public hearing on July 21, 2003.)


SPEAKER(S):


Jeremy Paul


- He spoke on the breakdown between policy and practice.


- This is a core environmental issue.


- There are neighborhoods that are fighting any type of density.


- Many people are moving away from San Francisco.  The housing responsibility needs to be taken very seriously.


- Housing needs to be created.  This document takes a great deal of thought and it should be passed.


Paul Wermer


- This is not a zoning document but a template on what zoning will be based on.


- This document tries to address a lot of issues, but he is concerned that the document is extremely vague and has contradictions.


- There are assumptions of a land use element that is not written.


- One of the great things about this city is its neighborhoods, and this document does not state anything about neighborhood character.


Maria Souza - PAR - Richmond District


- She thanked everyone for contributing all the comments on this document.


- The September 18 draft is not very different than the February 2002 draft.


- She is not opposed to the policies on affordable housing.


- Policies are not needed to advance market rate housing.  Policies are needed to advance affordable housing.


Kate White - Housing Action Coalition


- She urges the Commission to direct the Planning staff to start environmental review.


- San Francisco can house low-income to moderate income as well as people from different countries.


- There has been a lot of phobia and hysteria about this housing element.


- This document is the housing element and not the parking element.


- San Francisco is a transit first city and housing for people should come before cars.


Charlotte Maeck - Pacific Heights


- She understands that this document is a policy.  It will not become a rule.


- San Francisco needs a policy and a practice.


- She thanked Commissioner Antonini for raising questions on this issue.


Barbara Austin - Francisco Heights


- The housing element is an ill-defined document.


- There are many questions and comments that have not been included in this document.


Joan Mettler - Glen Park


- She urges the Commission not to approve the policies of the Housing Element that would allow secondary units to be built, especially in single family housing, without the requirement of one parking space per one housing unit.  Nor to allow new housing to be built near transit streets without the one garage space requirement for one housing unit.


Bob Bardell - Golden Gate Valley Neighborhood Association


- He opposes those changes to the housing element that negatively impacts neighborhoods and neighborhood character.


- He urges the Commission to retain the present language on secondary units.


Peter O'Hara - Cow Hollow


- The statistical data in the housing element is dated and does not reflect the current information related to San Francisco.


- Without a valid data base it is reckless to allow this document to pass.


- It is far better to forego state and federal funding than pass something that will not lead to good housing.


- Even if the funding is received, the City is stuck with bad housing.


- The right type of housing is necessary for San Francisco.


Jeff Hagan - President of Francisco Heights Neighborhood Association


- There are many, many people that are leaving San Francisco.


- Little or no notice or outreach has been done.


- For the sake of funding, this document is being rushed.  This is not adequate because of the many people it will affect.


Rich Worner - Jordan Park


- He submitted more than 100 letters of residents of San Francisco who oppose this document.


- The Planning Code was finally changed in 1972.


- Neighborhoods need to maintain their character and parking should not be changed.


Libby Benedict - Vice President of the Francisco Heights Neighborhood Association


- San Francisco was built on a human scale.  It is not a big city but it is a big town.


- She appreciates the work that the Commission does, but the lay person is trying to understand that this is not a one size fits all city.


Judy Berkowitz - East Mission Improvement Association


- The various drafts of the housing element are not very different.


- There are 8 ½ pages of deficiencies.


- This document also contains out-of-date data.


- The four policies:  1.1,1.8,2.6 and 11.7 should be looked at closely.


- To include notices in the water bill as suggested by Commissioner Sue Lee was a good idea but to her knowledge it has not been done.


Greg Hylton - Jordan Park


- The housing element is troubling and [he] is adamantly opposed to it.


- This is just an attempt by big developers to take over without voter's approval.


- This document will cause catastrophic parking problems and will diminish the beauty of San Francisco.


- The idea that the housing element is a solution to the affordable housing problem is cruel.


- The housing element is illegal in various aspects.


- There are various organizations that were not included in this document.


Sara Lee Keropian - Francisco Heights Neighborhood Association

- If the housing element passes as written it will become the target of large developers.

- Off street parking should be maintained for many projects.


- He urged the Commission to look closely at everything that everyone has mentioned.


Mary Beth Starzell - Richmond District


- People were not invited to give their comments long ago.


- Now this document is two years late and who is responsible for this? - The Planning Department and its personnel.


- People need to have faith in government.


- Single-family homes are being demolished and in its place are four story buildings that are being built.


- The Commission should lead the way to ask planning staff to be respectful to the public.


Bob Starzell - Richmond District


- There is more theory in transit than there is reality.


- People plan and hope but the dreams are very difficult to achieve.


- MUNI is very successful.


- If staff is going to put in place a new housing element, it should require that MUNI would upgrade the transportation system.


James 0'Hara - Jordan Park


- This is a unique and special place that has neighborhoods that enable people to live in a very successful way.


- He is opposed to the housing element.


- He urges the Commission to retain the present policy on secondary units.


- Section 207.2 language should be retained.


Grover Wald - Jordan Park


- The plan presented is more a nightmare than a dream.

David Natcher

- He encourages the Commission to take the time to get additional input and see the long-term results of this document.


Marilou Lascari - Save Our Neighborhoods


- There has been a lot of explanation on this but since when does one approve policy that the public does not want to be enacted.


- The ill-advised policies should be eliminated.


- Policies 1.1, 1.8, 2.6 and 11.7 should be eliminated.


Ron Lichty - Sunset District


- This is very bad policy based on false premises.


- This housing element sets the tone of the future.


- This document is not rezoning.


- Everyone in San Francisco should know about this and the concept that the Planning Department has notified everyone is nonsense.


- In-laws are illegal.


Mark Fighera - Francisco Heights


- When he hears everything that is being proposed, it scares him.

Penelope Clark - Russian Hill Neighborhood Association


- The policies being considered do not have any policies for affordable housing or housing for large families.

- Because of Proposition M, many units would have to be built.


Joy Small - Jordan Park 


- There is a revolt amongst the neighborhood associations against actions being taken to eliminate them and change them.


Bette Spencer - Richmond District


- Her neighborhood would be affected by an 80-foot height limit.


- Does the Commission want to be friendly to families or friendly to developers?


Francisco Centurion - Russian Hill Neighbors/Architect


- He completed Penelope Clark's testimony:


- The result of implementing these flawed policies is that neighborhoods will have a decreased quality of life and there will be less family housing and more suburban housing.  This is not smart growth.  This is greed driven stupid growth.


Kelly Whatts


- These policies are not standard development policies.


- He is pleased to see so many people come out.


- He had not heard of any outreach from the Planning Department.


- He would like to see a little more outreach.

Dan Liberthson - Miraloma Improvement Club


- Many people have expressed their opposition to this draft document in its current form.


- The Miraloma Improvement Club opposes this document in it's current form.

John Lowry


- He is not in support of the bulk, density and height limitations in this document.


- This document is a very far-reaching plan.

Francisco De Costa - SON


- He thanked the constituents of this city for coming here today and expressing their concerns.


- Today the discussion is on the housing element, transit corridors and a life that has been destroyed by concrete jungles.


- It is time that calibration is done on city planners.  There is no accountability or no transparency.


Sheila Mahoney - SON


- She is disappointed about the attempt to fix San Francisco.

- There is a lack of supply of housing.


- The greatest change in neighborhood character is an increase in the cost of housing.


David Bisho - West of Twin Peaks Association


- The association is opposed to this document for the following reasons:  lack of proper notification and public input; no meeting or workshops in any western neighborhood for the purpose of public participation and development of the final draft; the final draft promoting new housing conflicts with Prop M; the final draft promotes new market rate housing at the expense of family housing; and the final draft's policies are based on old and outdated data.


Calvin Gladney - Bridge Housing Coalition

He supports moving forward with the housing element because it encourages higher density in the City.


- Increasing density would bring more affordable housing to the City.


- There are many parts of the housing element that will bring clean affordable housing to the City.


Peter Nichol - Bridge Housing Corporation

- San Francisco is one of the most dense cities in the country and this allows for a rich cultural and economic activity for the City.

- City planning has to be driven by the most meticulous type of analysis.


- This document fails to do many things.


- This document cries out for an environmental document.


Bud Wilson - West of Twin Peaks


- The non-profit people are being misinformed if they believe that the housing element provides affordable housing.


- The vast majority of the residential homeowners are not aware of this hearing.  If everyone knew about this, this meeting would have to be moved to Davies Symphony Hall.

Norman Rolfe


- Housing for people is more important than housing for machines.

- This document will undo a lot of evils.


- He was not informed of this until just today and has not really looked at the document.


Judy Duffy


- This issue is mostly about saving the character of neighborhoods.


- The neighborhoods are very unique and contribute to tourism.


- The uniqueness of the neighborhoods is why many people decide to stay in the City.


- The legislation of Supervisor Peskin will crowd neighborhoods.


- It is important to talk to the neighborhoods and find out what they are looking for.


Barbara Meskunas - CSFN


- There are a lot of people who were brought here under false pretenses.


- This element proposes many things that are a misconception.


Pauline Peele - Bay View District


- Reducing parking areas that are close to neighborhood services is a good idea, but there are neighborhoods that do not have neighborhood services.


- Allowing higher density does not discourage existing housing.


Dick Millet


- He finished the testimony of Ms. Eileen Bokan who was not able to finish:


- The department has not consistently reached out to neighborhood associations or incorporated community input.


- ABAG has drafted a housing element revision work plan.  This plan states that community participation consists of ongoing community involvement and activities.


- Outreach to community organizations has only been a small part of the housing element revision process.


- Practice speaks louder than words.  


- What he sees is that there have been 400-foot towers on the waterfront recently approved.  This is very high density.

- This document would impact the ability of families to live in the area.

- Transit first does not mean transit only.


- Transit needs to be looked at closely before this document is passed.


- She implores the Commission to address the issue of the housing element.


Richard Schaefer


- When policies are being considered, many things are not presented as they are.


- Since the Commission is a city agency, they should consider not allowing a city on top of high-rises.


Serena Bardell


- She has lived here for 50 years.


- There is a conflict between the Planning Department and the people who live here.


- If the housing element is passed, it will not take long to see the extinction of a beautiful city.


- There will never be enough space for every soul to live here.


Beatrice Laws


- The residents of this city want to be heard.


- The outreach to the residents regarding this issue has not happened.


- More affordable housing is necessary but it should not be done at the expense of eliminating the character of neighborhoods.


Cris Durazo - SOMCAN


- The housing element is supposed to ensure affordable housing for San Franciscans.


- SOMA has absorbed all the affordable housing that has been built.


- Adequate housing is needed in SOMA.


- Demolition of sound housing is a real problem.


Dorcas Maureen Bender - Merced Manor/Preserve Our Neighborhoods


- She submitted petitions of residents who are opposed to this document.


- Neighborhood character should be preserved.

Sue Hestor


- The supply of good will toward the Planning Commission is bone dry.

- People in the eastern part of the City are desperate about affordable housing.


- The Commission is abandoning both the east and west parts of the City.


Ada Chan - MAC


- Eight out of 72 policies are new.  72 of the policies have been around in the last decade.  Has the face of the western neighborhoods completely changed?


- When people talk about protecting San Francisco, what are they talking about?


- She urges the Commission to close public comment.  The testimonies heard today have not been significantly different.


- The key concerns are out there, they have not changed.


- The Commission should close testimony, start the discussion, make the amendments necessary and adopt the housing element.


Marilyn Amini


- She has a memo dated October 2, 2003, which she had a hard time getting.  It should have been more available to the public.


- The memo states that the Commission has satisfied state code in the development of this document.


- It also states that on the 23
rd
 of January, all the public involvement had already occurred.


- There is no substantial change in the various drafts.  The public has not participated adequately.


- She believes that the Commission should not approve this document and the process should start over.


Emery Kalman


- The Planning Department is not in compliance with the Sunshine ordinance since it has violated Section Codes: 67.7a and b; and 67.7-1a.


- He was here a few months ago and asked how much this project cost and no one ever contacted him.


- The work done for this document is not well done and a waste of money and public resources.


- There have been well document testimonies.


ACTION: Following public testimony, the Commission President closed the public hearing.  No action was required of or taken by the Commission.  Acting Director, Larry Badiner, informed the Commission that the Department will modify the Draft Housing Element to include the previous Residence Element language on Secondary Units and commence environmental review and report back to the Commission on what environmental review is appropriate.  The Department will continue to take written public comment and will hold further public hearings once the environmental document is final.


G. PUBLIC COMMENT


At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes. 


The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public comment, the commission is limited to: 


(1)  responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or


(2)  requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or 


(3)  directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.  (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))


Emery Kalman


- Why isn't the City Attorney present at this meeting?


- Why does the Commission not follow the Sunshine Ordinance?


- He would like to have these questions answered in writing.


- When the Commission directs staff to answer a question from the public, why isn't if followed up.


Did not state name


- He had a question, sort of a point of order.


- Most of the public understood from the silence which followed Commissioner Antonini's comments that the procedure would be essentially as outlined by him.  The Commissioner stated that he didn't wish to be inadvertently trapped in the situation.  Will the procedure be along the lines that Commissioner Antonini suggested?


Acting Director Responded:


Yes.


John Bardis


Re: Environmental Review Process for the Housing Element


- The Environmental review process was not on the agenda today.


- In addressing the environmental review he would hope that staff would pay attention to Commissioner Boyd's comment on what is happening to payrolls that are being generated in San Francisco by the jobs that are in San Francisco.


- People are not being able to continue living here.


- He would like to have on the environmental review a very clear description of what is happening to the economy in San Francisco by not having housing for those commuters.


- He is speaking on the economic development that would be addressed in the EIR.  Staff should be very careful in exploring this issue.  The future of this city is how a strategy can be developed economically.


Marilyn Amini


Re:  Closing Public Comment


- She would like to know what are the guidelines of closing public comment on a topic that is exceedingly important and that many people have not been aware of?


- When there is a document that a of more work needs to be done?


- How can an EIR be started when no one knows how the document is going to evolve?


- What are the guidelines of closing public comment on a very significant issue and that will affect the City for decades to come?


- Does there have to be an action?


- Does only the President make the determination that public comment is closed or does other Commissioners have something to say on this?


- When public comment is closed, this is a very significant action.


Commission Secretary Responded:


- It has been the procedure for at least the last 12 years that at the end of a hearing when the President asks if there are any more speakers and no one indicates that they want to speak, the President, has the right to close the public hearing.


- I assume it was this way before I became Commission Secretary.


- Ms. Amini has been to countless hearings where this has been the procedure and it has never been questioned.


- To my knowledge, the Commission does not have to take a motion to close the public hearing.


- If this procedure has changed without my knowledge, I would appreciate someone letting me know.
