1. 2002.0277C (A. LIGHT:  (415) 558-6254)


150 GOLDEN GATE AVENUE
 - north side between Jones and Leavenworth Streets, in Assessor's Block 344, Lot 4.  Request for a Conditional Use authorization to construct a building exceeding 40 feet in height in an R (Residential) District, to determine an appropriate setback at the top portion of the front of the façade of the proposed building, and to allow an Institutional Use in an RC (Residential Commercial Combined) District.  The subject property is zoned RC-4 (Residential-Commercial, Combined, High Density) District, is in the North of Market Special Use District, and is in an 80-120-T Height and Bulk District.   The proposal is to demolish an existing four-story, approximately 88-foot high vacant building originally used as a lodge building for the Knights of Columbus, and most recently as office space.  The existing building would be replaced with a new five-story, approximately 78'-0" high building that would house administrative and some on-site service functions of the St. Anthony Foundation which provides a variety of services to homeless and other disadvantaged individuals.  The proposed facility at 150 Golden Gate would function as part of a larger campus of St. Anthony's and would specifically provide space for administrative offices, counseling, health and job training services, and, temporarily, some dining services, until a new dining and residential structure could be constructed across the street.


Preliminary Recommendation:  Approval with Conditions


(Continued from Regular Meeting of April 10, 2003)

<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


8. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals


BOS - 


Land Use Committee meeting of July 24, 2003:


- Supervisor McGoldrick held a hearing to review the Planning Department's work plan for this new 2003/2004 fiscal year. It was Supervisor McGoldrick's intention "to assist the Full Board in establishing priorities for the Department as they adopt our Budget."  Planning Staff present at the hearing included Director Green; Zoning Administrator Larry Badiner; and Amit Ghosh, Chief of Citywide Policy Planning to respond to questions about the priorities that the department has assigned to the various planning initiatives and projects currently undergoing review.    Staff was joined by President Bradford-Bell who made a strong case for a collaborative effort between the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors in setting the priorities for the Department. The hearing was continued at the call of the chair, and there was discussion about the possibility of a joint hearing between the Board's Land Use Committee and the Planning Commission about reviewing and setting the priorities for the Planning Department.


Re:  Coffee Stores and Drug stores


The committee also voted out to the Full Board for action on a unanimous vote Supervisor Gonzalez's legislation providing neighborhood noticing for new Retail Coffee Stores and drugstores in Neighborhood Commercial Districts.   This had been recommended unanimously by this Commission on June 5.


Full Board of Supervisors Meeting of July 15:


Re:  Secondary Units


The Full Board of Supervisors held a hearing on the appeal of the Department's determination that the Secondary Unit legislation is exempt from further environmental review. Single family homes are statutorily exempt from CEQA review according to a new state law.  As far as multiple unit buildings are concerned, the department found the potential impact of the legislation on that type of housing stock to be minimal, so staff issued a General Rule Exemption from environmental review for that part of the legislation.  The majority of the Board of Supervisors agreed with staff's determination and upheld the exemption on a 6-5 vote. (voting to uphold: Ammiano, Daly, Dufty, Gonzalez, Maxwell and Peskin.) Voting for the appeal: Hall, Ma, McGoldrick, Newsom and Sandoval).   The legislation will be considered by the Commission on August 21, 2003.


Re:  270 - 284 Valencia Street CU Appeal


The Board heard the appeal of the CU authorization of the 28-unit residential project at 270-284 Valencia Street. This project had been approved unanimously by this Commission and had received extensive neighborhood support.  The project sponsor, Mr. Spears had voluntarily provided all 2-bedroom units as affordable units to respond the community's desires for affordable family housing.  This was appealed by a next door neighbor to the Board with the signatures of 5 supervisors. After a failed attempt to amend the project, the Board voted unanimously to uphold your CU authorization.


Re:  Jackson Square SUD


To basically protect specialty retail and antique stores from conversion to other uses by subjecting applicants to a CU at the ground floor level. Passed unanimously by the Board.


Full Board of Supervisor's Meeting of July 22


40-50 Lansing Street
 - CU appeal of this 82-unit residential project.


3725 Buchanan Street
 - Appeal of a CU authorizing 8 panel antennas and related equipment on the roof of an existing building as part of Verizon's wireless telecommunications network. (Approved +4 -3: Antonini, Boyd, Hughes, and Sue Lee voted for and: Bell, Feldstein, and Bill Lee voted against) on May 1.


3537 19TH ST (19
th
 Street PG&E transformer).
 Appeal of the CU to authorize six antennas and backup equipment located on the building's rooftop for AT&T wireless. Appealed by neighborhood signatures.


2026 Lombard Street
 - Negative Declaration appeal on the Lombard Motel filed with the Clerk of the board on July 14, 2003.

- He has lived in the area for over 10 years.


- He is here to ask the Commission to instruct staff to keep to their word.


- Comprehensive planning for the overall area is what is most important.

- This presentation is the first time that it has been presented to the Commission and to the public.


- Public input is very important in order to find out what the residents really need and want.


Ted Chiao


- He is a resident of this neighborhood.


- The Planning Commission/Department does seem to have a plan.

- He has read articles in the newspapers stating otherwise.


- There are still details that he has concerns about: height/separation, rezoning, etc.


Terry Carlitz


- She is a homeowner in the Rincon Hill area.


- She would like to propose that until the department has had the proper input from the public, it would be wrong minded to approve any project that comes before the Commission in the near future.


- It is important to develop properly the next most desirable neighborhood.


Tim Tosta - Steffel, Levitt and Weiss


- When there is a zoning process, there is a degree of difficulty to plan it out.


- It is hard to keep the original idea and the original enthusiasm as a project or a planning process continues.


Howard Meadow - Rincon Hill Residents Association


- He has been a resident of Rincon Hill for about six years.


- He agrees with comments made by Mr. Amit Ghosh and Mr. David Alumbaugh.


- He expected development when he moved into the area.


- It is hard to see so much open space and have delays in development.


- He hopes that staff will keep to its word in the planning process of this area.


Ernestine Weiss


- She would not like "leap frog" meetings in the neighborhood.  It is important to have all the meetings involve the public.

- She encourages the Planning Commission to support staff's presentation.


- There are discrepancies between the Planning Department and the Redevelopment Agency.


- She also encouraged the Commission not to approve spot rezoning.


Bobby Carter


- It seems that there is a tunnel situation here.


- She tried to get data and could not find out what was being proposed for the area.


- It would be short sighted to move forward.


- She was amazed to see the areas of traffic, wind, light and the impact that there will be with raising the height on buildings.


- The data is somewhat incomplete and needs to be researched further.


Sue Hestor


- She did not hear any information from staff on their June 19, 2003 recommendation.


- There seems to be some contradictions from staff.

GOLDEN GATE PARK CONCOURSE AUTHORITY PROJECTS
 - 
Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR)
 - The site is between the California Academy of Sciences and the M.H. de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park, called the Music Concourse area.  In 1998, voters of San Francisco approved Proposition J, Golden Gate Park Revitalization Act, to improve the landscape and pedestrian environment of the Music Concourse area.  Phase I of the proposed project would include an underground parking facility of 800 to 1,000 spaces at the Music Concourse, surface improvements, and transportation improvements in the Concourse area, and throughout Golden Gate Park, as described in Proposition J.  Proposition J requires removal of surface parking spaces from the Concourse area, and in locations throughout the Park, equivalent to the number of spaces provided in the new underground parking facility upon completion of the parking facility. In addition to the underground parking facility, the Transportation Implementation Plan includes the following elements: intra-park shuttle, cultural shuttle, traffic calming, parking management, bicycle and pedestrian improvements, road closures, and MUNI service improvements. Phase II of the project would entail construction of an Underground Through Street connecting Fulton Street to Middle Drive East, which would allow for through traffic to be restricted or eliminated from Tea Garden Drive and Academy Drive. The proposed underground roadway would ramp down at Eighth Avenue at Kennedy Drive and would extend beneath the east end of the Concourse and alongside the east side of the California Academy of Sciences, where it would ramp up to Middle Drive East.  This underground street would not provide access into the parking garage and would be intended to reduce cross-park vehicular traffic through the Music Concourse.  The project site is within the P (Public Use) zoning district and within an OS (Open Space) Height and Bulk District; Assessor's Block 1700, Lot 1.


Since publication of the Draft EIR, the Executive Director of the Project Sponsor, Concourse Authority, notified the Planning Department that the preferred project as analyzed in the DEIR has been revised.  The project, as revised, consists of Phase I, the Underground Parking Facility, and the Transportation Improvement Measures ("TIP"), both as analyzed as part of the preferred project in the DEIR.  Phase II, the Underground Through Street, has been severed from the project and removed from further consideration.  As a consequence, the preferred project, as revised, is Phase I and the TIP elements only.  This project was identified in the DEIR as Alternative B.  With the severance of Phase II, the project, as revised, has no physical environmental impact on the historic character of the Rhododendron Dell, an area of Golden Gate Park considered individually eligible for listing on the California Register of Historical Resources.  As a result, the project, as revised, has eliminated the significant unavoidable impact to this resource that was identified in the DEIR.


Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the EIR as a Final EIR.  Please note the public review period for the DEIR ended at 5:00 pm, February 5, 2003. 
Public hearing has been closed.


SPEAKER(S): None


ACTION: Intent to not Certify EIR. Final language July 31, 2003.

- The Planning Department is allowing antennas in buildings that do not meet the FCC.


- The Planning Department does not do the thorough research needed to measure RF emissions and does not consider the usage of multiple fix transmitters that could exceed RF limits.

- There was a community meeting and no one from the community attended the meeting.  There were more than 300 notices sent out.


(-) Diane Drosnes - Ocean Beach Homeowners Condo Association

- He has written to Verizon on short notice because he just recently found out about this.


- He thinks that Verizon was intentionally misleading.


- Verizon does not have exposure from the roof to Golden Gate Park.

Preliminary Recommendation:  Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project as proposed.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of June 26, 2003)


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Sue Hestor - Representing Discretionary Review Applicant


- This project is across the rear of St. Luke's Hospital.


- The neighborhood is a working class neighborhood.


- The project will dislocate the tenant until the completion of the project.


-  There is not a very well thought out solution since the project will be jacked up.


- There is a waste of low-income housing.


- The tenant already pays about 80% of his salary to rent.


- She is asking to not allow this much demolition of the interior, and require a rational alteration to allow the tenant to stay in place. The tenant will not be able to come back because the rent will be much, much higher.


(-) Jose Morales


- He has been living in the property since 1982.


- Because of rent control he has been able to live there affordably with his family.


- He is a senior citizen and with both his Social Security check and income as a tennis instructor, he is able to pay his rent.


- He is asking the Commission to have consideration of his situation.


(-) Lora Traveler - Park Merced Presidents Organization


- The issue here is fairness.  She is deeply concerned that if this project is approved it will result in both displacement and an affordable rent unit being eliminated.


- This will cause economical and emotional distress.


- The Discretionary Review requestor's situation does not permit him to move to another location or pay higher rent.


(-) Chester Zemany - SF Tenants Union


- He has known the tenant for many years.


- It is a terrible thing to displace an elderly person.


- After being involved in this case, he believes that the real reason for this is to increase the rent of a rent controlled unit.


(-) Steven Shubert


- He urges the Commission to deny the permit.


- This is a displacement of a senior citizen on an extremely limited income who has been active in the community as well as a valued neighbor.


- Homelessness is a real concern right now.


- There are ways that this project could be done.


- Ms. Hestor has come up with real alternatives.


(-) Sam Dodge


- He has known Mr. Morales for many years.


- It breaks his hear to force this person out of the community.


- This building is very historically significant so there are ways to preserve the building.


- Mr. Morales was involved in fighting for the rights of a senior citizen in a similar situation in the Western Addition so it is ironic that he is here fighting for Mr. Morales now.


(-) Ted Gullicksen - San Francisco Tenants Union


- This is a loss for diversity, and senior citizens are very vulnerable.


- A senior citizen will lose his home.


- Many tenants do not return after such evictions.


- Granting this approval will be the decision to evict Mr. Morales.


(-) Bob Coleman - Golden Gateway Tenants Association


- This case caught his attention because of the great contributions of Mr. Morales.


- He is proud with what Ms. Hestor has done on the case.


(-) Leon Low


- He is here to speak on behalf of Mr. Morales.


- The point here is that Mr. Morales is close to the edge.  It is just about dollars and cents.


(+) Ara Tehlirian - Project Sponsor


- He purchased this property a few years ago but was not living there.  He now wants to move back to San Francisco and live in this property with his wife and child.


- Mr. Morales has the right to claim financial hardship.


- He is willing to do everything that is required of him as a landlord.


- Everyone who has spoken and are in support of taking Discretionary Review do not live in the neighborhood.


- He urged the Commission to not delay this project further.


(+) Charles Ng - Project Designer/Contractor - Best Design Construction


- The project sponsor has no intention of evicting Mr. Morales.


- This project is an alteration and not a demolition.


- The project will provide better conditions for the tenants and will provide parking.


- The building has a brick foundation so there is a lot of structural work that needs to be done.


- He urges the Commission to approve the project as proposed.


(-) Miguel Williams


- The reason he opposes this project is the issue of affordable housing.


- There is nothing enforceable to evict the tenant.


- There will be a curb cut, which will make it not pedestrian friendly.


- He urges the Commission to oppose this project.
