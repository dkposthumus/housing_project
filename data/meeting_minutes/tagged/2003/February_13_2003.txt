STONESTOWN VILLAGE PROJECT - 3251 20TH AVENUE - Public Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Report:  The project site is located on the south side of Eucalyptus Drive, immediately west and northwest of the Stonestown Galleria shopping center. The proposal includes a mixed-use development comprising approximately 366,800 gross square feet (gsf) on approximately 13.7 acres primarily used as surface parking for the shopping center.  The proposed development includes both residential and neighborhood-serving retail components.  The residential component includes three five-story, 50-foot-tall apartment buildings, approximately 96,250 gsf, 71,400 gsf, and 62,350 gsf, respectively, with 202 subsurface parking spaces; and a two- to three-story, approximately 30-foot-tall senior care facility, totaling approximately 70,300 gsf, with 17 parking spaces.  The proposed retail component includes development of a 27-foot-tall, 41,600-gsf grocery market, and construction of neighborhood-serving retail spaces totaling approximately 24,900 gsf.  The project would include construction of two parking garages and reconfiguration of two surface parking lots that would contain about 1,684 total commercial parking spaces to replace 1,500 existing commercial spaces displaced by the proposed project construction, and provide 184 net new parking spaces to serve the proposed retail uses. The proposed project would also incorporate landscaping features, such as streetscape connections, landscaped walkways, interior courtyards, and open space. To implement this project, the proposed project would require a Conditional Use authorization (CU) to amend the existing Planned Unit Development (PUD) to modify allowable residential density for the apartment community and potentially modify rear yard setback requirements for both residential components. In addition, an amendment of the Zoning Map would be needed to change the height district from 40 feet to 50 feet. The 13.7-acre project site is located in the Lakeshore neighborhood within Assessor's Block 7295 and includes portions of Lots 21, 22, and 23. The site is primarily within a C-2 (Commercial Business) zoning district, and portions are within a 40-X and 65-D height and bulk districts.
                    Preliminary Recommendation:  Receive Comments.  No Action Required. 
                    Note:  Written comments will be received at the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m., on March 3, 2003.

9.          Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
BOS:
Re:  Fourth and Freelon
The Board of Supervisors, acting as a Committee of the Whole, unanimously voted on a +10-0 voted to approve the legislation creating the Fourth and Freelon Special Use District with some minor technical amendments.  This legislation will be considered for a 2nd reading this coming Tuesday, February 18 at which time it will proceed to the Mayor's desk for his signature.  The legislation is only enabling legislation, which would create the appropriate zoning to allow the project itself to proceed through the permitting process.  The next step will be for the project sponsor to submit his building permit and Conditional Use applications to the Department, which this Commission will eventually consider.
Re:  Special Rules Committee Meeting on Monday, February 10, 2003
This was a hearing to consider Supervisor McGoldrick's resolution creating an 11-member Planning Audit Implementation Advisory Group.  As he reported last week, this Advisory Group was proposed in response to a management audit of the Planning Department that was conducted last year by the Budget Analyst.  While the Department agrees with the spirit and intent of the resolution in that the Department is committed to the implementation of the recommendations of the audit, staff did not agree that this would be best carried out by the formation of yet a new deliberative body that would expend additional staff resources.  After some debate, the members of the Rules Committee agreed that the matter might best be handled by this current Planning Commission or by a special Audits Committee of the Board.  The resolution was continued at the call of the chair.
Re:  Land Use Committee Meeting – Monday, February 24, 2003 – 1:00 p.m.
1) JFK Drive Saturday Closure – The Planning Department published a Negative Declaration on November 30, 2002.  The appeal deadline was December 20, 2002.  There were no appeals filed.  The Final Negative Declaration was adopted on January 6, 2003.
2) The Committee will consider making the cottages at 1338 Filbert Street a landmark.  The Landmarks Board considered this matter last year, and the Planning Commission voted to not recommend making the cottages a landmark.  The Land Use Committee will still consider this matter on February 24, 2003.

SPEAKER(S):
(+) Lois Scott
- She is here representing the Planner's Chapter of Professional and Technical Engineers – Local 21
- She complemented this Commission on their thoughtful comments and advocacy on this subject.
- She presented to the Commission a letter with suggestions, which actually almost reflects the suggestions the Commissioners have just mentioned.
- She would like more correspondence between the Controller and the Mayor.
- Long range planning should be presented in a five-year approach.
- She requested that the public hearing be extended.
(+) John Elberling
- About Discretionary Reviews, he would like the Commission to look at alternatives.
- If there are abuses to the Discretionary Review process, then perhaps having the Zoning Administrator look at cases before coming to the Commission would help.
- The issue of code enforcement is very much a topic in community meetings.
- A good proposal just needs to be explored and implemented.

436 CLEMENTINA STREET - Appeal of a Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration - Assessor's Block 3732, Lot 62. The site is part of the major city block bounded by Howard Street to the north, Folsom Street to the south, 5th Street to the east, and 6th Street to the west within the South of Market neighborhood. Clementina and Tehama Streets are minor streets bisecting this city block. The proposed project would demolish the existing one-story, 5,000-square-foot warehouse on this 5,625-square-foot site and construct 28 residential condominium units over approximately 1,250 square feet (sq. ft.) of ground-floor commercial space, and eight off-street parking spaces within a new eight-story structure. The proposed structure would be approximately 37,975 sq. ft. and 85 feet in height, an increase of 32,348 sq. ft. and seven stories in height above the existing structure. The project site is located within the RSD (Residential Service Mixed-Use) zoning district and within the 40-X/85-B height and bulk district. Projects within the RSD zoning district require a conditional use authorization to determine the residential density for buildings over 40 feet in height. The project site is also within the South of Market Redevelopment Plan Area..
                    Preliminary Recommendation: Uphold Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration.
                    (Continued from Regular Meeting of December 5, 2002)

- He is a member of SPUR.
- He read a letter from Jim Chappell of SPUR who is not supporting this project.

(-) Tom Coler
- The shadow impact on his home will be dramatic.
- He would not be here if this building would be below the 40 foot limit.
- He is in favor of development but his concern is the number of units, which are still unsold and vacant in the neighborhood, and now this building will bring more units.
- This building will also be out-of-scale with the neighborhood.
(-) Laura Weil
- She is concerned with parking.
- Her driveway is practically blocked everyday.
- This building will also block the light coming into her home.
- The benefit does not out weight the cost of this project.
(-) Allison Kohler – Tehama Street Neighborhood Association
- She lives behind the proposed project.
- This building towers over everything on Clementina and Tehama Streets.
(-) David Bushnell – 450 Architects and Clementina Neighborhood Association

- This project does not comply with many of the criteria of the Planning Code.
- There are questions of consistency of scale and adequate off street parking, etc.

                    Preliminary Recommendation:  Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project as submitted. Take discretionary review and approve the project with proposed modifications.

Note:  Four of the Five Discretionary Review requests have been withdrawn.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Kathleen Morse – Discretionary Review Requestor
- She recently purchased the property next door to the subject property.
- The units in the building she recently purchased are quite small and the subject property will block light into these units.
- Although she does not live in the building, she is voicing the issues the tenants have.
(-) Bob Nicholson
- He lives in the apartment complex next door to the subject property.
- He plans to remain and live in the unit so any consideration the Commission will give to renters would be appreciated.
(-) Patricia Voughey
- The architect would not return her phone calls.
- The Commission should consider the people living in these units since the proposed construction will block their light.
(-) Dennis Doyle
- He manages the apartment complex next door to the proposed property.
- There is not much light and air that the apartment
- Whatever compromise which may have been reached with the neighbor on the other side of 2750 Greenwich, apparently it is not going to be accorded to them in the apartment building because when the building is extended there will be a solid fire wall which will make it a very intrusive building.
(-) Mark English – Project Architect (for four neighbors to the west)
- He did come to an agreement after a great deal of work with the Del Santos and their project architect.  
- The withdrawal of four of the Discretionary Review requestors is based on mitigating the massing and loss of light and air to Susan Newfield to the west, the building was pulled back on the top two levels about two feet, also an open railing for both the terrace at the top of the first level and the cantilever balcony.
(+) Joel Yodowitz – Reuben and Alter – Project Sponsor
- This is the first time that he has seen the Discretionary Review requestor.
- The fact that there were four Discretionary Review withdrawals out of five means that there were several meetings and a lot of negotiations.  No one was excluded from these meetings.
- The agreement from these DR requestors was mostly made possible by the Cow Hollow Neighborhood Association.
- The project sponsors intend to have children and live there for many years.
- The project cannot be cut back further.
(+) Bill Peschell – Project Architect
- This project is very modest and small.
(+) Frank Del Santo – Project Sponsor
- He has always tried to make his project compatible with the neighborhood.
- People were still unhappy yet he has worked hard to compromise.
ACTION:          Took Discretionary Review and approved with the following modifications: Provide a three-foot setback from the west side property line for all floors of the rear extension.  The three-foot setback shall start at the rear (north) wall of the adjacent building to the west.  Windows shall be permitted within the setback area.
          The rear wall of the first (ground) floor shall extend no further than 74 feet  from the front property line.
          The rear wall of the second and third floor shall be held at the 45-percent rear yard line, exclusive of the cantilevered deck proposed at the third floor.  The cantilevered deck shall extend no more than 4 feet 6 inches from the rear wall and be set back three feet from both side property lines.  The cantilevered deck shall have an open railing.

2616 UNION STREET - north side between Divisadero and Broderick Streets; Lot 006 in Assessor’s Block 0946 - Staff-initiated request for Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application No. 2002.05.23.7377 filed to authorize the relocation of the west wall of a new deck built at the rear of this single-family house.  Contrary to the wall location approved by the Planning Commission on May 25, 2000 in their consideration of Discretionary Review Case No. 2000.331D, filed on Building Permit Application No. 2000.01.27.446, the stucco wall was built to the west side property line.  The plans approved by the Commission at that time indicated the west wall of the deck to be located approximately 8 inches away from the west side property line.  The subject property is located within an RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and disapprove the application.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Merel Glaubiger – Discretionary Review Requestor
- She and her husband have owned property next door from the project sponsor for many years.
- She is opposed to this project for various reasons but stated that the built in barbecue does not have a permit and is a fire hazard.
(+) Daniel Glaubiger
-There is an intentional violation to the planning process.
- The barbecue his wife spoke about is above the firewall, which defeats the purpose.
- When this case came before the Commission a few years ago, the Commission took Discretionary Review to make modifications.
(-) Daniel G. Archer – Project Architect
- He requested that the barbecue in question be moved so that it does not become a hazard.
- The issues are that there are citizens that can ignore past promises and that they can ignore the government--in this case the Planning Commission and Discretionary Review board.
(+) Alice Barkley – Project Sponsor
- The property owner acknowledged that before they moved into this house they hired an architect and a licensed contractor who did not construct what was agreed upon.
- The project sponsor is willing to remove the permanent barbecue and use a portable one instead.
(+) Mike Malone
- He and his wife purchased the property in 1998.  It required massive renovation.  He moved into another place while the construction was going on and obviously hired people who did not do the job well.
- He went through all the approval processes.  He thought that he and his wife had moved into a home that had all the proper permits.
- He moved into the house about two years ago and has started a family.
- He has had a very good relationship with all of his neighbors.
ACTION:          Took Discretionary Review and approved with the following modifications:  Remove the permanent barbeque (including the gas line) on the rear deck and adjacent to the west side property line.  (The use of a portable barbeque at this location is permitted.)

111  MANCHESTER  STREET –  east side,  south of  Stoneman Street, Lot 019 in Assessor’s Block 5544 – Two Discretionary Review requests, the first initiated by Department Staff, pursuant to Planning Commission residential demolition policy, of Building Permit Application Number 2002.04.22.4580, which would demolish an existing single family dwelling, and the second initiated by a member of the public, of Building Permit Application Number 2002.04.22.4585, which would construct a new single family dwelling on the same site. The property is located in an RH-1 (Residential, House, One-Family) District, the Bernal Heights Special Use District, and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary  Recommendation:  Do  not  take  Discretionary  Review  and approve the project.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Kendall Goh – Discretionary Review Requestor
- Because there was confusion regarding the time limit to submit a Discretionary Review request she is the only DR requestor.  Otherwise, there would be more.
- She lives adjacent to the proposed project.
- She and her neighbors as well as the North West Bernal Design Review Board oppose this project.
- The proposed structure is disruptive to the visual character of the neighborhood in direct contrast to the residential design guidelines.
- The project is too tall, out of scale and it's not compatible to the surrounding buildings.
- They also dispute that the current house should be torn down because it has been neglected.
- The demolition of the existing building will eliminate affordable housing.  Low income tenants were actually evicted.
- This project will also set a precedent encouraging other developers to tear down the Bernal Victorian cottages.
- The light and air of adjacent properties will be impaired because of this project.
(-) Beth Newman
- She would have been another DR requestor but there was a misunderstanding and she wasn't able to submit.
- It appears that the City rewards people for neglecting their houses and/or rental properties.
- She is opposed to the demolition.
(-) Jeff Berzan
- He would also have filed a Discretionary Review request.
- He opposes this project because he believes it is too large.  
(-) Christopher Burt
- He would just like to add that the three bedrooms are larger than 100 square feet as was mentioned in the design review notes.
(-) Virginia L. Rhea
- She lives on Manchester Street.
- She is opposed to the demolition.  The tenants should not have been asked to leave.
- This project will block light and air from adjacent buildings.
- She passed a letter to the Commission from a neighbor who is opposed to the project.
- This house is also too tall and it just does not fit into the neighborhood.
- She also passed a petition from more than 100 neighbors who oppose the construction.
(-) Dennis Davenport
- His house would have qualified as a tear down but he chose to remodel.
- He cannot believe the claim from the project sponsor that it would be less expensive to demolish and reconstruct than to just remodel.
- He is against the demolition and against the height and volume of the new construction.
(-) Arthur D. Levy
- He would like the Commission to grant Discretionary Review and disapprove the project since the demolition fails to comply with the demolition restrictions in the Bernal Heights special Use District.
(-) Gail Sansbury – North West Bernal Design Review Board
- The Board is against this project because it is too large and this makes the project out of character with the adjacent buildings.
- Many neighbors attended the community meetings and they expressed overwhelming concerns about the height and the negative impact on the adjacent properties.
- The Board suggested that the 4th floor be eliminated and then they would consider approval of the project.
(-) Rebecca Rhine
- This project is totally out of scale with the neighborhood.
(-) Dean Fernandes
- He is not supporting the demolition and new construction of this project because it is a monster home.
(-) Ron Trauner
- He lives across the street from the proposed home.
- He realizes that he will loose some of his view yet he is more concerned about how this project will change the character of the street.
- He recommends that the Commission disapprove the project or have the project sponsor eliminate the top story.
(-) Ginger Ray – speaking on behalf of Rolf G. Kvalvik
- He and his family are against this project because it is out of scale and out of context with the character of the neighborhood. 
(-) Morris Quinlan
- He is against this project because it is out of scale with the neighborhood.
(-) Ron Reiner
- He opposes the construction of this house because it does not go with the neighborhood.
(-) Annette Schubert
- She is opposed to the construction of this house.
(-) Laure Hansen
- She is against the construction.
(-) Dell Crouse
- He is against this project because it is out of character with the rest of the houses on the street.

- He has been working on this project for over a year.
- Many of the neighbors who spoke have seen the drawings for this project and he also presented the project at the Bernal Design Board.
- He moved into the neighborhood a few years ago.  He was also part of the inception of the Bernal Heights Special Use District.
- He described the architectural aspects of the new construction.
- He submitted a letter from the Project Sponsor who was not able to attend the hearing.
