B. COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
 


5. Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner Bradford Bell:


Re:  Scheduling Cases in September


- In an effort to explore ways to better prioritize the Commission calendar, she instructed the Commission Secretary to implement a trial procedure in September only that would calendar Discretionary Review cases on a date by themselves and all other cases on alternate hearing dates.  In essence, every other Thursday would be for Discretionary Review and the alternate Thursdays would items that are usually on our regular calendar.  In early October the Commission would have to calendar an item that would allow us to discuss and analyze the effectiveness of this trial procedure and determine whether or not we want to continue, modify, or abandon it.


Re:  Miscellaneous Questions


- What EIR's are coming up in September?


- Can the Housing Element be scheduled as a special meeting again?


Commissioner Sue Lee:


Re:  Director Green's departure


- She requested to have scheduled on the next agenda, the issue of Director Green's imminent departure and to get clarity and a status report on what the interim management team for the Department is while he is gone.


Re:  Receiving Informational/briefing material in a timely manner


- She would like informational/briefing material at least one week prior to the hearing instead of the evening before the hearing.  This way Commissioners are better prepared to make decisions on the cases before us.


Commissioner Feldstein:


She requested the following information:


Re:  Workload:


- Calendar a discussion about workload and calendar preparation.  In that discussion, we should explore ways of better managing the calendar, which might include more direct commissioner input into calendar preparation.


Re:  Timeliness:


- She will be requesting that items be continued if she does not receive updated information in a timely manner.


Re:  Scheduling:


- Only under emergency circumstances should more than one meeting be scheduled in a week.


Re:  Feedback:


- She would like to receive the action list (which contains Commissioner's requests) no less than once a month, or whenever any item on it changes, whichever is more frequent.


Re:  Planning vs. Projects:


- She requested that from this point forward presentations about true planning issues be allocated as much time as the presenters need to make complete presentations.


Re:  Director:


- She would like to schedule on the calendar the issue of the Commission be given the opportunity for input into the process of who the managing staff will be as Director Green leaves the position of Planning Director.


Re:  Discretionary Reviews:


- Some months ago, the Commission began to discuss streamlining the Discretionary Review process.  She requested that this item be calendared for discussion to move the issue forward.


Re: 11x17 plans


- She instructed that project sponsors be responsible for providing to staff/Commission 20 copies of project plans that are 11''x17.''


Commissioner Antonini:


- He agrees with what Commissioners have said.  He feels that these are items that need to be addressed.


Re:  Informational material in a timely manner


- He understands that projects are constantly changing that requires updates that need to be sent to Commissioners via faxes/phone calls, often on the morning of a hearing.  He feels that Commissioners just need to do the best they can to review that material.  Although he agrees that the earlier they can get the material, the better.


Commissioner Boyd:


- He also agrees with the request made by Commissioners regarding getting information in a timely manner.


- Site visits and presentations take a lot of time so scheduling this in a timely manner will help to organize the Commission's calendars.


Commissioner Bill Lee:


- He understands the amount of time that Commissioners need and the economic impact.  He feels that having more Commission meetings are a good idea.  He realizes that Saturdays are a religious holidays for some and that Sundays City Hall is closed.


Commissioner Hughes:


Re:  Items that get continued


- He realizes that there are some continuations that the Commission can control and some that they cannot.


- He advised project sponsor representatives to do their work well.


C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


6. Director's Announcements


Re:  Efficiency


- There are a lot of factors involved to receiving information in a timely/efficient manner.  The department will do their part on this matter.


Re:  Alternating DRs and Regular Items:


- The department is fast approaching dates to get things noticed for future hearings.  He will act on this quickly.

7. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals


Full Board of Supervisors meeting of July 22, 2003


Re:  3725 Buchanan Street


Appeal of a CU authorizing 8 panel antennas and related equipment on the roof of an existing building as part of Verizon's wireless telecommunications network. (Approved +4-3 on May 1, 2003 by the Commission). The Board did not feel that the antennae were necessary and desirable, and the CU was overturned on an 11-0 vote. 


Re:  40-50 Lansing Street


CU appeal of this 82-unit residential project.


The Board voted to change the building envelope on the Lansing Street side of the building by eliminating 4 units there. Additionally, they amended the project to place the loading dock on-site as opposed to across the street, which eliminated a total of 5 dwelling units in the building. The total number of units therefore was reduced from 82 to 77, which includes the loss of an affordable unit--reduced from 10 affordable units in the original project to 9 in the revised project. Assuming that the project sponsor keeps the same 70/30% ratio on the type of affordable units as they reflect the total number of units, this will mean a loss of 1 affordable two-bedroom unit.


Re:  3537 19TH ST (19
th
 Street PG&E transformer)


Appeal of the CU to authorize six antennas and backup equipment located on the building's rooftop for AT&T Wireless. Appealed by neighborhood signatures.  This project was overturned by an 8-1 vote, with Supervisor Peskin dissenting.

<<Project Start>>


8. Set hearing date to discuss the Department's priorities.


SPEAKERS: None


ACTION: Hearing Held.  Through Commission discussion, it was decided that this item would be calendared for September 4, 2003.


D. PUBLIC COMMENT ON AGENDA ITEMS WHERE THE PUBLIC HEARING HAS BEEN CLOSED






At this time, members of the public who wish to address the Commission 
      on agenda items that have already been reviewed in a public hearing at which 
      members of the public were allowed to testify and the public hearing has 
      been closed, must do so at this time. Each member of the public may address 
      the Commission for up to three minutes.


SPEAKER(S):


Re: 1509 Taraval Street


Reza Kitoshnerisan - SIA Consulting Engineers


- They had proposed a three unit building and his client is asking for 
      two commercial areas and the two residential units at the top levels. This 
      would bring the required parking to two spaces.


- Therefore the project has been modified.


Re: Golden Gate Park Concourse Authority Projects


Pinky Kushner - Sierra Club


- She would like to delay the EIR approval because rushing into the approval 
      would delay and make things more complicated.


- There have been comments put into the document.


- The EIR should be approved based on what the Commissioner reads and not 
      on what people say.


Alison Brown - California Academy of Sciences


- She asks that the Commission act today and certify the EIR.


Wade Randal


- The expeditious approval of the EIR is critical.


- There is a strong majority of San Franciscans that want this garage built 
      and want the pedestrian access to the music concourse.


Gwyneth Borden - SF Chamber of Commerce


- It is important to implement what the voters asked for.


- Having the cars in a garage will eliminate fumes from cars looking around 
      for parking near the park.


Tomasita Medal - Park Access for All


- The tunnels are dark and uninviting. Usually they smell like urine.


- She urges the Commission to certify the EIR today.


John Laskin


- If he were a developer he would build parking in high-rises.


- He is not against the garage but would like a better proposal.


Re: 201 Folsom/300 Spear


Michael Nulty


-- The EIR speaks to the issue of affordable housing because San Francisco 
      needs it and it is quite important.


- He looks forward to seeing this happen.

SPEAKER(S):


Margaret Mori - ASLA

- The tunnels are deteriorating beyond repair.


- He urges the Commission to get the document correct before approving it.


Greg Miller


- He is a strong advocate for preserving all the trees when this project is constructed.


- The EIR does address the issue of the trees.  It states that the removal of the trees will not constitute an impairment of the landmark status.


- He recommended that the Commission look at this closely.


Katherine Howard - ASLA Historic Preservation - Landscape Architect


- The draft EIR states that the landscaping of the project will remove many trees.


- The trees are of historic significance and should be preserved.


Mary Anne Miller


- She believes that the tunnels are a historic resource.


- In the document, it states that the trees are a historic resource.


- She requested that the Commission make a finding today on the issue of the pedestrian tunnels.


Jim Chappell - President of SPUR


- The job of the Commission is to determine if the EIR is accurate and complete.  There is no question that this document is complete and should be certified.


- The trees are not part of the project response.  Removal of the trees is not part of the project.


- The tunnels will be eliminated for new 21
st
 century use.


- There will be an improvement on the traffic impact.


- He urged the Commission to certify this document.

- She is also concerned of what the park will look like in the future.


- She feels that the garage solution is inconspicuous, effective and will be a great boom for future generations.


Carolyn Blair - SF Tree Council - Urban Forest Council Member

GOLDEN GATE PARK CONCOURSE AUTHORITY PROJECTS
 - 
Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR)
 - The site is between the California Academy of Sciences and the M.H. de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park, called the Music Concourse area.  In 1998, voters of San Francisco approved Proposition J, Golden Gate Park Revitalization Act, to improve the landscape and pedestrian environment of the Music Concourse area.  Phase I of the proposed project would include an underground parking facility of 800 to 1,000 spaces at the Music Concourse, surface improvements, and transportation improvements in the Concourse area, and throughout Golden Gate Park, as described in Proposition J.  Proposition J requires removal of surface parking spaces from the Concourse area, and in locations throughout the Park, equivalent to the number of spaces provided in the new underground parking facility upon completion of the parking facility. In addition to the underground parking facility, the Transportation Implementation Plan includes the following elements: intra-park shuttle, cultural shuttle, traffic calming, parking management, bicycle and pedestrian improvements, road closures, and MUNI service improvements. Phase II of the project would entail construction of an Underground Through Street connecting Fulton Street to Middle Drive East, which would allow for through traffic to be restricted or eliminated from Tea Garden Drive and Academy Drive. The proposed underground roadway would ramp down at Eighth Avenue at Kennedy Drive and would extend beneath the east end of the Concourse and alongside the east side of the California Academy of Sciences, where it would ramp up to Middle Drive East.  This underground street would not provide access into the parking garage and would be intended to reduce cross-park vehicular traffic through the Music Concourse.  The project site is within the P (Public Use) zoning district and within an OS (Open Space) Height and Bulk District; Assessor's Block 1700, Lot 1.


Since publication of the Draft EIR, the Executive Director of the Project Sponsor, Concourse Authority, notified the Planning Department that the preferred project as analyzed in the DEIR has been revised.  The project, as revised, consists of Phase I, the Underground Parking Facility, and the Transportation Improvement Measures ("TIP"), both as analyzed as part of the preferred project in the DEIR.  Phase II, the Underground Through Street, has been severed from the project and removed from further consideration.  As a consequence, the preferred project, as revised, is Phase I and the TIP elements only.  This project was identified in the DEIR as Alternative B.  With the severance of Phase II, the project, as revised, has no physical environmental impact on the historic character of the Rhododendron Dell, an area of Golden Gate Park considered individually eligible for listing on the California Register of Historical Resources.  As a result, the project, as revised, has eliminated the significant unavoidable impact to this resource that was identified in the DEIR.


Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the EIR as a Final EIR.  Please note the public review period for the DEIR ended at 5:00 pm, February 5, 2003. 
Public hearing has been closed.


NOTE
:  On July 17, 2003, the Commission passed a motion of intent to not Certify the EIR by a vote of +6-0. Commissioner Boyd absent.

201 FOLSOM STREET
 - 
Certification of Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) - 
The rezoning of parcels in the Rincon Hill neighborhood (the "rezoning project") and a residential development of approximately 1,500,000 gross square feet (gsf) at 201 Folsom Street (the "development" project).  The property is currently used as a paved parking lot by the United States Postal Service (USPS) Annex and other government agencies for 270 vehicles.  The rezoning project includes rezoning part of Lot 1 in Assessor's Block 3746 and Lots 1 and 8 in Assessor's Block 3745 from the existing P (Public) to a zoning district that allows private development.  The requested rezoning is from P (Public) with height limits of 150 and 200 feet to RC-4 (Residential-Commercial Combined: High-Density) with a 300- and 400-foot height limit.  In addition, a Planning Code text amendment is requested to create a new Residential/Commercial sub-district under the Rincon Hill Special Use District overlay, and amendments to the 
Rincon Hill Area Plan
, a part of the 
San Francisco General Plan
.  The request for rezoning has been made in conjunction with development proposed at 300 Spear Street on Assessor's Block 3745, Lot 1, that would be a part of the rezoned area.  The third parcel requested to be rezoned is 345 Main Street, Lot 8 in Assessor's Block 3745, the remaining privately owned lot in the existing P district. The development portion of the project would consist of up to 725 residential units (about 825,000 gsf) and about 38,000 gsf of retail space.  It would include about 753 enclosed parking spaces and four loading spaces for the use of the development, and about 272 enclosed replacement parking spaces for the use of the USPS and other government agencies.  An 80-foot-tall building base would cover the site.  Two residential towers would rise above the building base to total heights of approximately 350 feet and 400 feet above the ground level.  The project would require a subdivision of Lot 1 to separate the development site from the Postal Service Annex.


Preliminary Recommendation:  Certify the EIR as a Final EIR.  Please note that the public review period for the Draft EIR ended at 5 pm, December 2, 2002.  
Public Hearing Closed.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of June 26, 2003)


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Jim Chappell - President of SPUR


- He has read and studied the EIRs in reasonable detail and he is confident that they are adequate and correct and should be certified.


- There is a terrible shortage of housing and this is causing families to leave the city.  


- There are singles that are doubling, tripling and quadrupling in units because they cannot afford to live in single units.


- He hopes that the Commission will certify the EIRs.


(+) Jeffrey Leibovitz


- The EIRs only state that the projects will not shadow South Park.


- Revenue needs to be captured from these projects.


- The EIRs are not adequate addressing the impacts this will have on the Park and Recreation properties in the Rincon Hill neighborhoods.


- The immediate parks don't have adequate facilities, and that is what he is asking the Commission to do.


(-) Reed Bement - President of the Rincon Hill Neighborhood Association


- He urges the Commission to "do the right thing".


- He believes in this area and that is why he lives there.  This area should be developed.


- These projects are not in a position to be developed.


- There are still a lot of matters that have not been discussed in the EIRs.


(-) Andrew Brooks - General Manager of Baycrest Residential Association


- The Comment and Responses section of the EIR under the visual quality and urban design section shows photo simulations of alternatives B, C and D.  However, all of the viewpoint locations called for in the EIR were not added.


- In the Transportation section of the EIR:  under the Intersection Operating Conditions, it states that turning movement volumes were counted prior to the closure of Beale Street.  CEQA requires the EIR to represent conditions as they currently exist at the time of evaluation and/or approval.  New updated figures need to be included to give an accurate representation of Intersection Levels of Service.  Under the Construction Traffic section, it states that the Giants Ballpark construction was not identified as a significant impact.  This response is not accurate and is in error.


(-) Patrick Malone - Rincon Hill Residents 


- He is here to support the Rincon Hill neighbors and request that you not certify the EIR.


- Public input has not been given and there is no comprehensive plan.


- The EIR is insufficient because it fails to adequately address the cumulative affects on the construction of the projects.


- It does not address the Bay Bridge retrofit project.


- It does not address the traffic problems that were set by the 9/11 incident.


(-) Bobbie Carter


- She lives in the SOMA area.


- She is very concerned about the EIR.


- One of the greatest concerns she has is the height of the buildings.  Forty stories will definitely impact the neighborhood.


- This is a very limited area in the city that should be preserved.


- There are many issues that need to be addressed so she urges the Commission to not certify this document.


(-) Henry Kleinhenz - Baycrest


- Many of the residents who live in Rincon Hill are not against development or housing.


- Whatever projects go on should conform to the existing density that is already established in the Rincon Hill plan.


- He is very concerned that there will be four buildings that are too tall.


(-) Sue Hestor


- There is a lack of a plan or an analysis of this EIR.


- The EIR slides over the issue that there is no plan.


- There are other developments in the area which are either going on or are planned yet they are not mentioned in the EIR.


(-) Jo Howard


- She asked the Commission to seriously look at the impact of changing the height limit for a specific project before Rincon Hill has been evaluated.


- It is unfair to give the benefit to developers, to have more units with higher heights in the area.


- The financial district is the financial district but this project is residential housing.

300 SPEAR STREET
 - 
Certification of Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) -
The project includes rezoning of parcels in the Rincon Hill neighborhood (the "rezoning project") and a mixed-use development of approximately 1,560,000 gross square feet (gsf) at 300 Spear Street (the "development project").  The property is currently used as a paved parking lot for 290 vehicles.  The property was formerly owned by Caltrans and under lease to Golden Gate Transit for daytime commuter bus layovers. Golden Gate Transit buses were relocated a few blocks away in 2000.  The rezoning project includes rezoning Lots 1 and 8 in Assessor's Block 3745, and part of Lot 1 in Assessor's Block 3746 from the existing P (Public) to a zoning district that allows private development.  The requested rezoning is from P (Public) with height limits of 105, 150 and 200 feet to RC-4 (Residential-Commercial Combined:  High Density) with 300- and 400-foot height limits.  In addition, a Planning Code text amendment is requested to create a new Residential/Commercial subdistrict under the Rincon Hill Special Use District overlay, and amendments to the Rincon Hill Area Plan, a part of the San Francisco General Plan.  The request for rezoning has been made in conjunction with the proposed development at 201 Folsom Street on Assessor's Block 3746, Lot 1, that would be a part of the rezoned area.  The third parcel requested to be rezoned is 345 Main Street, Lot 8 in Assessor's Block 3745, the remaining privately owned lot in the existing P district. The development portion of the project would consist of up to 820 residential units, about 36,000 gsf of retail and about 890 underground parking spaces.  Two 80-foot-tall building bases would be built to the property lines on Spear, Folsom and Main Streets; the building bases would surround a landscaped courtyard beginning at the courtyard (third) level.  Two residential towers would rise above the building bases to total heights of approximately 350 feet and 400 feet above the ground level, respectively.

- He is asking to be part of the community planning process for this area.


- This project is not good for the neighborhood.


(-) Reed Bement - President of the Rincon Hill Neighborhood Association


- He believes in high density housing but this area is not a "waste land".

- The towers will also create a visual block to people coming into the City.


- There are still many problems to deal with.


(+) Tim Tosta - Steefel, Levit and Weiss


- There is a list of schools that are nearby.


- They have carefully developed the plans for these projects over a number of years.

 - southwest corner at the intersection of Union and Buchanan Streets; Lot 024 in Assessor's Block 0541 -  Request for Conditional Use authorization pursuant to Section 725.83, of the Planning Code to install six (6) cellular antennas and five (5) related equipment cabinets on the roof of the Union Street Plaza Building, as part of Sprint PCS' telecommunications network within the Union Street Neighborhood Commercial District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.  The proposed antennas would be flush mounted to an existing rooftop penthouse, and the related equipment would be housed in a new mechanical penthouse that would be partially visible from the street below.  The site is considered a Preference 2 under the City & County of San Francisco's Wireless Telecommunications Services (WTS) Facilities Siting Guidelines, as it is a "co-location" site. However, due to a prior Planning Commission action and approved Motion No. 16084 for case no 2000.0385C the site had been deemed a Preference 6.  The Planning Commission will consider under which Preference (2 or 6) to review the application.
