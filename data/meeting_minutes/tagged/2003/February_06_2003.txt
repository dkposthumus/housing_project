6.                    Commission Comments/Questions
Commissioner Antonini:
1) Re:  Stonestown Project
He has consulted with the City Attorney's office to see if he will be able to participate on this case.  We are trying to determine if I live within 500 feet of the project.  The City Attorney's office will let him know.
2) Re:  Backlog of Projects
He would like to have the department explore various ways to open up more days and/or add more time to each hearing in order to consider Planning Commission cases.  There have been a few cases that had to be continued creating a backlog.  There are some projects that have serious economic consequences if they are delayed.  Perhaps some options would be:  1) making the 5th Thursday of the month a hearing date; 2) starting earlier than 1:30 p.m.; 3) adding an additional evening session in the month.  He would like planning staff to look at these three options to see which would be the most cost 
effective.
Commissioner Boyd:
Re:  Backlog of Projects
He would like to ask staff how extensive the backlog of projects is.  This would make him understand and consider the proposals from Commissioner Antonini.  He would not be in support of having the 5th Thursday of the month as a hearing date.  He would be in support of starting earlier.
Commissioner Bradford Bell:  
She is aware of the concerns from the Commissioners.  She would like the Director, the Commission Secretary and herself  to discuss these concerns and get back to the Commission.

8.          Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
BOS – Report by John Paul Samaha
Re:  Glen Park Marketplace Project
- The Board unanimously voted to uphold the Conditional Use Authorization granted by the Planning Commission at its December 5, 2002 hearing.
Re:  Fourth and Freelon Special Use District
- The Board, acting as a committee as a whole, introduced amendments on this project.  Supervisor Daly, the sponsor of the legislation, introduced an amendment that includes most if not all of the recommendations that were made by the Planning Commission at its January 9, 2003 hearing.  There were a couple of minor amendments made to the amendment of the whole:  1) one was clarifying language about the offsetting of the land acquisition costs to ensure that no less than 56 affordable units were actually build. 2) language added to ensure that the project sponsor has  insurance against construction defects  for the affordable housing units off-site.
- The Board of Supervisors could not vote on the amendment of the whole since the City Attorney deemed the amendments substantive.  The matter was continued for one week, when the Committee of the Whole will hold another hearing and vote on the legislation at its February 11, 2003.
Re:  Land Use Committee
- The members of the new Land Use Committee have been established, with the exception of Supervisor Sophie Maxwell.  The Committee Chair will be Supervisor Jake McGoldrick; the Vice Chair will be Supervisor Tony Hall and the other member will be Supervisor Amiano.  This Committee will meet every Monday at 1:00 p.m. beginning February 17, 2003.  This will be a trial period for about 4 to 6 weeks, at which point the Committee might reconsider the need to hold Committee meetings on a weekly basis.
Re:  New Legislation Introduced
1) Supervisor McGoldrick has re-introduced 2 pieces of legislation that had previously been sponsored by former Supervisor Mark Leno:
a) Ordinance amending the Planning Code to create and establish controls for Transit-oriented Neighborhood Commercial (NC-T) Districts and Transit-Intensive Special Use Districts.
b) Ordinance amending the Planning Code section 253 that currently requires Conditional Use approval for residential construction over 40 feet in residential districts with height limits over 40 fee to add an exception for housing projects that include at least 12 percent affordable units and meet other requirements of the Inclusionary Affordable Housing Program.
2) Supervisor Hall introduced the ordinance designating the Laguna Honda Station, also known as the Forest Hill Station, at 390 Laguna Honda Boulevard as a landmark.  The designation had been initiated by the Landmarks Advisory Board and has already been passed by this Planning Commission.  It will now proceed to the Land Use Committee of the Board for action.
Re:  Special Rules Committee
- There will be a special Rules Committee meeting this coming Monday, February 10, 2003 at 2:30 p.m. to consider Supervisor McGoldrick's resolution creating an 11-member Planning-Audit Implementation Advisory Group.
BOA
Hearing of January 29, 2003:
Re: 1469 18th Street (Lingba Lounge) 
Bar on Potrero Hill in an NC-2 district.  There is a new owner and he has been operating in a different way--he has sought a place of entertainment permit that would allow him to have a DJ (which requires a police permit).  The Police Department referred this permit to the Planning Department.  On September 9, the Planning Department mailed out a Section 312 Notice for a change of Use to add the Place of Entertainment permit.  On September 18, 2002, the Police Department disapproved the Place of Entertainment permit, partially based on a lack of response from the Planning Department--although the 30 days for the 312 Notice had not expired.  We were not notified of this disapproval.  A Discretionary Review was filed within the 30 day period and was scheduled for hearing on December 5, 2002.  In late November, we found out that the Place of Entertainment permit had been denied, thus making the DR moot. The Board of Appeals heard the appeal of the Police Department's disapproval on January 29th and held it to the call of the chair so that the Planning Commission could hear the Discretionary Review.  This all means that there should be more communication between the Police Department and the Planning Department.  This case will come before the Commission on March 6, 2003.
Re:  2629 24th Street 
Discretionary Review by a tenant in a building which was being demolished.  This came before the previous Commission.  There were problems with the address because the project sponsor filed it with an address that was different than the one actually on the building.  The previous Commission was concerned about the whole noticing process and denied the building permit, not necessarily because they were opposed to the project, but because they felt that the procedure was not as it should be and that the tenant had not had adequate notice.
This was appealed to the BOA.  They granted the permit because the tenant (the DR applicant) had settled with the project sponsor.

The proposal is to convert an existing 3-level live/work unit into a dwelling unit so that (1) the existing 3rd story could be expanded to accommodate 520 additional square feet of floor area and (2) 170 square feet of floor area could be added within the existing 2nd level . The work would include raising the overall height of the building by up to 7 feet. Planning Code Sections 233 and 181 prohibit the expansion or intensification of live/work units. A Rear Yard Modification, pursuant to Planning Code Section 134(e), is also requested as part of this project.

296 TOWNSEND STREET, a landlocked lot between 4th, Brannan, Townsend, and Lusk Streets; Lot 163 in Assessor's Block 3787: Request for a Rear Yard Modification to allow the creation of a new dwelling unit without the required rear yard. The proposal is to convert an existing live/work unit into a dwelling unit and to perform interior and exterior alterations. Without such modification, Planning Code Sections 134(a)(1) and 134(a)(1)(C) would require that 25 percent of the total lot depth be provided at the lowest story containing a dwelling unit and at each succeeding level. As measured from 4th Street, the total depth of the subject lot is 136 feet; a 34 foot required rear yard is therefore required for the proposed dwelling unit. At all levels of the proposed dwelling, the rearmost 31 feet of the lot are occupied by a 3-story live/work unit. A rear yard is not required for live/work units. The subject property is within an SSO Mixed-Use Zoning District and a 50-X Height and Bulk District.

(+) Don Rob – Project Designer
- This building has many deficiencies.
- The owners and their families occupy both flats and wish to continue to occupy the building as a single family residence.

(+) Roger Miller 
- He hopes that the Commission will consider their reasons for this project before making their decision.

- He and his wife plan to have more children and to have both sets of parents live with them.  
- It is difficult to go up and down stairs with keys to access a separate unit.  It's just very difficult when there is a toddler around.

Preliminary Recommendation:  Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project as submitted.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Audrey Fucilla Carlson – Discretionary Review Requestor
- She is opposed to this project because it would have a dramatic negative effect on the light and air that comes into her property--it would block four windows.

- Her request is for the project sponsor to move the addition at the third and fourth level three feet to the west.
(-) Ivan Fucilla
- He supports the right of the project sponsor to reasonably expand her property.
- However, the light and air would be unnecessarily compromised by an excessively high firewall.

- Yet there are issues of courtesy and consideration to ones neighbors.
- The Discretionary Review requestor is asking for reasonable modifications.
(-) Stephanie Fredericks

- It is unfortunate that the project sponsor was not able to accommodate the Discretionary Review requestors reasonable modifications.
- The majority of the neighbors support the Discretionary Review requestor.

- The proposed fire wall is unnecessarily high.
- Her biggest concern is her mentally-disabled grandson.  Since he has to spend so much time at home, reduced sunlight would have a significant negative effect on his environment.

- He displayed diagrams and photographs of the project and showed how it (the project) will cause sunlight reduction.
(+) David Teeters – Project Architect
- He displayed diagrams of the site plan and design of the project.
(+) Bill Getty 
- This project will negatively impact his building since it will bock some light and view, and he believes that it will cause parking problems.  Yet he supports the project.

- She has continued to try numerous times to reach the DR requestor and try to reach agreements with her, but to no avail.

- They have had to make many changes to their home because the DR requestor has remodeled her home.
