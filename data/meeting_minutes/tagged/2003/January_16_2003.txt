                    9.           Commission Comments/Questions          
Commissioner W. Lee:   Requested a presentation from Landmarks Board, Mayor's Office of Housing, Mayor's Office of Community Development; Transportation Authority; Redevelopment Agency; Coalition of S.F. Neighbors; S.F. Tomorrow; Mayor's Small Business Commission; Chamber of Commerce, and SPUR
Commissioner S. Lee:  Commented on action taken at last week's meeting (1/9/03) on the Fourth and Freelon Streets Special Use District legislation.  The Commission agreed to endorse the legislation with a number of amendments.  However, they (the Commission) did not receive a copy of the actual legislation with their amendments prior to it being transmitted to the Board of Supervisors.  She requested that, in future, the Director should make sure the Commission also receives a copy of that transmittal.  She thought that the Commission was very clear that they wanted the project to come back to the Commission, in its entirety, as a conditional use.  She would like to see that actual language in the transmittal to the Board and in the legislation.  She has had second thoughts and now feels that the Department should charge fees that are commiserate with a conditional use.  She recalls that there is language in there (the amended legislation) that is less than what is normally charged.  What can the Commission now do if they want to change that?
Commissioner Feldstein:  Also concerned with the language in the final draft of the legislation on the Special Used District forwarded to the Board.  Last week, she specifically wanted to see what they had done in writing, but in the interest of the late hour, we moved on with an oral summary.  She is concerned that the language contained in the preliminary draft of the resolution does not reflect all the changes requested by the commissioners.  She is very uncomfortable that something might be forwarded that is not an accurate reflection.
Commissioner S. Lee:  If legislation comes over from the Board, she feels it is very important that this Commission see any changes in writing before they actually adopt them and they are transmitted to the Board.
Commissioner Antonini:  There are three components to this project--the builder, the recipients of the low cost housing, and the neighborhood.  He feels that there is a tendency on the part of the first two to go with as much height and bulk as possible because the incentives are there.  Whereas the neighborhood would like us to make the project as acceptable as possible in terms of design, setbacks,  and other items.  He has met with members of the Forth Street Neighborhood Association and urged them to get in touch with their Supervisors and try to build flexibility into the legislation that would allow us (the Commission) to have a revenue stream available to make modifications to that building to make it as pleasing as possible who live in the area.  He feels that all have to agree that compromise is necessary here.  It is also very important that since this is the first of what could be many projects of this type, that it not be perceived as some sort of back-room deal and that all parties can try to get something out of this that satisfies them.
          Commissioner Feldstein:  If there is language in the existing draft about a model–that was not part of our (the Commission's) intent last week as she understood it. 
           
C.          DIRECTOR'S REPORT
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
10.          Director's Announcements
-    Responded to Commissioner W. Lee's request regarding scheduling meetings with different City agencies --  1) If you would like to create additional meetings to accomplish this, we can do that.  2) It is very difficult to try to organize this and try to at the same time keep the workload we are currently engaged in.  February 13 is the target date for our budget and maybe these groups can participate as part of that process.  I can't see that discussion taking place without it being linked to resources.  We will try to schedule future presentations without overloading the Commission.
-          Responded to Commissioner S. Lee's concerns regarding the Special Use District legislation.   The Department is given 10 days from the day of the Commission's action to transmit that action to the Clerk of the Board.  The date for this legislation ends on Tuesday.  The resolution with your recommendations has not been transmitted to the Clerk of the Board.  He agrees that Commissioners should be given the opportunity to review their amendments and invited all commissioners to review and get back to him with any matter they feel does not represent the action taken (by the Commission).  However, in order to have another opportunity to effect some change to the legislation you must first rescind your previous action, set a new hearing date, and allow for re-noticing requirements within the 90-day timeline.  (Commissioner Feldstein:  Requested that for this legislation and in the future, the Commission receive any written drafts as soon as they are available.  She expects to have delivered to her for review the draft language to make sure it is an accurate reflection.)  (Commissioner S. Lee:  Asked if it was possible to sever the fee amendment from the draft and restate or come to a different recommendation before transmitting to the Board?)  The Director responded that the City Attorney or Zoning Administrator might want to respond officially, but he felt that the Commission took an action with a vote.  To change that, the Commission would have to rescind that action and schedule another hearing.  Stated that Commissioners could still express to the Supervisors their individual views, and the Department would also communicate to the Board that even after the Commission's action, you re-thought it and would really rather see a full conditional use fee consistent with all other conditional uses.  (Commissioner Feldstein:  Concerned that the draft document transmitted to the Clerk of the Board accurately reflect the actions of the Commission.  She has seen the draft and does not feel that it accurately reflects the actions of the Commission.  It was her understanding that they (the Commission) would see the draft before it was transmitted to the Board in a timely fashion.  If it needs to be delivered to the Clerk by Tuesday, then we need adequate time to review what is quite complex, make sure it's accurate, deliver those comments and have time for those comments to be incorporated, and then see those again to make sure that it is accurate.)  The Director stated that he felt that (this discussion) was going beyond what is permissible for a non-scheduled item.  He stated that he did not believe that the Commission gave clear instruction to forward the draft document to Commissioners for review prior to transmitting to the Clerk of the Board.  He requested that in the future, Commissioners or interested Commissioners should explicitly state that you would like to see the document in a draft form before it is transmitted.  The Department wants the document to accurately reflect what the Commission said.  If you don't believe it reflects that, we can change that.  (Commissioner Antonini:  For clarity – The project will come back to the Commission for design, height and bulk before approval?)  The Director stated that was always part of the legislation and had not changed.  (Commissioner Hughes:  The majority of projects or resolutions that we pass may not rise to the level of complexity as this, and it may not require that we see every resolution prior to it being sent to the Clerk.  But if we do want to see it, I think we should give clear and direct request to have that occur.  I recall the discussion.  But as I recall it, I do not recall a clear request sent to the Director to see that.  In the future, if we do want to see it, we should give explicit instructions or requests.)
-          Announced that the Department will received a grant for $100,000.  The purpose of this grant is to carry out a community based transportation plan for the Glen Park Neighborhood around the BART station.  The source of these funds come from the California Department of Transportation, Bay Area Rapid Transit, as well as the San Francisco Public Library.  The grant requires that we execute a contract with a consultant.  We have prepared a memorandum to you that includes the contract agreements.  The conditions of the funding and the Department's desire is that you (the Commission) play a role in endorsing this before we enter into this contract.  If you have any questions related to this, under Commission Matters you can express them or you can let me know as early as possible.  (Commissioner W. Lee:  Can the work be done in-house instead of contracting it out?)   The document will be in your packet for next week.  Look it over and we will respond to you questions.  My guess to your question however is no.          
-          At last week's meeting, Commission W. Lee requested a status report on several projects that were primarily in the Mayor's Office of Housing.  Also, included in your packets will be the Department's response to the status of each of those projects.

11.          Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
Board of Supervisors (reported by the Director of Planning):
-          Certification of EIR  for the Cruise Terminal was continued for one week.  
-          Appeal of an action taken by the Director of Planning on 10/17/02.  I considered a conditional use authorization to install antennas for Metro PCS at 2444-2454 Noriega St.  I approved the conditional use.  The decision was appealed to the Board of Supervisors and it was continued once to allow the new Supervisor for this District to be sworn in.  At last Monday's meeting, the Board voted 10 to 1 to overturn the Planning Director's decision.
Board of Appeals (reported by the Zoning Administrator):
-          In 2000 the Board of Supervisors added the term  Liquor Store  to neighborhood       commercial.  Prior to that, liquor stores were classified as general retail.  A concern expressed by the Board of Supervisors and the general public about spill-over facts of liquor stores and such.   Our understanding was that there was no accessory use.  Any off-site liquor sales–no matter how little–was a liquor store.  There was a case at 5843 Geary Blvd.  were the Zoning Administrator wrote a determination that adding a very small amount of liquor would not be permitted.  This was appealed to the Board of Appeals  They found in fact that the language did allow accessory use for liquor.
-          1878 Great Highway –  property that had a number of property line windows looking down the Great Highway.  The adjacent property was building up and there was concern about the view.  Board of Appeals upheld the Commission's decision but made modifications to the roof line to allow more air and light.

40-50 LANSING STREET (A.K.A.  35 GUY PLACE) - Appeal of a Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration.  The proposed project involves the construction of a 155,000 gsf, 8-story residential building containing 81 dwelling units with 81 off-street parking spaces on 2 below-grade garage levels and the demolition of the existing 56,250 gsf, 3-story light-industrial building.

The site is within a RC-4 (Residential Commercial Combined, High Density) zoning district, the Rincon Hill Special Use Subdistrict and an 84-X height and bulk district.  The project would require variances from the following provisions of the Planning Code: Freight Loading; dwelling unit exposure; and from the Rincon Hill Special Use District; and Conditional Use authorization for construction of a residential structure over 40 feet tall.

          Preliminary Recommendation:  Approval with conditions
NOTE: On October 17, 2002, the Planning Director continued this matter to November 21, 2002 and requested that the Project Sponsor provide staff with a traffic analysis. 
NOTE: On November 21, 2002, the Planning Commission continued this matter to January 9, 2003.  On January 9, 2003, this matter was continued without further hearing to January 16, 2003.  Public Hearing is open.
          SPEAKER(S):          
          (-)  Renee Saucedo, Project Director for the S.F. Day Labor Program
-          Requested that the Commission follow the recommendations of the Planning Department staff.
-          The proposed use for the Day Labor Program is a needed use for the neighborhood.
-          This project is very realistic and will comply with the conditions set forth by the staff 100%.
-          There is overwhelming support by the immediate neighbors.
(-) Monica Garcia
-          Some neighbors have expressed concerned that the new site is not sufficient or large enough for the Day Labor Program's purposes.  To explain how the site is insufficient, a brief discussion of the program's structure, services and schedule is in order.
-          At its current location with 430 square feet, the program serves between 75-90 people per day, spread over the 6 Â½ hrs that it is open.
-          Program services are mostly on a drop-in bases.  Some people stay for 5 minutes other stay longer.
(-) Bruce Allison
-    This will bring dignity and honor to laborers.  It will also bring down crime and the problem of urination. 
          (-)  Ana Marie Loya,
-          There has been many years of struggles to get this particular site.
-          When the Day Labor Program was founded 13 years ago, there was controversy about where it should be located.  Then it was located at the Franklin Square Park as a temporary site while something better was found.
-          When we adopted this program, about two or three years ago, the program was still located in those trailers.  By this time, the trailers were dilapidated and falling apart.  We were told by the Board of Supervisors and the Mayor's Office that a priority for us was to find a new site.
          (-) Sandra Bivanco
-          Asked Commission to keep in mind that the proposed new home for the Day Labor Program is about providing dignity to hard working people of our community.
          (-)  Tito Mendoza
-          Supports the Day Labor Program.  It has helped him and his colleague obtain jobs.
(-)   Larry Collins, Property Manager at 3358 Cesar Chavez
-          The owner of our building and all three tenants who lived there support this program.
(-)   Martin Rodriguez
-          Asked the Commission to grant the permit to do the repairs to the building.
-          Trailers that are occupied right now are very uncomfortable.
-          We are here to continue struggling for what the workers need to survive.
(-)    Maria  Rodriguez
-          Day Labor Program should be granted the building on Cesar Chavez.
-          This will be of great benefit for them.
-          The workers would be able to support their families.  They would have more stability and a safe place where they obtain more jobs
-          It is not going be prejudicial to anyone.  To the contrary, everybody will benefit.
(-)  G. W. Frederick
-          I had employed several people from the program for about 12 years.
-          It is not very dignified for people to have to be house in the kind of situation that exists in the trailers.
(-)   Teresa Molina
-          I am here to support the program.  I feel that it is very important for them to have that building so they can have a safe place and obtain their jobs without being out on the streets.
(-)  Francisco Herrera
-          Worked for the labor program for the last 13 years.
-          At Saint Anthony's Church there is a group of 6 ladies, who prepare food for the laborers every day.
-          We have the support of most of the churches in the neighborhood.
-          Urged the Commission to approve the use of the building.
(-)   Lina Ramirez
-          The workers deserve a dignified place to work.
(-)   Laurie McKenzie
-          Supports this program.
(-)  Mauricio Vela,  Executive Director of Bernal Heights Neighborhood Center
-          Has lived in the neighborhood for 45 years.
-          Expressed his support as well as that of the Neighborhood Center for the San Francisco Labor Day Program.
(-)   Francisco Martin del Campo
-          Strongly supports the Day Labor Program moving to this site.
(-)   Luis Granados
-          This kind of use on Cesar Chavez is the proper use.  There are no planning issues to be discuss.
-          If this were any other project, or if this building would serve any other contingency, it would have been approved.
(-)  Joe Triguero
-          Asked the Commission to push this project forward and not allow anybody to sidetrack them from making the positive decision for the Day Labor Program.
(-)   Eric Quezada
-          After 20 years of not being located at the source, this project will help and improve the situation.
(-)   Antonio Diaz, Director of Poder
-          Our organization strongly support this project.
(-)   Jason Alexander
-          Giving the Labor Program this building is a great idea.
-          Urged the Commission to approve this project.
(-)    Dr. Bahia Batia, Department of Public Health
-          The move to Cesar Chavez will enhance health in the following ways: 1) will increase worker accessibility to health services; 2) it will improve the safety conditions of the workers; 3) it will improve pedestrian safety; 4) it will improve public sanitation; and 5) it will decrease the risk of violence to labors resulting from robberies.
(-)   Sister Ann Marie Sullivan
-          Supports this project.
(-)   Hector Valdez
-          I think it is only fair that there will an office on Cesar Chavez Street for the Day Labor Program because that has been their dream for many years.
(-)  Eduardo Palomo
-          As a staff member of the Day Labor Program, I feel that it is very important for us to have an office on Cesar Chavez where we can render the services. This will be beneficial not only for the workers, but for the neighbors.
(-)   Ellie Kugler
-          Urged the Commission to approve the project.
(-)  Iris Biblowitz
-    Supports the project whole heartedly.
(-)  Supervisor Chris Daly
-          Before becoming a Supervisor in San Francisco, he served on the Advisory Committee to the Day Labor Program. 
-          Day Laborers have really been doing the work for the rest of us in San Francisco, with the population that really struggles to make ends meet
-          When we talk about poor people in San Francisco,  we talk about poor Latino people specifically.  They make up the majority of the day laborers and they would benefit from this new center.  We talk about a population that is definitely under served.  We talk about a group of people, although they work incredible hard, very rarely get many of the advantages many of us take for granted here in San Francisco.
-          For probably ten years,  this is a program, the Day Labor Program are a group of people, that had political problems in front of them.  People who had been seen by others, who has more, people who are undesirable in the neighborhood
-          Currently they are operating out of trailers.  Day Labor Program can no provide the services, can not provide the access that really the labors deserve in San Francisco.  
-          Day Laborers deserve this center.  This center proposed in any neighborhood in San Francisco would probably come with some neighborhood opposition.  
-          Urged the Commission to favorably consider this project.  Do your best for the entire City and County of San Francisco--in this case, the City of Saint Francis--where we have open arms. We are a city of refuge.  We are known to do what we can to give the underdog any advantage, or any opportunity we can.
(-)  Steve Williams
-          It is crucial that this Commission vote yes in favor of this proposal for the safety and dignity of the day labors.
(-)   Mariana Biturro
-          The workers need a dignified place.  There have been too many years that the City has been denying them the right to have their own space on Cesar Chavez.
(-)   Jill Shanker
-          Please grant the workers a dignified place.
(-)   Brooke Atherton
-          The proposed use for the Day Labor Program is a permitted used in the neighborhood.
-          An independent traffic consultant anticipated no increase in traffic caused by the programs move to the new building.
(-)   Paul Moore
-          In his opinion, this debate should be about how to provide justice and humane working conditions for workers.
(-)   Maria Marroquin
-          Respectfully requested that the Planning Commission not to delay  the project and approve the permit.
(-)  David Corona
-          In the name of  my co-workers, I want to remind you that all of us are going   to benefit.
(-)  Supervisor Tom Ammiano
-          Expressed his support for this project. 
-          This program is in his district--district 9--and is not without controversy, but he very much supports it.
-          What is an appropriate site?  Sometimes what is appropriate is in the mind or  eyes of the beholder.  And sometimes those situations change on a daily basis.
-          I have read the report and believe this will be an appropriate site.
(-)   Toby Levine
-          She would like to see this Commission vote in favor that the program and have it established at this site.
(-)   Rosabella Safron
-          There are a lot of political issues surrounding this project.  But the issue that we are here today to discuss is whether this is an appropriate site for the Day Labor Program?  
-          She urged the Commission to look at the fact that traffic congestion is a non-issue.  Once the laborers are at the site, it will do a lot to alleviate the traffic problem.  The current traffic problems are not caused solely because of the day labors.  They are caused by speeders and by all kinds of issues that have nothing to do with the labors.
(-)   Andre Rocker
-          Supports the project.
(-)   Joaquin Gutierrez
-          Us laborers do not have support from the Police.  That causes a lot of problems with the neighbors. The solution is to grant us the permit to occupy the building on Cesar Chavez.
(-) Philip Chew
-          The Day Labor Program is a good program that benefits not only the Mission community, but also the City and County of San Francisco at large.
(-)   Richard Marquez, Mission Agenda
-          Finally,  today, the voices of the excluded are being heard.
-          Give the Day Labor Program the site that they deserve.
(-)   Julio Loyola
-          I am here to ask you to grant permission for the building.
(-)  Nora Calderon
-          Supports the project.
(-)  Carlos Mares
-          Asked the Commission to grant the petition to the Day Labor Program.
(-)  Jane Morrison
-          Let's treat the labors with respect.  Cesar Chavez is a good location.
(-)   Judy Rebord
-          I have lived in the neighborhood for the last five years and would like to welcome the Day Labor Program to my community.
(-)   Howard Wallace
-          He spoke in support of the project.
(-)   Jeff Jankito
-          He supports the project.
(-)   Charlie Shamus
-          Supports day laborers in their struggle to earn a living wage; to seek work free of harassment; to build the day labor program that provides comprehensive job referral services; and to have a secure funded site at 3358 Cesar Chavez Street.
-          The City has wasted too much time by not approving this permit--and this is precious time that has been taken away from more important tasks, such as, building a strong network of services to support the workers and enforcing their rights.
(-)   Mr. Radney
-           Most of the neighbors around this site are supporting this project.
(-)   Juanita Brown
-          In strong support of the site.
-          The issue is not whether or not the day labors need to be present--their presence is a reality.
-          The proposed site is a viable organized way of honoring and acknowledging the work that they do and their presence.
(-)   Paulette Budro
-          Supports this program
(-)  Hector Molina
-          As a day laborer I am here to let you know that we have been asking the City for a long time to provide us with some bathrooms.  We have also petitioned the Police to not harass us.  We are just people who stand there everyday trying to get a job.
(-)  Jennifer Fridenbach
-          Supports day labors whole heartedly and welcome them with open arms.
-          The program will be an excellent addition to the neighborhood.
(-)   Gloria Estevan
-          I am in favor of the workers obtaining their own building.
(-)   Maira Rera
-          Strongly supports the move of the labor program to its new location.
(-)   Refugio Lopez
-          What we are asking, is very little.  Please, approve the permit so we can continue supporting our families.
(-)          Miguel Carrera
-          It is important that the workers have a bathroom.  Basic needs are not being met.
-          Because the workers basic needs are not being met, it is very important for you to be determined to solve this issue.
(-)   Jon Lowitz
-          Supports the Day Labor Program.
(-)   Eddy Chan
-          The Day Labor Program is part of the community development in the Mission District.
(-)   Carmelo Diaz
-          Supports the program, and asked the Commission to give them a hand, with the approval.
(-)   Christina Loggi
-          Hoped that the Commission will vote in favor for the Day Labor Program, so the workers can have a decent place.
(+)  Jamie Roth
-          The traffic reports in the Discretionary Review are flawed.
-          This project will affect the conditions on Cesar Chavez Street.
-          This place is too small to accommodate 20 of 30 people comfortably.
-          There will be traffic accidents, pedestrian blockage, and there will be additional stress to the huge budget cuts on City services that are already stretched to the limit.
-          The conditions that the Planning Department is recommending are unenforceable and they will be ignored by the Centro La Raza.
(+)  Captain Greg Shur (last name unclear)
-          Responded to different concerns expressed by Planning Commissioners.
(+) Neil Sthaling
-          Concerned about the independent consulting methodology for calculating expected  trip generation–believes it is fundamentally flawed.
(+)   John Wilson
-          Traffic options are not really bearing on the issue of  the location.
-          This site will increase the accessibility and participation by day labors.  It will only be appropriate to say that if, in fact, the day labors can come into the site.
(+) Howard Gastad
-          I believe the community at large really supports better conditions for day labors and good hiring hall.  This is not it.
(+)  Rafael Franco
-          He does not agree that the building on Cesar  Chavez should be given to the staff of  La Raza Legal Center.
(+) Eva Soltes
-          Requested that the Commission give the workers a decent place to be. 
(+)  Julia Ramachiote
-          The site is extremely small to accommodate all the workers and give the services that they are planning to provide them.
(+)   Craig Weber
-          Expressed his strong opposition on this project
-          Stated that the conditions of approval are unenforceable.  They lack clarity and purpose and they are impossible to implement.
(+)  Al Lopez
-          You can not put all these people into that tiny place and expect them to have the quality (of life) that we all expect to have in our community.
-          There are a lot of empty buildings in other areas, why do we want to have 500 people overcrowd in the neighborhood?
(+) Kathy Ramiachiote
-          The site is inadequate.  It is a health hazard for these men.
(+)   Christine Pascual
-          Feels that the site is very small  to be used as a large institution or a hiring hall.
-          Concerned about traffic and parking issues.
(+)  Laura Muniz
-          Opposed the 3358 Cesar Chavez Street as a hiring hall proposed 
-          This will institutionalize the existing practice of using the street of this neighborhood as a hiring hall.
(+)  Maria Leon
-          Concerned about traffic hazards and pedestrian safety.
(+)  Jose Muniz
-          This location is too small and the practice of chasing after vehicles to get a job will continue.
(+) John Barbey
-          This is not a hiring hall, it is a tiny office.
-          Workers need something better than this.  It is a shame that the City cannot provide something better for them.
(+) Chris Saver
-          Does not support this project.
(+)  Pat Delgado
-           This is not a race issue.  It is very important that we all remember that this is a building that is a totally inadequate site for working conditions.
-           It does not provide shelter during inclement weather.  It does not provide bathrooms.  It does not provide areas for services that are needed in all areas.  It does seriously affect the quality of life in the Mission District.
(+)  Milt Gaines (read a letter from Jane and Ed Perry)
-          The Perry's oppose the proposed project.
(+)  Roxane Melik
-          As an architect, she believes that the scale of the project seems very disconnected with its intended purpose.
(+)  Judy Berkowitz
-          There is overwhelming opposition to this project in the neighborhood.
-          All surrounding business are against the location of the Day Labor Program at this site.
-          Asked the Commission to deny the permit.
(+)  Rolandid Limas
-          Not in favor of this project.
(+)  Arturo Rodriguez
-          Strongly opposes the approval of this project.
(+)  Mauricio Avilez
-          Is opposed to this project.
(+)   Dendraco Zelaya
-          As far as he is concerned, the proposed site is too small.
(+) Pedro Rosas
-          I am opposed to the project.
(+) Joe Porcoro
-          Requested that the Commission deny the permit.
(+) Michael Quintana
-          This site is not appropriate for the large number of workers. 
(+) Julio Arrendodo
-          Is opposed to giving Centro Legal La Raza the permit to have 3358 Cesar Chavez as a hiring hall.
(+)  Salomon Jimenez
-          Against granting the permit for this building, because it is too small.
(+)  Babette Drefky
-          The hiring hall should be placed at another site.
(+) Eric Arguello
-          I support the program, but I am against the proposed site because it is extremely small.
