B. COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
5.  Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner Feldstein:


- She apologized to the public for not having her responses submitted regarding the Housing Element.  There was a death in her family recently and she is just getting caught up with her work load.


Commissioner Bill Lee:


Re:  Housing Element


- He previously had requested information from staff regarding overlays of the existing zoning for housing in the city with an overlay of supervisor Peskin's proposal for secondary units, another overlay regarding the Better Neighborhoods Program and the zoning for housing, and finally the fourth overlay would be the latest draft of the Planning Department's Housing Element.  He would like to have this information before he makes a final decision.  There is a public hearing on July 21 and he would like to have the priorities of the other City Departments such as the Transportation Authority, etc.


Commissioner Antonini:


Re:  Housing Element


- He echoed what Commission Bill Lee mentioned and would like to see this information in a separate session other than when the Housing Element hearing will take place.


C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
6. Director's Announcements


Re:  Commissioner Bill Lee's Comments:


- He does not believe that all comments form Commissioners have been received.


- Although there is an intent to have a hard copy and an electronic copy, the electronic copy might not be available at the same time as the hard copy.


- There were agencies who gave presentations and he thought that they informed the Commission about their overlays.


- Staff will be able to provide Commissioner Bill Lee with the graphic information about the linkages to the Eastern Neighborhoods and the Rezoning Efforts as well as all the pieces of information.


Re:  Budget Hearing


- During the hearing of June 26, he presented to the Commission the recommendations from the Budget Analyst to the Board of Supervisors.  Later that evening he was not able to give his presentation before the Budget Committee.  The hearing actually took place the next day on Friday.  At that time, he was able to respond to the Budget Analyst's recommendations.  The Budget Analyst made several recommendations to delete several vacant positions, eliminate the budget for equipment, and eliminate a position where there is an individual on that requisition.


- He went before the budget committee and supported some and disagreed with some.


- The final result was the following:
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
1. Delete three Planner II positions that are currently vacant.
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
2. Delete a Senior Clerk Typist and a Senior Manager Position which are currently vacant.
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
3. Reclassify a vacant Planner IV position to a Planner III position.
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
4. Delete the $50,000 which would have been devoted to laptop equipment.
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
5. Vehicles assigned on a full time basis to him and the Zoning Administrator are to be re-assigned for staff use.  These vehicles are used by staff anyway so this would not change much.
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
6. Delete a Planner V position in the Information Services Unit.  This position is currently filled so the consequence would be that those who are the least senior in this classification would be affected.  In this case, that would be the Environmental Review Officer.  The person in this position has very special qualifications and experience regarding CEQA.  A reassignment would really undermine the ability of the department to be efficient.  He will submit an alternative that would be a refinement of their actions.


SPEAKER(S):


Marilyn Amini


- She would like to know the availability of Commissioner's comments regarding the Housing Element.


- She would also like to know what is the procedure of the "Third draft" of the Housing Element.

7. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals


BOS - 


- Due to the July 4 holiday, neither the Land Use Committee nor the Board met the week of June 30, 2003.


Land Use Committee Meeting of July 7, 2003:


- Consideration of Supervisor Peskin's ordinance establishing the Jackson Square Special Use District.  "In order to provide for the protection and enhancement of specialty retail and antique store uses in the Jackson Square area."


- This legislation was amended to exempt all uses that front Pacific Street.


- Passed out to the Full Board for action.


Full Board of Supervisor's Meeting of July 8, 2003:


Re:  948-950 Lombard Street


- The appeal was tabled off the Department's Categorical Exemption from environmental review.  Staff has rescinded the exemption determination after receiving new geotechnical information and are re-evaluating the environmental determination.


Land Use Committee Meeting of July 14, 2003:


- The committee will consider Supervisor Gonzalez's legislation proposing neighborhood noticing for Retail Coffee Store and Pharmaceutical and personal toiletries (i.e. drugstore) uses. Recommended unanimously by the Commission on June 5.


- Hearing to consider the priorities of City Planning and its work program for the upcoming fiscal year.  McGoldrick sponsored this hearing to discuss the Department's priories as it relates to the annual budget.


Full Board of Supervisor's Meeting of July 15, 2003:


- Appeal of the secondary unit environmental exemption.


- Conditional Use Appeal of 270-284 Valencia Street.


BOA - 


Re:  330 25
th
 Avenue


- This was a demolition and new construction.  The Commission did not take Discretionary Review on either demolition or new construction.


- The Board upheld (+5-0) the Commission's decision except that a four foot corner of the proposed project should be cut out. 


Re:  1349 Clayton Street


- This property was listed in the preservation listing.


- The steel windows needed to be replaced with vinyl windows.  The department did not approve vinyl windows on a preservation category building.


- The owner installed the windows without a permit.  An enforcement action was taken.


- The building permit was ultimately submitted, the department disapproved it.  


- This went before the Board of Appeals, the department was upheld on a +4-1 vote.


- The project sponsor requested a rehearing but did not show up.  The Zoning Administrator was upheld.


- The Board decided to grant another hearing.  There was a decision at the call of the chair to install strips to give the illusion of cottage windows.


- This disturbs him (the ZA) and he will be looking at this further.


D. PUBLIC COMMENT ON AGENDA ITEMS WHERE THE PUBLIC HEARING HAS BEEN CLOSED


At this time, members of the public who wish to address the Commission on agenda items that have already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the public hearing has been closed, must do so at this time.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.


Re:  4
th
 and Freelon


(+/-) Christine Koncal


- She would like the Commission to consider lowering the building.


- There are various projects that have underground parking and some are even closer to the San Francisco shoreline.


- The cost for this building has not been substantiated.


- The developer has received a height limit gift.


- The SOMA master plan has certain codes, especially on alleys, that this has disregarded.


(-) Elizabeth Dodd


- She read a letter from Chris Slattery who lives close to the 4
th
 and Freelon project.


- The quality of air in the area where this project will be built is the worst 2
nd
 highest in the City.


- There is a report from the Department of Public Health that gives this same report.


- Protection is needed here more than anywhere in the City.


(-) Robert Scott


- This developer has been given an excess in height to his benefit, yet still cannot provide a code-complying building.


- This is a residential building that does not have residential requirements.


- The developer has "tied" the architect's hands.


- This project will not provide the best allowable space.


(-) John Carney


- He has looked at the exceptions and they are still not strong enough.


- The height has not been straightened out.  Low cost housing is still not clear either.


- There is no mention about the garage.


- Smoke stacks should be installed because of the problems with the air quality.


- It is a real fraud to put a 9-story building where there is none.


(-) Kenton McSween


- He is here as a concerned neighbor and architect.


- He is concerned with the overall height of the building.


- There should be units on the bottom floors to deal with security issues.


- There are various projects in this area that have underground parking.


- He would like the Commission to deny this project as it is currently proposed.


(-) Dick Millet


- He is having a big problem with this project.


- It seems that everything has become "let's make a deal."  The developer should be ashamed to have a project here 


(-) Mary Ann Miller


- The additional height is designed to just affect one lot.


- The Commission cannot set aside all the requirements to make a place livable.


(-) Sue Hestor


- There seems to be private guarantees and nothing is certain.


- A lot of people have understood different things about what is proposed.


(+) Joe O'Donaghue


- He cannot believe that the public is here again after there has been hearing, after hearing, after hearing.


- This Commission should be proud of what they have done so far.


- This project simply proves that a job can be done with so many obstacles.

Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions


(Continued from Regular Meeting of June 19, 2003)


NOTE:
 On June 19, 2003, following public testimony, the Commission closed public hearing and continued the matter to July 10, 2003 by a vote +4 -2.  Commissioners Boyd and Antonini voted no.  Commissioner William Lee was absent.


SPEAKER(S): None


ACTION: Approved as amended:  


1) findings relating to the use of prevailing wages; 2) findings and conditions of approval relating to air quality issues presented by the adjacent auto-oriented use as well as financial responsibility for any required improvements to air handing equipment; 3) findings relating to impacts of the high water table on the feasibility of excavation; 4) findings and conditions of approval relating to the "un-bundling" of parking; 5) conditions of approval relating to site control for the companion affordable project prior to permit issuance; 6) conditions of approval relating to design detail for (a) the blank wall facing Zoe Street and (b) an enhanced visual connection between Zoe Street and the fourth level courtyard; 7) staff to continue to work with the applicant to improve the proposed ground level conditions along Freelon and Welsh Streets (four additional dwelling units, two each along the ground level frontages of Freelon and Welsh Streets to be established.  These units would contain approximately 500 square feet and would feature direct street access); 8) the total number of units would increase to 300 while the total number of off-street parking spaces would decrease to a maximum of 307; (the topography of the site is such that the inclusion of these units may require an increase in the overall height of the building by up to 18 inches for a total height of no more than 85 feet).

CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES  PROJECT
 - 
Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR)
 - The California Academy of Sciences is in Golden Gate Park (Lot 1 of Assessor's Block 1700) along the easterly edge of the Music Concourse within a P (Public Use) district and an OS (Open Space) Height and Bulk District.  The project would be to build a new CAS on the site of the existing facilities.  The project would include demolition of 11 of the existing 12 buildings, and the removal of approximately 73 existing parking spaces.  The project would retain and rehabilitate Simson African Hall in place.  The Academy would retain its general location and orientation.  The new facility would include three main levels above grade, two levels below grade, and a loading area at the southwestern portion of the project site.  The new Academy building would be approximately 460 feet long and 280 feet wide, with the edges of the roof extending to approximately 520 feet long by 335 feet wide.  The building would feature a landscaped roof, the base height of which would be less than 40 feet.  Above the base, the landscaped roof would undulate to accommodate the Academy's major programmatic components beneath, with the two peak elements over the planetarium and rainforest exhibits reaching a height of about 67 feet, or approximately 13 feet beyond the highest existing point (Morrison Planetarium).  These two peaks would be set back approximately 150 feet from the roof's edge along Academy Drive.  Trellised portions of the roof would extend beyond the perimeter walls.  The floor area would increase from approximately 350,000 sq. ft. to approximately 390,000 sq. ft.  The footprint would decrease from approximately 240,000 sq. ft. to approximately 205,500 sq. ft.  This increase in area on a smaller footprint is possible because the plans significantly increase basement level areas. 


Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the EIR as a Final EIR.  Please note the public review period for the DEIR ended at 5:00 pm, April 29, 2003.


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Ron Miguel - PAR


- This is one of the smallest compendium of responses to the EIR.  It is adequate, comprehensive, and especially complete.


(+) Jim Chappell - President of SPUR


- There is no question that this EIR is adequate and complete and should be certified.


- This is a dream project.


(-) Chris Dudlestadt - SFT


- There are a lot of errors and omissions in this project.


- There are a lot of important accesses for the public that will be removed.  These are significant to the project.


(-) Mary Ann Miller - Alliance for Golden Gate Park


- This was supposed to be a series of EIR's and it has not been so.


- The public does not know what they will get.


- She hopes that the Commission combines a hearing for this EIR and for the garage.


(-) Stephen Willis - Alliance for Golden Gate Park


- He is upset that there is only 1 minute of testimony.


- This is the perfect example of fraud.


(+) Tai Via

491 BAYSHORE BOULEVARD - HOME DEPOT PROJECT
 - 
Public Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Report
 - The proposed project consists of demolition of two vacant buildings, totaling 107,346 square feet (sq.ft.), and construction of a home improvement store (Home Depot). The 153,089-sq.ft.-project would consist of a two-story main store with approximately 96,250 sq.ft. on the main floor, 38,405 sq.ft. on the second floor, a 9,888-sq.-ft. enclosed greenhouse and an approximately 8,546-sq.ft. outdoor-garden center. A separate parking garage consisting of two levels plus rooftop parking totaling 550 parking spaces would also be constructed on this 5.73-acre site. The buildings would be approximately 40 feet in height. Vehicular access to the parking garage would be from Bayshore Boulevard, where Cortland Avenue dead-ends into Bayshore Boulevard, and secondary access would be on Loomis and Waterloo Streets. A customer pick-up lane would be provided on the ground level of the parking facility with egress onto Bayshore Boulevard, just north of the Cortland Avenue intersection. Four freight-loading spaces would be provided. The project is located within the Bayview/Hunters Point neighborhood. The site is within the Planning Commission's adopted Industrial`` Protection Zone (IPZ) and is located in a M-1 (Light Industrial) zoning district and within a 65-J height and bulk district.


Preliminary Recommendation:  No Action Required.  Public hearing to receive comments only.


Note:  Written comments will be received at the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m., on July 11, 2003.
