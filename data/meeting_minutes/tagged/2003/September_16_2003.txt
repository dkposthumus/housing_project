MID MARKET REDEVELOPMENT PLAN
 - CERTIFICATION OF THE FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT. The Redevelopment Agency of the City and County  of San Francisco (SFRA) proposes the Mid-Market Redevelopment Plan for the Mid-Market Project Area, located in downtown San Francisco, generally from Fifth Street to Tenth Street along the Market and Mission Streets corridor.  The Project Area encompasses 14 Assessor's Blocks in portion or in entirety: 341, 342, 350, 355 (North of Market), 3507, 3508, 3509, 3701, 3702, 3703, 3704, 3725, 3727, and 3728 (South of Market). A Mid-Market Special Use District would also include A/B 351 (North of Market). The Mid-Market Plan would authorize the SFRA to participate in certain projects and programs to help alleviate blighting conditions in the project area.  Plan implementation would include about 5,970,000 square feet of new and rehabilitated space: including about 2,890,000 square feet of housing, 1,200,000 square feet of office space, 548,000 square feet of parking, 106,000 square feet of institutional space, 394,000 square feet of retail space, 385,000 square feet of hotel use, and 351,500 square feet of theater and art space. The overall development assumed in the Mid-Market Plan would occur over a 30-year time period. The EIR analyzes overall changes in land use in the Project Area for the year 2020.  It does not assume detailed plans for specific development sites.
