7. Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner William Lee:


Re: Exactions


- Requested from staff or the City Attorney's office a list of what exactions from the present Planning Code the Commission is allowed for any type of commercial development, etc.


- He wants to know what people are paying now for open space, childcare, into MUNI, etc.


Re: Residential Design Guidelines


He received a draft report dated July 7 from the AIA regarding the Residential Design Guidelines.  A copy was sent to Max Putra.  He requested that these guidelines be included when the Commission discusses the final Residential Design Guidelines standards.


Re: Performance Measures for the Planning Department


- Get some indicators that are common throughout all City Planning departments in the United Sates so the department can judge themselves on the time it takes for an application to come in, using whatever the criteria is, to the time it gets to the Commission.


Commissioner Hughes:


Re: Robert McDonald


- This morning there was a memorial service for Robert McDonald.


- Mr. McDonald was a representative for Labor's Local 261.  He sat on the Golden Gate Bridge District Board of Directors and was active in civic activities for many years.


- He requested that we adjourn today in memory of Robert McDonald.


Commissioner Antonini:


Re:  Affordable Housing


- He had made a request for an update/briefing on affordable housing.


- He requested that this item be scheduled on an agenda before the Commission considers the Housing Element because it is a key feature.


Commissioner Boyd:


Re:  Inclusionary housing provisions


- Could there be some delineation of the number of units that have been actually approved and their location across the City?


- He would like staff to keep track of where the inclusionary housing is being built.


Commissioner Feldstein:


Re:  Inclusionary Housing 


- The Nonprofit Housing Association of Northern California has recently released a study of inclusionary policies throughout California.  It is more up to date than the Sedway Report and it is more inclusive since it has more jurisdictions.  It would be helpful if this information could be made available to the Commission.


C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
8. Director's Announcements


Re:  Commissioner William Lee's Comments


Re: Exactions


- In the C-3 Districts (the downtown districts), primarily for office, a number of exactions are collected.


- Open space is $2.00 per square foot to build a major downtown park and there has been a lot of money collected on this but most of the money went to the improvement of Union Square.  There is a $1.00 per square foot fee for childcare or the project can provide childcare on site.  Most projects have paid the fee.


- In a larger area than downtown there is a fee called "TIDF" (Transit Impact Development Fee).  This covers East of Van Ness Avenue.  This is $5.00 per square foot.


- There is the inclusionary housing ordinance which was adopted by the Commission and passed by the Board of Supervisors.  This depends on what the use is.  Office is one fee, Retail/Entertainment, Industrial, and it varies with the different uses.  The housing fee is up to $16.00 per square foot.  In the C-3 districts there is also a fee of 1% for art.   The Unified School District charges a fee for housing units.  This is the only housing fee that is not actually charged by the City or the Department but from the Unified School District which is another department.


Re: Performance Measures for the Planning Department


- He will try to get this information but he does not think there are any cities that are comparable to San Francisco.


Response to Commissioner Antonini's Comments:


- The Housing Element will be heard on October 9.  It would be appropriate to have a discussion on affordable housing on this date.


Response to Commissioner Boyd:


Re:  Number of units approved under Inclusionary Housing.


- In many cases, projects have not broken ground so the project sponsors have not had to commit yet if they will include the units within the project or do offsite.  


- Most projects are doing onsite affordable housing.  Few projects are taking advantage of the offsite.


Response to Commissioner Feldstein:


- He will get the Non Profit Association of Northern California report and provide a copy to the Commission.

201 FOLSOM STREET
 - 
Certification of Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) - 
The rezoning of parcels in the Rincon Hill neighborhood (the "rezoning project") and a residential development of approximately 1,500,000 gross square feet (gsf) at 201 Folsom Street (the "development" project).  The property is currently used as a paved parking lot by the United States Postal Service (USPS) Annex and other government agencies for 270 vehicles.  The rezoning project includes rezoning part of Lot 1 in Assessor's Block 3746 and Lots 1 and 8 in Assessor's Block 3745 from the existing P (Public) to a zoning district that allows private development.  The requested rezoning is from P (Public) with height limits of 150 and 200 feet to RC-4 (Residential-Commercial Combined: High-Density) with a 300- and 400-foot height limit.  In addition, a Planning Code text amendment is requested to create a new Residential/Commercial sub-district under the Rincon Hill Special Use District overlay, and amendments to the 
Rincon Hill Area Plan
, a part of the 
San Francisco General Plan
.  The request for rezoning has been made in conjunction with development proposed at 300 Spear Street on Assessor's Block 3745, Lot 1, that would be a part of the rezoned area.  The third parcel requested to be rezoned is 345 Main Street, Lot 8 in Assessor's Block 3745, the remaining privately owned lot in the existing P district. The development portion of the project would consist of up to 725 residential units (about 825,000 gsf) and about 38,000 gsf of retail space.  It would include about 753 enclosed parking spaces and four loading spaces for the use of the development, and about 272 enclosed replacement parking spaces for the use of the USPS and other government agencies.  An 80-foot-tall building base would cover the site.  Two residential towers would rise above the building base to total heights of approximately 350 feet and 400 feet above the ground level.  The project would require a subdivision of Lot 1 to separate the development site from the Postal Service Annex.

However, due to a prior Planning Commission action and approved Motion No. 16084 for case no 2000.0385C the site had been deemed a Preference 6.  The Planning Commission will consider under which Preference (2 or 6) to review the application.

Kirk Scott


Re:  Discretionary Reviews


- He is not a developer but he has been stuck in the Discretionary Review process as well as the Board of Permit Appeals process for two years trying to get a building permit.


- It is a very simple project.  The previous Planning Commission modified the project but the neighbors were not satisfied with that result and they brought him before the current Planning Commission and now to the Board of Permit Appeals.


- Any kind of delay costs thousands of dollars.  This has been very disruptive to his family.


- He had made all sorts of plans but has not been able to see them through.


- It is getting to the point that he will have to accept the changes his neighbors want.


- He feels that he has been put on trial three times for a simple building permit.


- He wanted to expose these comments and concerns to the Commission before discussing Discretionary Review reforms next week.
