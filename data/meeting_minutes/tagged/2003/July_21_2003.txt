- Affordable housing is a blessing.


- People are homeless for different reasons yet most of them live this way because housing is not affordable.


Francisco Centurion - Russian Hill Neighbors


- He thinks that there are a lot of things that are too loose.  Until they are resolved there is no housing element.

- He is concerned about the transit corridors (Van Ness, Geary, Mission, etc).

Eileen Bogan - SPEAK

She would like to see more explicit wording around the incentives for private developers to include affordable housing ownership units in their private developments for the 80% to 120% median income families.  That would free up the public funds to target the low income family needs.


- The needs assessment of the Housing Element gives very explicit wording around facilitating the permit process for private developers who do include affordable housing.
