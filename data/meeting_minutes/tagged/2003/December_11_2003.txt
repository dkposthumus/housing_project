 - a cul-de-sac on the north side of Leavenworth Street between Greenwich and Lombard Streets; Lot 025 in Assessor's Block 0071  - Request for Variance from the rear yard requirements of the Planning Code to construct a single-family dwelling partially into the required rear yard, within an RH-3 (Residential, House, Three-family) District, and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.  Section 134 of the Planning Code states that in an RH-3 District, in the case of any lot that abuts along both its side lot lines upon lots with buildings that front on another street or alley, the minimum rear yard depth shall be 25 percent of the total depth of the lot, or 15 feet, whichever is greater.  On the approximately 80-foot deep subject lot, this results in a rear yard requirement of 20 feet, with the south side of the lot being considered the rear.  The proposed construction would project into the required rear yard by up to 11 feet at the ground (garage) floor level, extending to within 9 feet of the south property line.  The application requesting a Variance will be heard by the Zoning Administrator.

8. Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner Hughes:


Re: Discretionary Review Policy Revisions


- These revisions are tentatively scheduled for next week and he wondered if the revisions are ready.


- He suggested that the date be moved since in the event that the draft is circulated three or four days prior to the date of the hearing, he feels that there will be a room full of people that say that they have not had enough time to look over the information.  In order to avoid that, he suggests that that item be moved.


Commissioner Antonini:


Re:  Ballot Measure


- There is a ballot measure that will be coming up in the March, 2004 primary election that has to do with work force housing.  He is not sure if it is called Prop G or H.  Questions have arisen from the public regarding this that would allow it to take place without going through the planning process and he is not sure why.  He requested that the Acting Director discuss this.


Commissioner Bill Lee:


Re:  Entertainment Commission


- He requested that the Planning Department work with the Entertainment Commission regarding rules and regulations that would affect any type of entertainment permits that the Entertainment Commission staff would approve.

9.  
ALTERNATING CASE TYPES
 - In September, 2003, the Commission instituted a policy, on a trial basis, to alter how project types were to be scheduled on their public hearing calendars.  At that time, it was felt that with all case types on the same calendar, some were being heard consistently while others  were being continued consistently.  In an attempt to address this, it was established that case types would be alternated with Discretionary Review (DR) cases scheduled on one hearing day and other non DR cases on an alternate hearing day.  
At this time, the Commission would like to discuss the effectiveness of alternating case type schedules, and consider maintaining it, modifying it, or abolishing it.


SPEAKER(S):


Larry Paul - Architect


- He is also a Planning Commissioner for the City of San Rafael.


- He suggested to have an accessory design review board/panel that would consist of neutral architects;


- Or have the City organize a design review board that would make recommendations.


- This would decrease some of the case loads.


Steve Currier - Outer Mission Residents Association


- He agrees with Commissioner Sue Lee's comments about getting comments from the public on this.


- One of the reasons that the calendar is the way it is now is because the Commission was not in session for several months.  This caused a back log.


- He feels that this back log is a hardship on the homeowners.


- Having a mixed calendar is a blessing.


Commission Secretary (Comments from Ms. Sue Hestor):


- She (Ms. Hestor) does not agree with the alternating schedule;


- Materials do not get into the packets early enough, which is a hardship on the public.


- This item should have been noticed with more time in advance so that the public could comment.


Elaine Tope - Staff Planner


- She has worked with design boards and feels that this is a way to settle various design issues for projects and not have them come before the Commission.


- It is not important to her if the calendar is mixed or alternated.


ACTION: Continue the alternating schedule subject to review again in approximately 60 days or upon receipt of staff's recommendations to changes in the Discretionary Review process or adoption of policies related to administrative review of the Discretionary Review process.


AYES: Antonini, Bradford Bell, Boyd, Feldstein, Hughes, S. Lee, W. Lee


C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT

<<Project Start>>
10. Director's Announcements


Re:  Housing Element


- The Commission directed staff to begin the environmental review process.  A negative declaration will be issued within the next couple of weeks.  The appeal period will be extended because of the holidays.


Re:  Rincon Hill Plan


- Included in the presentation last week was an announcement about a scoping meeting this coming week.  The cards announcing this meeting were not mailed because corrections needed to be made.  Therefore, the scoping meeting will be on January 21, 2004.


- Last night there was an introductory meeting.  On Saturday December 20, 2003, there will be a walking tour; on January 14, 2004, there will be a working session with staff present; and on January 21, 2004, there will be a scoping meeting.


Re:  Staff's work load


- There is currently a staff work overload which is affecting many projects as well as the Planning Commission.  He realizes that one way to solve the problem is to work on the Discretionary Review policy which is before the Commission next week.  


- The other solution would be to limit the amount of paperwork presented in case reports.  He will be looking for ways to simplify the case report.


Re:  Entertainment Commission


- He had a meeting with the Acting Director and staff about ways to respond to his concerns.


- He will also be meeting with the president of the Commission.


Re:  Workforce Housing


- The Chamber of Commerce put this on the ballot for the March 2004 election.  It would direct staff to allow about 4 or 5 thousand units of housing in the central waterfront area, and expedite the review of this type of housing assuming it creates a second tier of affordable housing.


- It takes code changes to do this.


- The Board of Supervisors did not get the votes necessary to put this on the ballot in November.


- It also includes two million dollars for the Department to do environmental review and long range planning to implement this.  It does not broaden staff for neighborhood planning to expedite the permits that come in.  If this passes, staff will be looking to the Board of Supervisors to implement this in a timely manner.

11. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals


BOS - 


Land Use Commission actions of December 8, 2003


The Committee passed a resolution that renews, for one more year, the Interim Controls regulating certain industrially zoned properties on Third Street between Islais Creek and Paul Street.  These interim controls rezone these certain parcels from Industrial Zoning to NC-3, Moderate-Scale Neighborhood Commercial.  This legislation was initiated by Supervisor Maxwell.


The Committee voted unanimously on an ordinance Designating 2926-2948 16th Street, the Labor Temple/Redstone Building, as a landmark under Planning Code Article 10.  To most, this building is known to house Theater Rhinoceros.  This legislation was initiated by Supervisor Daly.


Upcoming Appeals hearings at the Board of Supervisors on December 16, 2003:


701 Lombard Street


There is a question of whether there was a timely filing of this appeal.


The appeal is on the Planning Commission's decision from January 15, 2003, approving a final mitigated negative declaration for the proposed condominium project at 701 Lombard Street.  The appeal was filed November 6, 2003, or about 11 months after this Commission certified the mitigated negative declaration.


937-939 Jackson Street


Appeal of Determination of Categorical Exemption issued on September 30, 2003. Appeal Filed November 17, 2003.


899 North Point Street


Appeal of Categorical Exemption that was issued on March 12, 2003.


The Conditional Use hearing was continued to January 22, 2004.  This appeal is now scheduled before the Board of Supervisors on January 13, 2004.


BOA - 


Re:  355 Country Club Drive


- This project was a 1,400 square foot addition that the Commission reduced to 900 feet.  Before the City issued the permit, the applicant asked the City to deny it.  This denial went to the Board of Appeals and the Board increased the project to 1,100 square feet.  The permit was finally issued.  This permit was appealed to the Board of Appeals and the Board approved it again as an 1,100 square foot addition.


D. PUBLIC COMMENT ON AGENDA ITEMS WHERE THE PUBLIC HEARING HAS BEEN CLOSED


At this time, members of the public who wish to address the Commission on agenda items that have already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the public hearing has been closed, must do so at this time.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.

Re:  Continuance


Brad Hooper - Discretionary Review Requestor

- He is just asking for a little time so his wife can be here.

- He respects the right for the project sponsors to expand their homes.


- He respects the architect--the architect designed an addition to his house.


- He has two reasons to the Discretionary Review:  1) he would like the Commission and staff to bear in mind the cumulative impacts on mid-block open space of other additions that could occur if this one does.  There are at least three more families that are likely to expand if this one does; 2) It is important to voice the issues of the people who are most impacted, The Louie's and the Wongs.  Both of these parties are here to voice their opinion.


(-) James Louie


- The 927 Lake Street owner should get together with the rest of the neighbors to have more discussions and reach a mutually acceptable conclusion.

(+) Rob Mackethan - Project Sponsor


- He and his wife purchased their home about 10 years ago.  They now have three children and have actually "outgrown" their home.  That is the reason for the expansion.

SPEAKER(S):


(+) Julia Campbell - Project Sponsor


- They have always used the property as a single-family house.


- Bernard Street is a small alley where the properties have been owned for many, many years.


- The way the property has been designed is very awkward.


- They have three children and would like to remain living in San Francisco.  


- They also have support from the Russian Hill Neighbors Association because they would rather have this property converted to a single family home than have an addition constructed.


(+) Camala Moster - Project Architect


- This house is one of the earlier houses on the block and is very modest.


- Adding a second garage space to the single garage space will be an amenity.


- The space on the first floor could be used as a second unit.

RESIDENTIAL DEMOLITION POLICY
 - A proposal to modify and refine interim criteria to implement a Temporary Residential Demolition Policy requiring mandatory Discretionary Review of all dwelling unit demolitions not requiring Conditional Use authorization, with certain exceptions; to adopt a specific Soundness Determination process; and to adopt criteria for conformity with applicable General Plan policies and objectives; and a recommendation to apply this policy for an approximate six-month period, after which a long-term policy would be presented for consideration and adoption by the Commission.


Preliminary recommendation: Adopt the Temporary Residential Demolition Policy.


NOTE: On November 6, 2003, following public testimony, the Commission kept the Public Hearing open and continued this item to December 11, 2003.
 


SPEAKER(S):


William Abend - AIA


- The only one issue that he has is that there has been three different policies for demolitions.


- Something should be done so that the project applicant should not have to pay in order to have things revised.


- He is available for questions.


Jeremy Paul


- It has been a long process to develop a policy on this issue.


- The Board of Appeals is going to be looking for more than numerical criteria.  They are going to be looking at the opinions from the Commission about the project that is being demolished.


- It is important for people to understand what is in front of them and this criteria will help a lot.


- People should be proactive in managing their decisions about what to do with the housing stock.  This is something that should be included in the policy.


- There has to be subjective criteria as well.


Pat Buscovich


- This process needs to be thorough and this document is very thorough.


- There should be some additional check list information that needs to be incorporated:  the assessor's files; the three R reports from the Building Department; all permit histories; all the records from planning including whether the building is AS, and if it is AS, all the records, etc.


- The Planning Commission should understand that the Building Department is loath to tear a building down unless it is an eminent life-safety hazard.


- There are a large class of fire-damaged buildings that need to be torn down.


Hiroshi Fukuda - Richmond Community Association


- This hearing is being held during the holidays and that is why there are not that many people here.


- Any changes in the policy should be provided in a hand out so that the public knows what the changes are.


- The policy does not address the real issue of demolition.


Sue Hestor


- This policy should be adopted and moved along.


- There are lots of demolitions before the Commission and there are a lot of units that are being lost because of these demolitions.


- There is nothing objectionable in what staff is doing.


- It is very weary on people who are trying to stay on top of the documents.


- She would like [the policy] to have added a more thorough analysis of historical research.


ACTION: Approved as Corrected and Amended:
