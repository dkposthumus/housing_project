Initiation of Planning Code Amendments Establishing PDR Zoning Districts and Initiation of Zoning Map Amendments Applying these Designations to Certain Industrial Portions of Bayview Hunters Point
 
 - 
The Department is proposing a set of Code amendments to establish a PDR-1 (Light Industrial Buffer District) and a PDR-2 (Production, Distribution, and Repair District) in the Planning Code.
 
 
These zones will permit a wide variety of non-residential uses and will retain space for current and future light industrial activities.
 
 The Department is also proposing Zoning Map amendments that would apply these PDR Districts, and a South Basin Design and Development Special Use District, to certain industrial areas in Bayview Hunters Point currently zoned M-1 (Light Industrial) and M-2 (Heavy Industrial).
 
 These amendments would implement various objectives from the Bayview Hunters Point Area Plan, which seeks to retain space for jobs and light industrial activities and to reduce land use conflicts between housing and industry in the Bayview.

.
 
 Staff will respond to Commissioner questions from the informational hearing held on January 18, 2007 and provide clarifying information.

 The amendment would establish a PDR-1 Use District (Light Industrial Buffer), a PDR-2 Use District (Production, Distribution, and Repair), and a South Basin Design and Development Special Use District (South Basin SUD), and establish regulations on subdivisions, accessory uses, and the demolition of industrial structures in these districts.

 Consideration of a resolution of intent to initiate a Zoning Map amendment consisting of revisions to Sectional Maps 8, 9, 10, and 10 SU of the Zoning Map of the City and County of San Francisco.
 
 This amendment would: 1) reclassify the area generally bounded by Cesar Chavez Street, Barneveld Avenue, McKinnon Avenue, Evans Avenue, and Third Street from M-2 to PDR-2; 2) reclassify the area generally bounded by Loomis Street, the I-280 Freeway, Oakdale Avenue, and the Caltrain right-of-way from M-1 (Light Industrial) to PDR-2 (Production, Distribution, and Repair); 3) reclassify much of the South Basin District, generally bounded by Bayshore Boulevard, Paul Avenue, Egbert Avenue, Yosemite Slough, the Hunters Point Shipyard, Thomas Avenue, and Williams Avenue from M-1 to PDR-2; 4) establish a PDR-1 (Light Industrial Buffer) designation over the northern and southern edges of the South Basin District, on the east side of Third Street, roughly along Fitzgerald, Van Dyke, Underwood, and Thomas Avenues – on properties currently zoned M-1; and 5) apply the South Basin SUD (South Basin Design and Development Special Use District) to the area generally bounded by Paul Avenue, Bayshore Boulevard, Phelps Street, Williams Avenue, and Third Street.
 


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Approve the resolution of intent to initiate the Zoning Map amendment.
