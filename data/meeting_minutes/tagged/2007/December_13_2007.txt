-
 
 
I was invited to attend a review for this project and could not attend.


-
 
 
I put in writing to the project designer my concerns on sunlight obstruction and the devaluation of property.


-
 
 
I object to the third story and support the second story for the accommodation of their family's need.


-
 
 
Our assessment shows that the project is out of scale and not compatible with the neighborhood.


-
 
 
With the new proposed expansion, the house would have two additional bedrooms and four extra rooms that are not fully disclosed in the respond to my request.


Sung Choung, Project Sponsor


-
 
 
I need more space to accommodate my family. 
 
We have a need for more rooms.


Hawk Lee, Architect

most of the blocks bound by Laguna, Haight, Buchanan and Hermann Streets, Lots 1, 2 and a portion of Lot 3 in Assessor's Block 870 and Lots 1 and 1A in Assessor's Block 857 
- Consideration of a Resolution of Intention to initiate amendments to the Market and Octavia Area Plan element of the General Plan to amend Map 1 – Land Use Districts and Map 3 - Height Districts.
 
 Amendment to the Housing element, Residence element and Land Use Index of the General Plan to amend Map 2 – Generalized Residential Land Use Plan and Map 3- Residential Density Plan. The proposal is to construct seven (7) new buildings and adaptively reuse three (3) existing buildings to create approximately 330 dwelling units, a large institutional residential care facility to accommodate senior residents (operated by  openhouse ), approximately 12,000 square feet of community facility space, no more than 4, 9999 occupied square feet of commercial/retail space,
 
 and approximately 300 off-street parking spaces.
 
 The project would include construction of an approximately 25,000 square foot publicly-accessible park on the former Waller Street right-of-way and a community garden of approximately 10,000 square feet.
 
 The existing University of California Extension site is located in a P (Public) Zoning District and 80-B and 40-X Height and Bulk Districts. Conditional Use authorization is required to locate a community facility in an R (Residential) District pursuant to Planning Code Section 209.4, to develop lots in excess of 10,000 square feet in an NC-3 District pursuant to Planning Code Sections 712.11 and 121.1 and to develop a non-residential use in excess of 5,999 square feet in an NC-3 District pursuant to Planning Code Sections 712.21 and 121.2.

The property is located within a P (Public) District and 40-X and 80-B Height and Bulk Districts.


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Approve a draft Resolution of Intention to initiate amendments to the General Plan.


 


SPEAKERS


Arnold
Price, Owner of Hispanic Building


-
 
 I'm opposed to the change because it is going to impact the neighborhood negatively. 
 
With so many affordable housing in process in the area we would loose our view.


David Winslow


-
 
 
Asked the commission to consider a continuance of this matter to January next year to have the Market – Octavia Plan indeed resolved, and to give people a chance to comment because of the holidays.


Tes Welborn


-
 
 
There are many considerations that we want to talk about - like parking and density - and there is no need to rush on something with such short notice.


Cynthia Servetnick


-
 
 
We are looking at what might be the best way for some kind of a better project on the site.


-
 
 
I'm concerned that the project does not have a high rate of below market inclusionary housing.


Lynne Creighton


-
 
 
This should be continued because this is an important site and needs more discussion to increase the public affordable housing rate, more open space, and less parking.


Robin Levitt


-
 
 
I have concerns about traffic; amount of parking is high; affordable housing is low and these things should be looked at very carefully if indeed the project is going through.

EASTERN NEIGHBORHOODS PROGRAM
 - The Eastern Neighborhoods Program encompasses the Mission, Central Waterfront, East SoMa and Showplace Square/Potrero Hill. Planning staff, together with City Agency partners, will hold an informal discussion session with the Planning Commission to discuss and answer questions on the Final Public Review Draft Area Plans, due to be released on December 1st.
 
 (This session is expected to last several hours and will include opportunities for public comment.
 
 A general agenda for the session will be available at easternneighborhoods.sfplanning.org several days before the hearing.)


Preliminary Recommendation:  No action requested (informational item)


 


SPEAKERS


Calvin Welch, Council for Community Housing Organizations


-
 
 
I certainly support the objective of trying to increase rental housing. 
 
I believe that the need is for affordable rental housing and not necessarily market rate.


-
 
 
I think there is a missing aspect to the housing proposals of the Mayor's Office of Housing and that is the impact of rezoning on already established neighborhoods in the Mission and Potrero Hill.


-
 
 
Basically what we are looking at is a proposal to do large new construction on formally industrial land. 
 
This is the Mayor's Office affordable housing program for the Eastern Neighborhoods.


-
 
 
What we are being offered in Potrero Hill and the Mission by this plan is either a limited number of new constructed permanent affordable units or ownership units.


-
 
 
We have asked the Mayor's Office Housing to take a very strong look at acquisition and rehabilitation of existing buildings in existing neighborhoods in order to offer some deep affordability for existing residents.


-
 
 
If we can not produce enough rental units, how do we make a dent by producing 150 percent of median affordable ownership housing?


-
 
 
There is no State or Federal subsidy program to build affordable units for 100 to 120 percent of median income.


Brett Gladstone


-
 
 
I'm representing some property owners in the former industrial protection zoning in the Mission.


-
 
 
Examination of every permit is going to take a long time to figure out. 
 
And then there is a lot of time at the Board of Appeals.


-
 
 
You should look at an amnesty program for those businesses that are there already.


-
 
 
Questioned the 25 percent industrial office use in the City versus 33 percent at South of Market. 
 
Why not increase that 25 percent?


Fred Snyder


-
 
 
This is the best dialogue that I have heard in eight years and hope that you not let it stop here.


-
 
 
I'm concerned about loosing jobs in the Eastern Neighborhoods.


Joe Boss


-
 
 
I'd like to see more examination of the affordable rental housing.


-
 
 
We need some sort of system to help families who cannot afford to move out from under-occupied housing and allow reusing those buildings with people that need that space.


Shawn Kinker


-
 
 
There are serious flaws in this plan. 
 
The development community is willing to participate where value is added.
 
 As it is right now there are very few sites with that added value.


Bob Meyers


-
 
 
The new zoning is based on two huge incorrect assumptions: preserving and attracting PDR, and creating affordable or moderate housing are not viable.


-
 
 
Why are the few projects in the pipeline for a long time carrying the affordability burden?


Dake


-
 
 
It is not logical to restrict the amount of space to a lower percentage as the building gets higher. 
 
PDR space is best to be on the ground floor.


[Inaudible]


-
 
 
We need to look at 16
th
 Street as a neighborhood corridor because it is wide and goes all the way up to the Third Street rail.


Greg Miller


-
 
 
You should direct staff to look very carefully at increasing height limits and affordable housing in East SoMa with all the improvements in the area it could hold more density developments in a meaningful way.


Brat


-
 
 
Asked the Commission to direct staff to look at how many businesses do not have permits and look at ways to minimize displacement of companies, especially the ones that are growing and benefit the economy of the City.


Judy


-
 
 Requested a 90 day extension - pass the January 10, 2008 deadline for public comments.

 I was at a Japantown workshop several Saturdays ago and we were presented designs for a residential tower at Gough and Post as well as several concept designs for the Japan Center.


-
 
 With respect of the high rise tower, can we have staff give us a report as to where that is within the process?


Craig Nikitas, Acting Zoning Administrator


-
 
 To my knowledge, and we could verify it for next week, all we have on file for that project is an environmental application.
 
 We will let you know the status of the environmental review.


-
 
 No other entitlement request has been filed.


Commissioner Sugaya


-
 
 Secondly, and back to the Japantown Better Neighborhood Program, there has been some discussion that I mentioned to Mr. Rich about perhaps extending the boundaries down to Fillmore Street, to the substation site or a little bit further to the south, and also to include the Safeway site.

SPEAKERS


Andrew Junius, Representing Project Sponsor


-
 
 
We were here a month ago and you gave us assignments.


-
 
 
We worked with the  Quakers' Meeting on them five times this past month and they withdraw their opposition.
 
 We have a written statement of their support.


-
 
 
We have moved the garage about 140 feet the other way to the north towards Market Street.
 
 That is a significant improvement for the  Quakers' in terms of noise, traffic and safety concerns.


-
 
 
In doing this, we had to reconfigure the garage and we are looking at a split garage with 16 spaces served directly off Laskie Street and 90 spaces served by the main garage off 9
th
 Street.


-
 
 
We did research and reconfirmed that Laskie Street is too narrow to handle two-way traffic.


-
 
 
 Anca' [Project Sponsor] is willing to work with the City and adjacent property owners on Laskie Street to improve that street.


Silvia Johnson


-
 
 
I am willing to work with organizations to improve Laskie Street and have some sketches that I would bring to the property owners.


David


-
 
 
Thanked everybody's work. 
 
The conversations with the project sponsor have been cordial and we fully support the project.

SPEAKERS


Michael Burnside


-
 
 
As you consider the future of the City, you need to understand that there are many people like me that can not afford living here while making a $2,000 monthly salary.


-
 
 
I thought your children at school and I do not own a property here.


Silvia Johnson


-
 
 It is very important to take it easy and you will see that the process would be better for our world and have a better understanding of why new construction is very important for the future.


David


-
 
 
Based on my experience with 9
th
 Street project presented today, I'm concerned about the way the Planning Department conducts its business for the people of San Francisco regarding the lack of general assessment of cumulative impacts as buildings go up around the neighborhoods.
