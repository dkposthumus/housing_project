Requests for Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit Application No. 2006.01.31.3422 proposing to construct a 4-foot tall vertical addition to accommodate a third floor of occupancy and a 4-foot deep and 10-foot wide horizontal addition within the last 15 feet of the lot in an existing two-story single-family home located in an RH-2 (House, Two-Family) District and 40-X Height and Bulk District. The project is also subject to a rear yard variance for the horizontal addition (Case No. 2005.0633V), which will be heard by the Zoning Administrator immediately after the Planning Commission hears the requests for Discretionary Review.


Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve
 
the project as revised.


 
 
(Continued from Regular Meeting of May 24, 2007)


 


SPEAKERS


Phil Lalonde, 1
st
 Discretionary Review Requestor


-
 
 We (26 neighbors), and Golden Gate Valley Neighborhood Association, are opposed to the rear yard variance.


-
 
 We understand that the project sponsor has the right to build within San Francisco's planning guidelines.


-
 
 The Department encouraged all parties to try to solve issues.


-
 
 The neighborhood is strongly opposed to their first plan design.


-
 
 The final design was not presented to the neighbors.


-
 
 At a meeting, we learned that the Department was proposing approval of this project and we sent a letter opposing it.


-
 
 We submitted a letter and a petition opposing this project.


-
 
 The existing non-compliant structure already encroaches in the rear yard area.


-
 
 The proposed addition would have a negative impact on property values.


-
 
 Our second issue is to reduce the roofline.


-
 
 Shared photos showing existing rooflines and the ones representing the addition.


Debbie Ann Cucalon, 2
nd
 Discretionary Review Requestor


-
 
 I own the property adjacent to the proposed project.


-
 
 It would block our light and air in an already constricted area.


-
 
 It would set precedence for others to do the same thing.


-
 
 The loss of privacy would be of paramount importance.
 
 We would be shaded by its leaning presence.


-
 
 There is not enough space for this massive tower without impacting us.


-
 
 Golden Gate Valley Neighborhood Association supports us and urged you to consider an alternative to alleviate the impact on neighbors.


-
 
 Consider lowering the roof height by 18 inches and require the staircase to be built indoors.


-
 
 We have alternative designs for this project.


Michael Zucker, Architect


-
 
 We would like to share with you alternative designs with these sketches.


-
 
 It is possible to do it by lowering the roof and building inside the property.


Joanne Rosendin, 3
rd
 Discretionary Review Requestor


-
 
 I agreed to all the comments made previously.


-
 
 The proposed structure would totally shade my entire house.


-
 
 I am very concerned about light and air.


-
 
 Urged the Commission to consider the historic value of our homes.


Alice Barrlet, Attorney for Project Sponsor


-
 
 This location map shows the property of the proposed project and the discretionary review requestors.


-
 
 I just want to show you a project model of existing building conditions and the addition proposed.


-
 
 It does not touch the original cottage.


-
 
 Staff indicated that it was a little large because most of the addition was at the rear yard.


-
 
 Project was made smaller creating a deck.


-
 
 Sponsor then moved it forward to keep a 25-foot back yard.


-
 
 This is the model we came up with working with staff [model #5]


-
 
 We included in the project package a shadow study based on Pacific Gas and Electricity [PG&E] tables.


Irina Yuen, Project Sponsor


-
 
 We sent letters of support electronically.


-
 
 We are requesting a modest addition to accommodate our daughter.


-
 
 This process started when I was pregnant.
 
 My daughter is now 18 months old.


-
 
 We feel very fortunate to live in San Francisco.


-
 
 Even with this addition, our house would still be the smallest property on the block.


-
 
 This modest change would make a big difference in our lives.


-
 
 10 immediate neighbors support our project as well as many others.


Jon Sobel


-
 
 We have worked closely with the city and our neighbors.


-
 
 Many neighbors support our project.


-
 
 We did everything to reasonably accommodate the concerns of our neighbors.


-
 
 We have made a number of changes by moving the addition forward, reducing the size, and increase the set back.


-
 
 This time, after our constant efforts to accommodate our neighbors' needs, we are asking this Commission to consider our project.


Roask O'Neil


-
 
 My family is the only one with small children on the block.


-
 
 We are sympathetic with challenges that families face today.


-
 
 It is difficult to find a place in the city that is good for families.


-
 
 We believe that reasonable accommodations for families to stay in the city should be supported.


-
 
 This project is a modest addition to a relatively small house.


-
 
 This family has made all efforts to take into account the neighbor's concerns.


 


ACTION:
 
 Did not take Discretionary Review and approved.

MISSION BAY
 
-
 
This is an 
informational presentation
 on the Mission Bay Planning Process, Design for Development Controls, and recent developments.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of May 17, 2007)


 


SPEAKERS


Amy, Senior Project Manager with the Redevelopment Agency


-
 
 [From a power point presentation she showed:] This is the area of Mission Bay from about two years ago with a large flat area.


-
 
 This was Federal and State Land given to the railroad after War World II.


-
 
 The Mission Bay Plan that was adopted in 1998 incorporates 303 acres.


-
 
 The goal of the plan is to create a new mixed-use community including university, residential, and commercial.


-
 
 The initial studies of 1998 suggested that the final population of Mission Bay would be about 11,000 residents and 31,000 workers.


-
 
 In the Northern part of Mission Bay, the Land use plan includes 6,000 residential units and at least 28 percent would be affordable.


-
 
 Most of the affordable housing would be built on [Redevelopment] Agency parcels.


-
 
 In the Southern part of Mission Bay is the University of California campus under development.


-
 
 The area surrounding the University is zoned for 5,000,000 square feet of office and biotechnology.


-
 
 On this plan [power point], it does not show the UCSF hospital, which is the area South of 16
th
 Street.


-
 
 There is also a plan for a hotel close to the Creek and AT&T Ballpark.


-
 
 There are sites for a fire station, police station and a new public school.


-
 
 About $5,000,000 has been invested in new infrastructure for streets, traffic system, under utilities.


-
 
 Any costs that cannot be covered by public financing are paid directly by the master developer.


-
 
 The Redevelopment Agency entered into an owner's participation agreement with the master developer to set forward the pace and timing within the Redevelopment process.


-
 
 The goal of this participation agreement is to bundle private projects with public benefits.


-
 
 I want to focus a little bit on the interagency cooperation agreement â a very innovative agreement.


-
 
 It was adopted by eight city departments including the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors.


-
 
 Each party had to commit into the redevelopment plan and controls.


-
 
 The Planning Commission has the lead role in design review for any project that is subject to Section 321 â Office space allocation.


-
 
 The Redevelopment Commission has final approval of residential projects not requiring office space allocations.


-
 
 These are some of the models we used at the time and have been developed since to help informed the review process [from the power point].


-
 
 The goals are to create high density, urban and pedestrian environments.


-
 
 The height limit for Mission Bay is 160 feet.


-
 
 There are extensive rules about height; towers; bulk and street walk requirements.


-
 
 In an attempt to create this high-density urban environment, there are requirements for all major streets.


-
 
 There is a planting plan to have trees on every block.


-
 
 [She showed some of models that have been done.]


-
 
 It is difficult to design on a 300-acre area where there are no surrounding buildings to use as a context.


-
 
 We required the developers to submit a major face plan for one or more serious blocks.


-
 
 Then, we look at a particular project.


-
 
 We have established [currently working through] the design process for commercial buildings.


-
 
 We have eight residential with 1,636 units that are completed and are being occupied.


-
 
 There are six residential projects under construction with about 1,000 units with additional affordable housing.


-
 
 UCSF has moved quickly.
 
 Five buildings are completed, one is under construction and they are in the planning process for the Children's Hospital.


-
 
 Two commercial projects are now in the construction drawings and permitting phase.


-
 
 Also, there are eight acres of completed parks in Mission Bay.
 
 They are maintained by the Redevelopment Agency with funding provided by private owners of the area.


-
 
 We have several more parks under construction and development including a spectacular children's park.


Joe Alioto


-
 
 It is important for responsible government to make sure that the left hand knows what the right hand is doing.


-
 
 Keep in mind that money needs to be allocated for police officers to patrol the neighborhoods.


-
 
 In the future when considering these plans, there should be some sort of communication with the Police Commission.


 


ACTION:
 
 
No Action required of the Commission. Informational Only.

SPEAKERS


Joe Alioto


-
 
 I am here as a private citizen.


-
 
 I sent a letter to Commissioners regarding a particular project at 770 Powell Street.


-
 
 Urged the Commission to take a close look at this project and support the expiration of the particular site permit that has expired.
