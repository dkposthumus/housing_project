Initiation of Planning Code Amendments Establishing PDR Zoning Districts and Initiation of Zoning Map Amendments Applying these Designations to Certain Industrial Portions of Bayview Hunters Point
 
 - 
The Department is proposing a set of Code amendments to establish a PDR-1 (Light Industrial Buffer District) and a PDR-2 (Production, Distribution, and Repair District) in the Planning Code.
 
 
These zones will permit a wide variety of non-residential uses and will retain space for current and future light industrial activities.
 
 The Department is also proposing Zoning Map amendments that would apply these PDR Districts, and a South Basin Design and Development Special Use District, to certain industrial areas in Bayview Hunters Point currently zoned M-1 (Light Industrial) and M-2 (Heavy Industrial).
 
 These amendments would implement various objectives from the Bayview Hunters Point Area Plan, which seeks to retain space for jobs and light industrial activities and to reduce land use conflicts between housing and industry in the Bayview.
 


 


A) 
Informational Item

 Staff will respond to Commissioner questions from the informational hearing held on January 18, 2007 and provide clarifying information.

 The amendment would establish a PDR-1 Use District (Light Industrial Buffer), a PDR-2 Use District (Production, Distribution, and Repair), and a South Basin Design and Development Special Use District (South Basin SUD), and establish regulations on subdivisions, accessory uses, and the demolition of industrial structures in these districts.

.
 
 Consideration of a resolution of intent to initiate a Zoning Map amendment consisting of revisions to Sectional Maps 8, 9, 10, and 10 SU of the Zoning Map of the City and County of San Francisco.

COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
 
(Tape IA)


 


6.
 
 Commission Comments/Questions




Inquiries/Announcements
.
 
 Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).


Future Meetings/Agendas
. 
 
At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.




 


Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 I have some questions regarding springing conditions that came up at last week's hearing.


-
 
 These are comments that I heard from the public and I think it is worth a discussion of them.


-
 
 Is it legal to impose conditions without a nexus study? How are the fees to be used?




Are they going to be used for infrastructure purposes or parks?
 




-
 
 It is an important issue and the public wants to know.


-
 
 I also would like a list of projects that have had springing conditions in the past.


-
 
 I wonder if they have been applied to residential developments.


-
 
 About additional below market rate units:
 
 Generally they come in return for height and density bonuses.


-
 
 This is the first time I remember changes being made about below market rate as they applied to 736 Valencia Street and 3400 Cesar Chavez.


-
 
 I would like to know how or why this applied to those projects.


-
 
 Lastly a young couple--patients of mine--illustrates the situation in the city regarding housing.


-
 
 Being first time homebuyers, they are moving to Concord even thought they want to stay in San Francisco.


-
 
 The only choice they found in the city was a 1 bedroom in the $500,000 dollars range versus in Concord in the $300,000 dollars range for a 2 bedroom home.


-
 
 My comments are based on studies showing that we are building almost no housing in the 60 to 80 percentile for people in San Francisco.


-
 
 We may speak more about this situation on the Eastern Neighborhood presentation.


-
 
 I am hoping we can come up with a formula and be able to include different inclusionary systems for builders to include 80 to 140 percentile.


-
 
 I called some researchers for data to compare costs in other cities regarding fees and materials.


-
 
 We should know where those areas are and if we could do something in our process to minimize cost in order to increase affordability on projects.


Commissioner Alexander


-
 
 I would like to remind Commissioner Antonini that we agreed last week to not impose springing conditions.


Commissioner W. Lee


-
 
 I have a question on mitigation fees: How do we justify $13 a square foot for housing and $4 a square foot for commercial?


-
 
 Last week on one of the projects, that amount came out of nowhere and was approved voluntarily by the Project Sponsor.


-
 
 Rincon Hill was approved for $23 a square foot and it appears to work.


-
 
 Bayview has a different fee of dollars and with high-rises would benefit to provide funding to off set the affordable housing.


-
 
 I would like staff to provide to us an analysis for a formula on community benefit fees.


-
 
 The construction for downtown with the Market and Octavia Plan with the high-rises the fee should be higher.


-
 
 Now, we are going into the Eastern Neighborhood and I do not know what model we used to justify these fees.


-
 
 I think staff has to come back within a month and give us directions on what is a fair fee and if they could respond as to when they can provide that information.


Commissioner Alexander


-
 
 Other Commissioners have to conquer on that request for staff to generate it.


-
 
 What we did last week was something that we reasonable for the project to move forward.


-
 
 It is the full intention of staff to go back and put together what the actual cost would be until the new zoning comes out.


-
 
 Developers have the choice to move forward or wait until the new zoning and fees come out.


Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 I support that request.
 
 It is definitely an important subject.


Dean Macris, Director of Planning


-
 
 It was a voluntary matter and if the Commission would like to have further discussion about fees, we could certainly do that.


-
 
 It does need further analysis and we are working on that.


-
 
 It is a very important subject to discuss.


-
 
 Mr. President could instruct what he would like us to do -- whether to schedule time to discuss or to produce a report.


Commissioner W. Lee


-
 
 We had two projects coming up and charged $13 a square foot for community benefits.


-
 
 Commercial spaces are charged $4 a square foot and I wonder why not charge the reverse, $13 for commercial and $4 for housing?


-
 
 Some other questions that I have are the allocation of that money.
 
 Where it goes and if we could allocate it for affordable housing?


Commissioner Alexander


-
 
 There is specification on the money collected for public benefit to be used on parks, street improvements and sidewalks.


Commissioner Olague


-
 
 I am happy with the respond from staff about intent to establish some controls for Eastern Neighborhood.


-
 
 The Mission Neighborhood has been neglected because of the absence of permanent controls.


-
 
 It is important to finalize and get to a conclusion of a process that has taken so long.

Request for Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit Application No. 2006.12.14.0894, proposing construction of a second story vertical addition to an existing one story over garage residence in a RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project as submitted.


 


SPEAKERS


Collet Fontanneli, Discretionary Review Requestor




Sunlight would be obstructed in my bathroom, bedroom and my deck/garden.


Why should I be deprived of simple little pleasures like sunlight?


Project does not comply with the Victorian character of the entire neighborhood.




Stewart Hills, Project Architect


-
 
 The subject property is a regular size lot.
 
 Its depth corresponds to similar corner lots in the neighborhood.
 
 However, there is only a 13-foot wide limit.




With these limitations, the only option is a vertical addition.


The design meets the guidelines.
 
 The addition sets back from the front and rear property line.


We added a bay window for a better articulation of the faÃ§ade on the Roanoke Street side.


Addition is modern in design and compliments the existing structure.


Regarding privacy: the requestor's home sits on the corner lot and there would not be any additional view than currently exists.




-
 
 Subject property sits at a 135-degree angle northeast of the DR requestor's property.


-
 
 Following path of the sun throughout different seasons, the sun does not cast greater than 120-degree angle.


Mike Shainne, Owner




We need the extra bedroom to accommodate my daughter.


Submitted a letter from the next-door neighbor supporting the project.

Request for Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit Application No. 2006.0609.3616,
 
proposing construction of a four-story horizontal addition to the rear of the subject dwelling
 
in an RH-1 (Residential, House, One-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Note
:
 
 This case was first presented at the 3/15/07 Planning Commission hearing.
 
 On that date, the Department's recommendation was: Take Discretionary Review and approve the project with modifications.
 
The Commission continued this matter to 4/26/07 with instructions to the project sponsor to consider a new design and neighborhood character.
The Department's preliminary recommendation below is based on the revised submission.


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Take Discretionary Review and approve the project with modifications.


 


SPEAKERS


Sue Hestor, Discretionary Review Requestor




What you requested has not been provided by the developer.


You asked that this project to be made narrower and shorter.




-
 
 We have not seen information on the visual impact on Ms. Yamagushi who is the property owner to the north of this project.




They have not shown visuals of what people are going to see from their level.


There is no real information about it.




-
 
 Sponsor wants to maximize their space no matter what the impacts are on their neighbors.




This is a very special setting.




-
 
 We have not received any phone calls for a meeting from the engineer to respond to concerns.




They came back basically with the same model.




James Zhao, Representing Adjacent Neighbor


-
 
 I have reviewed the revised plans produced by the project architect and have found that the main issue still has not been addressed.


-
 
 It would impact, impair and weaken the structure foundation system supporting my client's house adjacent to the subject property.




The solution would demand changes in the architect's design of the proposed addition.


The exterior walls on both sides would need to set back 4 feet and 6 inches.




-
 
 Two piers along property line support six houses and construction needs to be away from those piers.


Mildred Yamagushi




I was asked to sign a petition in support for a modest addition and I did.


This is not a modest addition.


I have a big concern with the common foundation of these properties.




Louise Victor


-
 
 We are very frustrated with this process with the lack of communication.


-
 
 Contacts were not made from Project Sponsor until plans were submitted.




Project is still too big and not feasible for the neighbors.


Requested that the commission consider this carefully.




Leon




I just want to show with these photos the massiveness of this project.




Robert Colyer, Project Architect




We had done a number of revisions intending to reduce the profile of the building.


The concern was made about the middle block open space.


We compromised 37 percent rear yard set back versus 25 percent required.


Massing study shows a number of prototypes to culminate the scheme of 1911 Funston.




-
 
 As originally designed, it did not have a very large addition on the upper floor with the intent of reducing its profile as seen from adjacent properties.




Project was designed to step-down the hill and step-in from the sides.


Showed digital photos of property renderings.


We did try to meet with the neighbors to get feedback.
 


In the past, at meetings with neighbors, we would get no feedback when we requested it.




Elizabeth Tippin, Project Sponsor Representative


-
 
 I just want to focus my comments on precedence in the area.


-
 
 The building at 1887 Funston Avenue is a large vertical mass that actually goes all the way out to a 30 percent set back.




1901 Funston Avenue has a deck on minus level 1, which is the same thing we are proposing.




-
 
 1923 and 1927 Funston properties have an existing deck that is approximately 3 to 4 feet away from the 30 percent set back line.




1914 Funston house already has the 25 percent set back.




-
 
 There is a lot of precedence that already exists in the block to establish the 37 percent set back as some sort of guidance for this development.




Basically this project is very consistent with the General Plan and buildings in the area.


Project would not impact views and sunlight.




-
 
 Sunlight gets to these houses until one o'clock and the biggest shadows come from trees on the property.


Roger Quiring




I have lived in the neighborhood for 21 years.




-
 
 I support this project mainly for the spirit of interest to meet with neighbors and listen to reasonable suggestions.




An effort has been made to mitigate discomfort.


The plans were prepared in accordance with city codes.




Debra Bowles, Project Sponsor




I am requesting the Commission make a decision.


I strongly feel that we have made every effort to work with neighbors.


This process has taken about 2 years and it is impacting our family economically.


Read a letter of support from a neighbor unable to attend because of illness.




 


 


Josh Weaver


-
 
 We used to live in the neighborhood and had to move out of the city because we had no choice.




We could not effort any addition to our house in that neighborhood




-
 
 The process the project sponsors have been going through would discourage residents to improve their homes.


Chet Matuszak


-
 
 Read a support letter on behalf of Harold Wong who lives at 1895 Funston Avenue.


Pat




I attended one of the meetings held by one of the Discretionary Review requestors.


People just do not want any construction done on that property.




-
 
 I am a union carpenter/general contractor and believe this project would help stabilized that hill.


 


ACTION:
 
 Took Discretionary Review and Approved as Staff recommended with a further modification to cut back 5 feet of office space on level negative 2.


AYES:
 
 Alexander, Antonini, S. Lee, W. Lee and Sugaya.

EASTERN NEIGHBORHOODS PROGRAM
 
- The Eastern Neighborhoods Program encompasses the Mission, Central Waterfront, East SoMa and Showplace Square.
 
 Bayview Hunters Point is undergoing a separate process, but shares some issues with the other neighborhoods.
 
 Staff will present a progress report on the Program, including a proposed schedule for completing the Eastern Neighborhoods area plans and rezoning, an update on proposals for affordable housing and public benefits and an overview of the basic land use proposals for the industrial lands.
 
 This progress report is the first of a series on the Eastern Neighborhoods that staff expects to present to the Planning Commission over the next several months.


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Informational Item, no action requested.


 


SPEAKERS


Doug Shoemaker, Major's Office of Housing


-
 
 In the Eastern Neighborhoods, the median household income tend to be lower than the rest of the City.


-
 
 The average household size is larger.




Four out of every five households are renters.


There is a need for a stock of low-income housing.




-
 
 We have existing city-financed housing between 600 to 1,200; and inclusionary housing between 950 to 1,350.


-
 
 Total affordable housing is 1,500 to 2,500 in the Eastern Neighborhood serving low, extreme-low, and medium income families.


-
 
 This is absolutely an average and it is based on different types of opportunities when they represented themselves.




Our goal is to produce more on the baseline than what we are doing right now.




-
 
 According to the housing inventory that Planning Department publishes on a regular basis, 30 percent of housing created in the city for the last 5 years is affordable.




Three main components of our strategy:




1)- Inclusionary Housing


We need to decide whether we want inclusionary or super-inclusionary housing in the Eastern Neighborhood.


A)-Baseline: 15% of total market rate production.


B)-Increase development potential zoning: creating new value to enable funding for additional affordable housing.


Options
:
 
 -Increase percentage requirement of units.


-Charge affordable housing fee.


-Provide choices for more affordability (number of units versus median income limits).


2)-Affordable Housing Priority Zone


A)-Allow new residential uses in areas currently zoned industrial only.


B)-Allow 100% affordable developments as-of right.


C)-Create incentives for mixed income residential developments (donate portion of parcel for affordable housing in exchange of market rate housing)


D)-Allow 100% moderate-income developments without the need of competing with luxury housing.


3)-City-financed affordable housing developments
:


A)-Current challenges are land availability and funding.


B)-Land represents 30-50% of City's subsidy and potential zone dedication could create over 1,000 affordable units.


C)-Because land would be donated throughout the process; the amount of money to fund units would be significantly less.




We are trying to address different needs.


There are strategies for very-low, low and moderate median income limits.




-
 
 There are very different affordable housing programs in the Bay View Hunter's Point.
 
 We are considering super inclusionary housing.


-
 
 We really want to emphasize public benefits zoning.
 
 What the financial possibilities are and prioritize what is needed.




Existing zonings changing for the new ones.
 
 We need a pattern for those changes.




-
 
 On May 14 and 15, we are going to meet with stakeholders and go over financial modem data for feedback.


Jessie Blout, Mayor's Office of Housing and Economic Workforce Development


-
 
 We have conducted an analysis over several decades regarding economic performance before releasing the economic development plan.




Structure of economy includes four broad clusters:




Knowledge Generation


Experience Generation


People Infrastructure


Physical Infrastructure








-
 
 Production Distribution and Repairs [PDR] industries provide employment opportunities for people without 4-year degrees.


-
 
 We have a workforce system for employment opportunities and important ramifications to provide trainings.


-
 
 It provides a strategy to make sure we are preparing people coming out of high school and those with no training at all.


-
 
 It is very important to keep in mind the growth of our economy for the next decade when deciding the land use.


Judy West


-
 
 We have been trying to build an arts and theater district in the Northern Mission on an underutilized site that is attracting criminal activities.


-
 
 Requested Production Distribution and Repairs zoning [PDR] not be applied on 16
th
 South of Mission Street.




In the Mission, absentee landlords who neglect their properties own housing.




-
 
 A housing strategy is to build condominiums for low-income families [below market rate] promoted by the city with unrealistic restrictions.




Locate below market rate units along transit corridors.




Toby Levine




Requested the Department to make The Mission Plan clearer to the residents.


For example, to list different Production Distribution and Repairs [PDR] uses.


You should add appendices and numbered pages and make reference to them.


Process should focus on planning and not politics.




Jeffrey Leibovitz




We are moving in the right direction with this kind of communication.




-
 
 Important elements to consider are employment opportunities, housing, historic resources and community benefits.


-
 
 Questioned the Production Distribution and Repairs [PDR], what type of business would these be and what would be the relationship, financially, to the neighbors.


Steven Aiello


-
 
 Urged the commission to pay close attention to the global issues and all areas of the specific plan.




We have shared our points with the Department.


Some concerns are height--to increase capacity, and affordable housing.




-
 
 We are missing production for the middle-income range, between 80 to 150% of annual median income.




Suggested to come up with strategies for those families to stay in San Francisco.




Tim Colen




We have been doing a lot of work and we will present it to the Commission shortly.




-
 
 We would like to see a balance in housing.
 
 There is a lack of production for middle-income families.


Calvin Welsch




First attempt on real comprehensive planning for the Eastern Neighborhood.




-
 
 Coordinated presentation between Planning, Major's Office of Housing and Economic Workforce Development closes a huge gap from other attempts.




Unified School District and Muni should be part of this communication.




-
 
 The presentation had no reference on the policy statement from the Board of Supervisor.




We need to work together to make this plan work for everybody.




-
 
 We need to really think thoroughly and make a reality the affordable housing component for the Eastern Neighborhood.


Scott




Concerned about what the real community benefit components are.
 
 It is unclear.




-
 
 Putting affordable housing everywhere would create problems.
 
 We need truth protection and stabilization.
 
 Put housing where there should be housing and not with industrials.


Fred Snyder


-
 
 This process has taken 7 years and it is still unclear what is going to happen in my neighborhood.




I would like to see a comprehensive plan to move forward.


Our neighborhood would have all affordable housing and that is not right.




-
 
 The idea of donating portions of parcels would downsize the tendency to make those properties available for affordable housing.




Owner would not know what type of tenant is coming to the property.




Brett Gladstone




Requested the Department to include an explanation of decisions made on new policies.




-
 
 We would like an opportunity to discuss what one square foot of PDR to 4 square feet for other use such as housing.
 
 Is it net or gross footage?


-
 
 It is unclear on the chart if the list of subdivision of units would become a conditional use.
 
 It needs some clarification of that.


Douglass Lin


-
 
 There are no Production Distribution and Repairs [PDR] tenants in SOMA district because of heavy traffic and no parking.


-
 
 900 to 1000 market-rate units are available and nobody is buying them.
 
 Building affordable housing in that area would freeze those units for 20 years.


Chris Durazo


-
 
 Requested to freeze the Production Distribution and Repairs [PDR] and remove affordable housing overlay in East SOMA.




This area is not appropriate for light industrial because of heavy traffic and no parking.




Bob Mayers


-
 
 Requesting to remove staff proposal of overlay for mix use district between 3
rd
 and 4
th
 Street.


-
 
 Restricting building affordable housing would jeopardize projects in process in the East SOMA offering 900 units, including 125 units guaranteed to be affordable.


Peter Cohen




Commended staff for providing an excellent presentation.


We worked on affordable housing, policies and economic development policies.


We are interested to see how things mediate throughout the land use controls.




-
 
 Land use stability is critical in moving forward as part of a diverse economy.


Shannon


-
 
 I am in support of the Board of Supervisor policy statement regarding Eastern Neighborhood and meeting the housing element goals to the extent that we can.


-
 
 Land dedication ideas, overlay of affordable housing, and other tools are important components.




This plan could make a real difference if done right.




Judy


-
 
 Regarding the maps:
 
 Franklin Square Park would be the only remaining park in the whole planning area.




Parks are very important and we should try to keep as much as we can.




-
 
 Pacific Gas & Electricity property and other large areas should be labeled the way Muni property is.


 


ACTION:
 
 Informational only.
 
 No action needed by the Commission

SPEAKERS:


Judy West


-
 
 I am extremely concerned with our approach to a liquefaction zone in the Eastern Neighborhood.


-
 
 The effort to downzone the areas that are most at risk of an earthquake is unacceptable.


-
 
 You must find a way to encourage other types of investment in these areas.


-
 
 Production Distribution and Repairs zoning [PDR] would make it almost impossible for urban upgrades.


Chris Durazo


-
 
 Requested the appointment of a staff member to report on the cumulative impacts of all the different plans in the City [Market-Octavia, Transbay, Rincon Hill and Eastern Neighborhoods]
