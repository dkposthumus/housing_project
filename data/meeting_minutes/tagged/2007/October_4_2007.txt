Future Meetings/Agendas
.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.




Commissioner Antonini


-  I would just like to comment on the report that we got from Teresa Ojeda on the projects in the pipeline.  I think it was extremely well done.


-  I would ask members of the public or interested parties to contact the Planning Department for this report.


-  We have 30,000 housing units that are presently in the pipeline that are considered projects that are planned, have gained approval, or are under construction.


-  There is six millions square feet of commercial space and we have about 25% of that is under construction, 28 have been approved, and the balance is in the pre-approval process.


-  There is a lot of very interesting data in that report and I think it was extremely well done and answers a lot of questions that we frequently ask on how much is being built, approved and proposed.


-  It breaks it into commercial, PDR and retail projects.  I recommended it highly.


Commissioner Olague


-  I would like to thank Espanola Jackson and others who helped to secure this place for us to have this hearing in the Bayview and we feel very honored to be out here in the community.

New Crystal Springs Bypass Tunnel
 
- 
Hearing to Receive Public Comment on Draft Environmental Impact Report
 - The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) is sponsoring a proposed project that calls for the construction of a tunnel, about 4,200 feet long with a 96-inch diameter pipeline in the tunnel for conveyance of drinking water to the regional water delivery system in San Mateo County and San Francisco. This project would be located in the SFPUC right-of-way along and near Polhemus and Crystal Springs Roads in San Mateo County.  The tunnel would replace an existing pipeline that is subject to geologic hazards from slope instability.  Key features of the proposed Project include:


·
 
 
Excavation of an 4,200-foot long tunnel using a tunnel boring machine or open-face shield roadheader;


·
 
 
Excavation of shafts (north and south) on either end of the tunnel to depths ranging from about 60 to 200 feet; and


·
 
 
Disposal of tunnel and shaft excavation spoils on lands adjacent to the south shaft area on SFPUC lands or at an off-site permitted facility.


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 
No Action Required.  Public hearing to receive comments


only.


Note: 
 
Written comments will be received at the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m. on October 9, 2007.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of September 6, 2007)




SPEAKERS


David Byers, Representing the San Mateo Oaks Home Owner's Association


-
 
 
Concerned about the noise during the three years and nine months of night time construction and night time noise limits.  What is going to happen when there is no compliance?


-
 
 
The Draft Environmental Impact Report has a solution to that project.  It is alternative number two and that is what my clients ask that you review very seriously.


David Leibs


-  Concerned about health.  The particles that this would generate for three years and having to keep windows closed everyday for such a long time.


Joe Manske


-
 
 
Opposes the project because it is unnecessary.  You can accomplish the same thing with an open trench pipe line, which is secure and easy to repair.


-
 
 
Noise and pollution is not acceptable when you have an alternative for this project.


Norma Bozzini


-
 
 
As a physician, I am very concerned about the health impacts that this would have on this neighborhood with the pollution that would be generated.


-
 
 
Noise levels were inadequately assessed.  We would not be able to sleep seven days a week for nine months and this is completely unreasonable.


Darlene Harms


-  Proposed acceptance of alternative number 2 has the full capacity to pass the pipe line and repair the existing crystal springs bypass tunnel.


Michel B. Allen


-
 
 
This is a mayor project taking place in a residential neighborhood and it would generate noise problems so significant to make it almost impossible for people to sleep for three years.


-
 
 
The problem is not only the noise but the vibration that this is going to cause.  Land slides have happened in the past and there is no study on that.


-
 
 
This project is not necessary and I request that you take alternative number 2.


Gene Ciranni


-
 
 
Opposes this project because of the lack of truth regarding the necessity of it and the land slide history in the area with the potential that it could happen again. 




Lydia
Leibs


-  This project is going to bring hazardous waste being dumped in the open and a lot of people's health is going to be suffering for a project that is not particularly needed.


James Mullins


-
 
 
Concerned about the dynamiting of the area.  We have slide issues in our area.


-
 
 
Propose that you go with alternative number 2 if we can not go with number 1.


Lynn Loveall


-
 
 
The project is near the Peninsula Water Shed Management Plan and this project meets the goal of protecting the water shed.


-
 
 
The document says that the area looks like an industrial site and it does not.  It looks like a valley.


-
 
 
This money could be better utilized in other areas and I urge you to review other options.


Nicole Sandkulla


-
 
 
This tunnel has already been in danger by landslide during winter and if it is damaged it will cut off a mayor source of water to many people.


-
 
 
The Environmental Impact Report does a good job of addressing the potential impacts and I urge the Planning Commission to certify it.


Francisco DaCosta


-
 
 
We have a large area here and the soil assessment has not been defined in detail in the EIR [Environment Impact Report]

OVERVIEW OF PLANNING-RELATED ACTIVITIES IN THE LARGER BAYVIEW AREA
 
- 
Informational presentation
 by Department and other agency staff summarizing various planning-related activities in and near the Bayview District. This is an informational item only, no action is being requested of the Commission.




SPEAKERS


Supervisor Sophie Maxwell


-  Welcome to the Bayview.  it is really an honor that you are here and so much is going to be discussed today.


-  I just wanted to talk about my involvement with one of the issues that you are going to discuss today -- and that is the distribution of PDR.


-  Because I worked on this for the last 7 to 10 years, the reason I believe that we need to have a good balance in the City is because if we do not have a place for people to work and have decent jobs.  But still they will not be able to afford the housing whether it is affordable or not.


-  Yesterday we had a special meeting of the Land Use Committee where we discussed the Octavia project and we were given an economic picture from the Controllers Office.


-  One of the things they said that we found very shocking is that as we do the Octavia Plan we are going to be displacing middle income jobs and replacing those median income jobs with lower income jobs because you will be removing some of the infrastructure that produces those kind of jobs -- the back door jobs that you do not often see.


-  For me, the PDR piece is very important.  Housing is important but we've got to make sure to balance it because the housing we build, people will not be able to afford it if there are no jobs.


-  We need blue collar jobs.  As you deliberate on this I hope you will consider balance and I hope that you will consider the kind of San Francisco that we are going to have.


-  If we are going to be diverse in other than just food, then we are going to have to really make a decision here.


-  This is extremely important.  This is an area of San Francisco where individuals have a little plot of land and think that they are going to be able to be a millionaire because they sell it.


-  When you have industrial land you do not buy it for that.  You buy for what you can or plan to put on it and not for the land itself.


-  It is important for those people to understand that.  I believe that the Board of Supervisors is committed to that.  We have shown over and over and over again that we want to make sure that people have jobs.


-  Again, I thank you for being here and thank all the agencies that are coming here today to give an overview of what is happening in the Bayview because this is not isolated and of course none of your decisions can be made that way.


Fred Blackwell, Director of Redevelopment Agency


-  I just want to introduce myself and talk about the priorities of the Agency.


-  We do a lot of work with you and do it in various parts of the City like Mission Bay, Transbay, South Beach and Yerba Buena Gardens.


-  There are two very important priorities that we have as an agency: The Western Addition and getting off on the right foot at Bayview Hunters Point.


-  We have learned a lot from the work in The Western Addition.  There has been some good work as well as mistakes.  And we are working to not repeat those mistakes.


-  Redevelopment is not just about a place but it's about people and investing in the community in a way that benefit the people who live through the years.


-  With that spirit, you will see the presentation and we hope to work with you in our work of getting off at the Bayview.


Lisa Zayas-Chien, Project Manager for the New Bay View Hunter's Point Project - Redevelopment Agency


-  This is an existing neighborhood and people.  We did not need to recreate the wheel.


-  Our staff are working together to make sure that we are filling both of our responsibilities, according to delegation agreement.


-  You are not just acting on changing the Planning Code but also setting controls for the future of this development plan.


-  The Agency's largest role in the Bayview is really being a founder for the things that need to happen in this neighborhood.  Affordable housing is very high on that list.


-  
Affordable Housing Program:


-     Commitment of 50-percent of all tax increment funds that come to the Agency provides at least 25 percent affordable housing from all hosing production.


-     Maximum income levels would be 50 percent of median income.


-     We have to work closely together to track the inclusionary projects because you are entitling it but we have to make sure that they are abiding by the income limits.


-     We provide preferences for the Agency's certificate holders and projects based on subsidized Section 8.


-  We have four different affordable housing projects that are either almost complete or about to under go construction in Bayview that would provide over 400 units of affordable housing and over $20 million of agency subsidy.


-  We are working on a model block program that is basically looking at one residential block at a time and providing low interest rehabilitation bonds to the residents of that block.


-  With that one block we would also be focusing on developing streetscape improvements.


-  
Economic and Work-Force Development Program:


-     The Bayview Business Resource Center provides day to day assistance to small businesses.


-     Young Community Developers provides job training assistance to local youth as well as adults to help them prepare for jobs.


-     One of the intentions of our plan is to bring more resources to this effort.


-     We really need to work with our sister agencies like the Major's Office of Community Development and the Major's Office Economic Work-Force Development Program to make sure that we have a holistic strategy for commercial revitalization in the Bayview.


-  We have spent many months with our advisory body - Bayview Hunters Point Project Area Committee in reviewing an employment and contracting policy.  This requires close collaboration with the Planning Department.


-  We are anticipating coming to the Commission in about a month.


-  
Community Enhancement:


-     The use of tax funds are for streetscape improvements as well as improvements to the neighborhood through the provisions of community facilities.


-     The Agency is committed to using its funds to help in terms of streetscape and making sure that those buffer zones on the street are improved and help in the transition of industrial to residential.


-  Asian Campus and South East Health Center are the types of community facility projects that we need to pay special attention to and make sure we foster them in the future.


Amy Cohen, Major's Office Economic and Work-Force Development


-
 
 
One of the programs that we run is called the Neighborhood Market Place Initiative.  It is a commercial corridor revitalization and stabilization program.


-
 
 
We have 8 different commercial districts that we target, including Third Street in the Bayview.


-
 
 
It is a comprehensive community initiated planning process that has some resources from us around staffing.


-
 
 
The goal of the program is to bring stakeholders together around commercial districts to improve them and stabilize them to make them more vibrant places.


-
 
 
We have been doing this work in the Bayview since 2004 and began coordinating area agency work groups that includes all different City agencies that are sort of relevant to Third Street commercial revitalization work.


-
 
 
That work group is monthly and that is something that had not been done.


-
 
 
Another initiative is the grocery store.  There are some neighborhoods that are underserved.


-
 
 
The Bayview has been a big target for us and we have been working to improve what is here and also trying to bring in new grocery stores.  We have made a lot of progress on this.


-
 
 
We have a Third Street Corridor Program and a manager to work with merchants and property owners in making promotional activities and help businesses survive in this area.


-
 
 
We work with the Department of the Environment which has a farmer's market.


-
 
 
A couple of other aspects of our commercial revitalization program are business attraction and the Opera House in looking for short and long term solutions for various situations with it.


Chris Iglesias, Director of City Build


-  We have grown and have different branches.  One of the most well known is the City Build Academy.


-  One of our main tools in working with Planning is the City's First Source Hiring Program that has been around for several years.


-  We have placed over 500 people over the past two years on construction projects throughout the City and the region.


-  The Academy is located in the Bayview area right off Evans Street at the City College.


-  We have had 5 classes with the Academy and graduated about 192 people and placed about 169 in various construction jobs throughout the City, and not just on city projects but in a lot of private ones.


Francisco Da Costa


-  One of the things that we need in this area is an economic analysis that incorporates the need/impacts of career training in the area.


-  If you look into quality life issues, we need to address the environment.


[Inaudible]


-  We are very encouraged by having Mr. Blackwell as the new head of the Redevelopment Agency.


-  We want the right of self determination in this community and realtors need to be included in this process as well as improve notification to the community.


 
Oscar James


-  Our community was rezoned about 10 years ago and we do not need it again.  What we need is jobs and employment.


-  City Build trains a lot of people in the community and in the City at large.


-  Notification needs to improve.  Next time you have something out here put it in the mail and let us know.


Maury Tybo


-  City Build has a program and I question how they monitor the students while on the job training because I participated in it and have not seen anybody coming to monitor that.


Tony Kelly


-  Invited the Commission to spend more time in the Eastern Neighborhoods and the Bayview.


-  Proactive outreach needs to be one of the next steps for the Redevelopment Plan to move forward.


-  We did not hear about outcomes or goals in specific numbers on the various programs because without it in writing it becomes nothing.  We need to reward people for staying.


Ashley Rods


-
 
 
Speaking on behalf on the young people in this community to have an opportunity to be employed and be able to afford buying a home.


-
 
 
This is a great chance and opportunity to fare well in our community.


Dr. Arelious Walker, African American Revitalization Consortium


-
 
 
There are many needs in this community.  But the two strong predominant needs are housing and employment.


-
 
 
Dust itself does not create or cause long term health risks.  That is a final conclusion of the experts.


Ace Washington


-
 
 
Requested to have this kind of meeting in the Western Addition because the Redevelopment Agency is planning to leave with an unfinished agenda.


-
 
 
Something like this magnitude should have been promoted to the extreme and outreached to the community.


Linda


-
 
 
We've gotten to the point that we have a number of projects in the pipeline.  We've been waiting for ten years for the revitalization of Bayview and hope that they get implemented soon.


-  We welcome you and hope to see you more often.


Jerrold


-
 
 
I welcome you to our community and you have a great opportunity to work with us.


-
 
 
I support anything that helps our community.


Espanola Jackson


-
 
 
Thanked the Commission for coming to the community.  For the last two months the plan was in process and I made announcements at meetings that you were coming.


-
 
 
I am concerned with anything that is going to be built in this area -- especially those on the land field -- and want to make sure that what is being built will not be under water in five years.


Allen


-
 
 
I like everything that you have and hope you keep an open mind.  If we see that it is not working, we can come back before you and ask for amendments.


-
 
 
Appreciated diligence in meeting with the community and don't take long to come back.


Pastor Joshia


-
 
 
I am sick of having meetings after meetings and nothing happens.  We want to see some action and have this project start to be developed and give opportunities to the young people.

BAYVIEW HUNTERS POINT AREA PLAN RELATED TO PLANNING CODE AND MAP AMENDMENTS.
  The Planning Commission will consider adopting Planning Code and Map Amendments of the City and County of San Francisco according to the provisions of Sections 302 and 306.3 of the Planning Coderelated to the creation of new Industrial Use Districts in Bayview Hunters Point.  The new zoning would encompass the following areas: (1) the area generally bounded by Cesar Chavez Street, Bayshore Boulevard, Jerrold Avenue, Barneveld Avenue, McKinnon Avenue, Tolland Street, Evans Avenue, and Third Street; (2) the area generally bounded by Loomis Street, the I-280 Freeway, Oakdale Avenue, the Caltrain right-of-way, Evans Avenue, Toland Street, and McKinnon Avenue; (3) the area generally bounded by Bayshore Boulevard, Paul Avenue, Egbert Avenue, Hawes Street, Yosemite Slough, the Hunters Point Shipyard, Thomas Avenue, Jennings Street, Van Dyke Avenue, Williams Avenue and Phelps Street.  The Planning Commission certified the Bayview Hunters Point Plan Environmental Impact Report, adopted CEQA Finding, and adopted the Bayview Hunters Point Area Plan, an amendment to the General Plan, on March 2, 2006 with Motion Nos. 17200, 17201, and Resolution No. 17202 respectively.  These Zoning Text and Map Amendments would implement various objectives from the Bayview Hunters Point Area Plan that seek to retain space for jobs and light industrial activities and to reduce land use conflicts between housing and industry in the Bayview.

Adoption of a Planning Code Text Amendment
 
- 
Consideration of a resolution to adopt an amendment to the Planning Code, including adding Sections 121.5, 121.7, 210.7, 210.8, 210.9, 230, and 249.32; and amending Sections 204.3, 204.4, 210, 210.6, and 213.
   The amendment would establish a PDR-1 (Light Industrial Buffer) District, a PDR-2 (Production, Distribution, and Repair) District,  and a South Basin Design and Development Special Use District (South Basin SUD) .  The Amendments would also amend provisions related to uses, and add provisions related to use size, subdivision of lots, and demolition of industrial related structures.  These provisions would, in part, support and encourage a wide range of light industrial activities, restrict residential development, and limit the size of retail and office uses in the new use districts.  Provisions related to the South Basin SUD would further encourage and accommodate a mix of arts, product testing and development, telecommunications support, office, business services, and light industrial activities. 


Preliminary Recommendation:  Approve the resolution amending the Planning Code.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of September 20, 2007)




SPEAKERS


Jon Lau, Supervisor Maxwell's Office


-
 
 
Much is happening along the Third Street corridor in terms of supporting economic development.


-
 
 
There are substantial efforts that your own department staff will be collaborating with the Agency on -- maybe modifications to neighborhood commercial zoning and supporting the goals of economic development, greenery and affordable housing.


-
 
 
This is only one piece of a broader set of work.  Essentially it is to replace the current M-1 and M-2 designations with more modernized PDR districts.


-
 
 
Nobody has suggesting that this zoning action before you is a silver bullet for unemployment loss in the neighborhood, but it is clear that the retention of these areas is still important for the businesses located there and the jobs they support.


-
 
 
It is important to preserve the opportunity for these businesses to stay and grow in San Francisco.


-
 
 
The proposal is also to improve the quality of the neighborhood by placing limitations on some of the heavy industrial operations, size restrictions and buffer mechanisms to create physical separation between existing residential neighborhoods and active employment zones.


-
 
 
This has been a topic of community dialogue for many years now.


Francisco Da Costa


-
 
 
Over 20 workshops were held in this room and the deliberations are not reflected in this action item.  This is politics and it favors big developers who have failed this community.


Michael Hamman


-
 
 
Small businesses will be driven out if they are not protected and the consequences will be countless losses in case of an earthquake with industrials out of the City.


Eva Kruekel


-  [Read a written statement from Bob Legalet supporting the proposed zoning to stabilize properties of light industrial users.]


Benji Robinson


-
 
 
The new PDR narrows the possible tenants and users that can come in the Bayview and the language now is workable but not perfect.


-
 
 
Move forward with the proposed zoning to begin working.


Dr. Arelious Walker


-
 
 
Another objective with this item is to produce housing and also job expansion.


-
 
 
I am in support of this item and we'll make adjustments as needed.


Patrick Bartlett


-
 
 
Asked the Commission to postponed and reconsider adoption of the plan amendments of the Bayview until the land use area in the immediate proximity to the proposed green spaces are no longer classified as PDR Light Industrial.


-
 
 
The plan offers inadequate buffer at the boundaries of open spaces and the basin and we are proposing that it should be modified to accommodate residential and commercial mixed use.


Pual O'Brady


-
 
 
The community property owners know very little about this plan.


-
 
 
The residents of the Hunters Point Bayview will be encompassed by a ball and chain of commercial blight as a gateway to their homes.


-
 
 
Consider flexibility to this plan as we move forward.


Rev. Arnold Townsend


-
 
 
PDR is necessary but I think that having it along Third Street is flawed.


-
 
 
You need continuous commercial streams to make the area viable.


-
 
 
You need to take a look at the work of the Task Force on PDR.  Right now if it is diverse and groups in the community that put [together] the agenda for the Bayview and we do not know them.


Espanola Jackson


-
 
 
I oppose any rezoning or re-mapping of the Hunters Point.  It would move people out of this community because housing is going to be very expensive.


-
 
 
I urge you to not vote on this today and get more information.  We do not need PDR in this area.


Tony Kelly


-
 
 
There is a lot of work that still needs to be done on the Housing Element portion of this plan.


-
 
 
I would like to hear more details from the Redevelopment and Planning about how the Arts Element could be advanced with this plan.


Pauline Peel


-
 
 
I totally support small businesses because we need them in the area and I hope it gets approved tonight.

Adoption of a Zoning Map Amendment
 
- Consideration of a resolution to adopt an amendment to the Zoning Map.
  The amendment consists of revisions to Sectional Maps 8, 9, 10, and 10 SU of the Zoning Map of the City and County of San Francisco.  This amendment would: 1) reclassify the area generally bounded by Cesar Chavez Street, Barneveld Avenue, McKinnon Avenue, Evans Avenue, and Third Street from M-2 to PDR-2; 2) reclassify the area generally bounded by Loomis Street, the I-280 Freeway, Oakdale Avenue, and the Caltrain right-of-way from M-1 (Light Industrial) to PDR-2 (Production, Distribution, and Repair); 3) reclassify much of the South Basin District, generally bounded by Bayshore Boulevard, Paul Avenue, Egbert Yosemite Slough, the Hunters Point Shipyard, Thomas Avenue, and Williams Avenue, from M-1 to PDR-2; 4) establish a PDR-1 (Light Industrial Buffer) designation over the northern and southern edges of the South Basin District, on the east side of Third Street, roughly along Fitzgerald, Van Dyke, Underwood, and Thomas Avenues – on properties currently zoned M-1; and 5) apply the South Basin SUD (South Basin Design and Development Special Use District) to the area generally bounded by Paul Avenue, Bayshore Boulevard, Phelps Street, Williams Avenue, and Third Street. 


Preliminary Recommendation:  Approve the resolution amending the Zoning Map.
