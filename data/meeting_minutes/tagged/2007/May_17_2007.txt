Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 Thanked City Attorney, Susan Cleveland-Knowles, for the discussion on an item that I brought up last week regarding Senate Bill 1818 – 2005.


-
 
 Basically, it deals with changes in density bonus law.


-
 
 Sponsor gets height density bonus when the City asks to increase affordability on developments.


-
 
 I wanted to know what the position of the City is and I understand that City Attorney is going to prepare a written response in the future.


-
 
 I received a pro-forma from a builder in regards of a large project proposed [178 units] that probably would not go forward because of cost.


-
 
 It hast a lot of details, shows a return of 13 percent, and it does not include any proposed fee for infrastructure.


-
 
 It is really helpful when we see these things and we can pencil out the land and construction cost, permits, school and inclusionary fees.


-
 
 Reflecting on the cost of units; this might be the main reason why we are a high cost city in terms of housing.


Commissioner Moore


-
 
 Acknowledged Secretary Avery for putting together the Planning Commission Action List.


-
 
 The first item is for a presentation by AIA scheduled for June 28.


-
 
 It would be very timely for our discussion on the Eastern Neighborhood in designing affordable and quality housing.


-
 
 Another item that has not been calendared and is very important is green design.
 
 We need a presentation by people who are really on top of the subject matter.


-
 
 There was a very interesting article in the New York Times, this morning.


-
 
 There is a coalition of about 16 cities world wide and five major banks, all interested in modernizing urban buildings and to cut down on urban energy and the release of heat and gas that leads to global warming.


-
 
 We are not part of the list of these 16 cities.


-
 
 I called Mayor's Office Task Force.
 
 They are preparing for the San Francisco Green Building legislation.
 
 I wanted to see if we could get an update and overview of what other cities are doing.


-
 
 I am asking for your support.


Commissioner Alexander


-
 
 Instructed Ms. Avery to calendar Green Building Item for us.


Commissioner Sugaya


-
 
 We received today a letter from the 
Historic
 Resource Preservation Fund Committee.


-
 
 I want a staff report on Economic and Work Force Development at the Mayor's Office.


-
 
 I would like to get an update on the funds.


-
 
 Where the grants went, what is left and what has been funded.


-
 
 Also, what kind of priorities is the Fund Committee under?


-
 
 The issue of this letter has to do with the continue support of the Department's survey/preservation program.


-
 
 I am still concerned over last week's Eureka Street historic resource analysis.


-
 
 The area is a potential historic district and the developer was able to get out.


-
 
 Why did the evaluation for the proposed project not include any potential impact to the district itself?


-
 
 This is my second request for a report on the San Francisco Healthy Development Measuring Tool.


Commissioner Alexander


-
 
 I would like to first get a report on that tool.
 
 After consider it, if necessary, we will schedule a hearing.


Commissioner Moore


-
 
 I attended a SPUR meeting yesterday on the Eastern Neighborhood - Transportation and Infrastructure Improvements with City Planning and I am very encouraged these items are being considered early as we requested.


-
 
 I hope all parties will pick up speed together on planning efforts.

 pursuant to Planning Code Section 209.3(h) to increase school enrollment and allow Lick-Wilmerding High School to convert the residential property at 31 Howth Street to part of the school facility, located in a RH-1 (Residential, House, One-Family) District, RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions


 


SPEAKERS


Howard


-
 
 The conditions are acceptable and Lick will pay the figure the Commission would impose.


-
 
 Due to special circumstances, fee should not be applied, or if it is going to be applied, it should be as minimal as possible.


Al Adam




Lick High School has been contributing to the public for 112 years.


Their public work has been a major part of the community.


42 percent of our families participate on flexible tuition.
 
 40 percent of our students come from parochial and public school, 14 percent are students of color.


It is a mix of students that you would not find in any other independent school.


We use our budget to do it this way.


If you find it necessary that we contribute to housing funds, we are requesting that they be applied as minimally as possible.




Pamela Mei




This school has been a tremendous neighbor.


I am a parent of children attending this school.




Barry Wong




The project is incredible for students.


The current parking problem in the area is compounded by construction at City College.


Lick is one of the greenest schools in the city.




Tom




Many students of San Francisco Unified School District [SFUSD] are served by Lick.


Flexible tuition also makes possible the attendance of many students.


Former Commissioner Toby Levine sent a letter to this Commission in support of this project and I have a copy of it.




Mike




I contribute to all school fees.


I am amazed with Planning suggesting school fees to add to the project.




Amy




If this is a city that wants to retain families, having good schools is a big component.


It is a great school and does many public benefits.


It is noted nationwide to be a green school.




Julia


-
 
 Lick is a very unique private high school that allows flexible tuition for many talented students.




Minimize the assessment fee as much as possible.




[Inaudible]


-
 
 I am a graduate of Lick and would not like money to be used in any areas other than scholarships and financial aid for children's education.


Linda




My daughter is a freshman at Lick School and receives flexible tuition.


I am so thankful having her at this school and participating in the community.




Laurie




I have two sons at Lick School.


Do not impose assessment fees so they can continue helping families and the community.




Andrew Smith


-
 
 Consider going the other way.
 
 Instead of charging fees on this permit provide a refund.


 


ACTION:
 
 Approved without a fee.


AYES:
 
 Antonini, W. Lee, Moore and Sugaya.

Request for
 
Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit Application No. 2006.1025.6052, proposing to convert an existing ground floor commercial dance studio in an existing three-story two-family dwelling over commercial space. The project is in a SLR (Service/Light Industrial/Residential) District and a 50-X Height and Bulk District.
 


Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the building permit application with conditions.


NOTE:
 
 On May 10, 2007, the Planning Commission considered one of the Discretionary Review (DR) requests filed against this project.
 
 Based on the conditions of agreement read into the record at the hearing, the Commission passed a motion of intent to take DR and approve the project imposing the agreed on conditions.
 
 The item is continued to May 17, 2007 to allow a public hearing and consideration of the second DR filed on the project.
 
 The vote was (+7 –0) for this action.


 


SPEAKERS


Jakkee Bryson, 2
nd
 Discretionary Review Requestor




I was alarmed to find out that another bar was going to be established in my neighborhood.


We have a classic case of placing the cart before the horse.


When I was married, my husband and I were going to start a mini theater.


Before we purchased, we took a tour and found out that the building had historic significance.


We did not go forward because I got divorced.


This is a very sleepy hollow [quiet] neighborhood.


The lack of parking is a big issue in this area.




-
 
 1350 Folsom Street is under construction and might be ready around this time next year.


-
 
 That project would have 134 single room units for formerly homeless people with no parking for the residents.




Business activities around the area are over by 7p.m.




-
 
 I am sorry that this project sponsor did not conduct an environmental impact report before planning this project.


-
 
 There would be so much noise with people around the business -- workers and smokers.




The operational hours for this would be from 12-noon to 2a.m.


There is going to be a lot of disturbances with this project.




Jeremy Paul, Project Sponsor Representative




The owner knows this neighborhood and the zoning.


It is a proper use for this district.


The current location cannot continue to be used.


This item was continued to accommodate the requestor's need.




-
 
 A lot of members of the neighborhood, wheelchair users, came to support this project at the last meeting and waited for about 8 hours.


-
 
 Changes were made through negotiation with Mr. Ochoa.
 
 And Mr. Miko addressed very important issues on night usage.




This requestor did not want to meet with us about issues.




 


ACTION:
 
 Took Discretionary Review and Approved imposing agreed upon conditions with a further modification to condition #12 - smoking room:


 
 -It is to be ventilated with a well-maintained, adequately sized and quiet filtration system that removes smoke products from the air prior to exhausting to the atmosphere.

SPEAKERS


Kathleen Walsh, Discretionary Review Requestor




After last hearing, the architect proposed a revision of the third floor design.




-
 
 I filed the request, as I've stated every time I come to this Commission, on behalf of my neighbors.




Mr. Panteleoni provided a copy of these plans for review.


Some of my neighbors have not had the opportunity to review these plans.


Appreciated the effort and creativity to modify the project.


The third floor addition would stick out and be completely out of context with the homes around it.


It would destroy the symmetry of this block.


Thanked the Commission for listening to our concerns.




Terry Gaynor




Mr. Panteleoni reviewed the plans and submitted a copy of it.


[Shared photos of the area.]


We set up a pole to represent the silhouette of the proposed third-floor addition.


It is way above anything around us.




Lisa Walsh


-
 
 I think the project sponsor could achieve a very substantial house by adding a modified third floor.




West Portal was called a village before and people want to see that preserved.




-
 
 [Shared photo of a property with a third-floor addition that blocks sunlight on adjacent property.]


John Singleton




This is the fourth time we are in front of this Commission about this project.


Basically, the plan is still the same.




-
 
 [Shared/submitted photos showing how this project would be too high compared to the rest of the properties.]


Paul




Opposed to the project.


It is not a reasonable expansion for its square footage.


The roofline would be towering over the adjacent house.




-
 
 This is going to set a dangerous precedent and create a lack of balance in symmetry for this neighborhood.


Antonette




I agree with my neighbor's comments.




Mrs. Sanson




My concern is the precedence set with this project.


Parking, density and traffic is currently difficult.




Sandra




This addition would lack the charm of our neighborhood.


They should be able to expand but not add the second floor.




Tony Panteleoni, Project Sponsor Representative




We had a meeting with neighbors and tried to find some alternatives.


I met with some of the neighbors on May 5
th
.




-
 
 We proposed to remove the entire roof of the project and slope it from the street towards the rear of the property.


-
 
 On the drawings, the second bottom line shows the currant house.
 
 We changed the pitch of the roof further back.




The neighbors are concerned with the perceived image of the third floor.


Comparing this roof with the one on 61 Madrone Street, this project is smaller.




-
 
 The intent is to paint the house with a light color to have reflected light into Mrs. Walsh's house and dining area.


Joel Yodowitz, On behalf of Project Sponsor




One issue is the compatibility of the project.


The presentation by Mr. Panteleoni shows that there are existing houses that are as tall.


Another issue is the impact on Mrs. Walsh's house.


There is already a 6-foot separation from the north side of her house and the south side of the project.


View is not an issue because it is not legally protected in discretionary reviews.


There is going to be minimum light impact on her house.




-
 
 We are trying to bring this project into compatibility by increasing the house to an acceptable average size - nothing extraordinary.


Jim Keith




I support this project.


You should support larger family homes in this area.


Mr. Panteleoni has done a great job to minimize the impacts.

SPEAKERS


Ruby Smith


-
 
 I am totally amazed about this memorandum and the impact it's going to have on developments that are in the process.




Restricting housing developments would make property values higher.




Eugene Pak




This procedure is not protecting people who have already started a process in Planning.


Imposing fees retroactively would have a great impact on the cost of developments.


Lenders are part of the process and they could pull back.




Brett Gladstone


-
 
 I am here to propose that the grandfather date applies as follows: that those properties that apply after the date of the new ordinance be effective by the new ordinance.




As a legal professional, we are hired to advise on existing law.




-
 
 Developers have no idea the risks they're taking when buying in this area and how they are affected by the 2660 Harrison decision.


-
 
 That decision told them for the first that they would be subject to extensive environmental reviews and fees.




It does not inform people that community impact fees would be per square foot.




-
 
 Instruct staff and economist looking into what the fees should be considering property taxes and how to recapture them.


-
 
 You are requiring as policy that 40 percent of units be two or more bedrooms.
 
 You are actually cutting down the number of units and increasing the cost of construction.


-
 
 You may be helping the situation by relieving the density limitations but also heading the opposite way by increasing the size of units.




My clients are very concerned about how this process [community benefit fees] is unpredictable and affects their ability to do these developments.




 


Matthew Brennan




Reliance is taught the first year of law school.




-
 
 It basically says that before purchasing a project to develop, punch all the numbers - price, development cost, fees [attorney, architect, engineer, city].




Changing the law retroactively adversely affects all the projects in process.




Keely Ferguson




I work with buyers/sellers of land sites throughout the development process.




-
 
 Part of my job is to analyze development sites and accurately disclose possibilities/cost to build.


-
 
 We follow policies and codes, especially Planning Commission Resolution #16727 when giving advise to clients on sites in the Eastern Neighborhoods.




My clients have projects in the pipeline in these neighborhoods.


Imposing new community fees retroactively seems to be unfair and unethical.


Community impact fees were not mentioned in resolution 16727 and a lot of people rely on this document.




Josh Nasvik




We bring deals with clients involving the development of 2 units to 400 units.




-
 
 We look at agendas, minutes and resolutions when recommending to our clients what they can build.




He urged the commission not do impose retroactive fees.




James Nunemacker




I agreed with all previous speakers.


The biggest concern is public trust given to the Commission.


It is fine to make new rules but they should be put forward and implemented fairly.




Colleen Coter


-
 
 I work with many developers and have been closely monitoring the process since the adoption of resolution 16727.


-
 
 This resolution does not make any reference to community fees and changing the rules later is unfair.




The Commission was encouraged to consider costs when grandfathering projects.




Mark Brennan


-
 
 Local developers follow the rules and changing those rules in the middle of a process would [negatively] impact San Francisco.




Do not to impose fees on projects that have been in the process for three or four years.




Michael




It is extremely important to make rules clear.


It could potentially jeopardize small projects.


Clarify the difference between community impacts and public benefits.




Lauren Ladd




It is incredible to be here today facing a prospect of owner's [becoming subject to] community impact fees.




-
 
 It seems that this body should concern itself with the climate of tenuous regulatory [policies] and the uncertainty that plagues our city.


-
 
 The reasonable expectations that resolution 16727 engendered included no addition of community fees or a grandfather provision.


-
 
 Shared his experience with a client that went through the process with hearing presentations and all with no mention of community fees.


Gary Gee


-
 
 Read a letter sent in opposition to any proposal by the Planning Commission to apply new community or development fees retroactively.


Ger O'Keeffe




Construction costs have increased up to 100 percent.


The affordability components have gone up to huge percentages.


Projects in the pipeline cannot absorb community fees.


Do not impose these fees on projects in the pipeline.




Brian McGee


-
 
 It seems that every time we come to the Commission it is to talk about fees and not projects.




These fees imply negative impacts on developments in the city.




-
 
 It does not make any sense since we are not using the streets and landscape continuously throughout the year, every body is.


-
 
 Urged the Commission to consider the cost of the fees and at the very least to have a grandfather clause that protects the projects in the pipeline.


Joe Cassidy


-
 
 Every week since last November, the construction industry has been under attack either at this Commission or at the Board of Supervisors.




Developers are already paying fees everywhere.


We need to get these projects moving.




John O'Connor




Applying fees without a nexus study violates the California Fee Mitigation Act.


I came to Planning and received a document and submitted a plan.




-
 
 Interest rates have increased 17 times and construction costs went up 100 percent in eight months.




Grandfather projects that have been submitted before today.




Louis Rarano




The development impact fee proposed is unfair to all small builders.


It usually takes at least 2 to 3 years to get a project approved.


The costs for construction and material are rising all the time.


This proposal would increase costs anywhere from $10 to $20 a square foot.


The Commission and the Planning Department should focus on density bonus.




-
 
 Keep in mind that projects in the pipeline are not moving at all because of the Eastern Neighborhood debacle.


-
 
 These developments would provide affordable hosing with no cost to the City it they are allowed to move ahead.


Richie Hart




We play by the rules but they keep changing.


It is important to keep fairness in this process.


Talk to an attorney before making any decision.




Fergus O'Sullivan


-
 
 We all are nervous for waiting a long time to develop and then unexpectedly this community impact comes along.


-
 
 The developers here today are part of the city and they work hard to keep affordable housing in San Francisco.




It is very important that we look after local and small builders.


You need to take a step back and realize that these fees are unrealistic.


The grandfather issue is the key issue today.




Stephen McElroy




We are here to protest this anti-business and inflation ambiance.


These procedures would be responsible for making housing less affordable.


At the very least, grandfather in the pipeline projects.




Grace Shanahan




My main concern is the subject of grandfathering.




-
 
 Read a memorandum prepared by Director Macris [page 5] about the grandfather clause to protect projects in the pipeline.




We respect the rules and system and endeavor to work with them.




Kieran Buckley




I completely oppose these new fees.


The costs have gone up and this fee is going to cut down the supply of affordable housing.


Projects in the pipeline should at least be grandfathered.




David O'Keeffe




I want to focus on impact fees and the need for extra money.


There are fees that impact us as well [mortgages, taxes, etc.]


There has been a lot of talk about affordability component and that San Francisco is a very expensive city to live in.


Builders would have to pay fees now that eventually would affect homeowners.




Angus McCarthy




It is important to look at the role of what Commissioners what to do.




-
 
 You have the power to honor the system you have in place along with the Planning Department.




What we are doing is to commit and build this community.


You must keep our industry alive.




Mike Cassidy




This is another illegal action of the Planning Department.


We follow the law and this is not being done well.


If the 49ers want to come and play in San Francisco they have to pay too.


The difference is that they are being told now, but for us is at the last minute.




John Pollard


-
 
 It is ironic that the Contract State License Board says that we have to give a fixed price for every project we do.




It we do not provide it, we would be prosecuted.




-
 
 In other industries in the State of California you would have to comply by giving cost within one percent.




Reject impact fees.




Charles Breidinger




Any time you make a business transaction, you are in partnership with the government.




-
 
 A lot of problems in the city come from the unbalance of downtown office developments versus the amount of housing available.




This has a definite impact on the environment and air pollution.




-
 
 I would like to know how the figures were done to come up with an impact fee of $13 a square foot for housing and $4 a square foot for commercial.




The impact fee should be the opposite - $13 for commercial and $4 for housing.




-
 
 Imposing fees would reduce the value of land in the Eastern Neighborhoods, which would have a very large economic impact.


[Unidentified]




We need more affordable housing for families in the Mission District.


Because of this fee, we could loose our jobs.




Seamys Canning




This fee is very unfair and would increase the value of housing.


Fees should be spread across the projects in the City.




Paul Troudelius


-
 
 The City Attorney's Office advised that you conduct a nexus study program to build projects in the Eastern Neighborhood.


-
 
 In the State of California you cannot apply an assessment fee or tax without showing how the money is going to be spent.
 
 It was not done.




There is no question that these projects in the pipeline need to be grandfathered.




Redmond Ryons




I can make this very simple in a practical manner.


It is just like asking my wife for a pre-nuptial agreement.




 


 


Leo Cassidy


-
 
 It is hard to believe that this Department does not consider a grandfather clause for projects in process for three years.




At the Board of Supervisors two weeks ago, the legislation was approved reducing the fee for downtown affordable housing from 15 to 12 percent.




Jim Keith




There are good things that need to be done with the impact fee money.


This fee needs to be paid equitably.


Developments would not move forward with this new fee.


The matter has been stressed to grant a grandfather clause for pipeline projects.




Julie Leadbetter




I do not think you should grandfather these projects.


Developers are not willing to build affordable housing.


They should speak to the community and be concerned with neighborhood needs.




Nick Pagaulatos




We have heard a lot about predictability and rules but we have not heard about justice.




-
 
 The Planning Department has acknowledged that all market-rate projects have had a negative impact in our community.




We have been waiting for six years for this zoning plan to finally take place.


You should not approve projects until we have the rezoning in place.




Kim




There is a Draft Mission Neighborhood Plan on the Planning Department website.


Public comments are due on May 30.




-
 
 Why are you considering these projects and why are they on the agenda if the plan is in process?


Jerry




Builders bring housing to the community and tax revenues to the city.


When we produce market rate housing we have made contributions to affordable housing.




-
 
 Housing rates have increased in San Francisco, while everywhere else in the country they are reducing.


Sean Keighran




We have heard the arguments of legally and ethically imposing fees retroactively.




-
 
 Our organization had representatives at each of the seven Planning hearings that lead to the adoption of resolution 16727.




We are very familiar with these rules and fee structure.


The rules are changing and it is wrong to do it in the middle of the game.


Why not sit down and work in partnership to compile a specific list to prioritized needs?




Alice Barkley


-
 
 Today's discussion points to the failure of this Department to plan for the past ten years.




No piece of property or lot is bought without knowing what you can do with it.


I have serious doubts of the legality of how the impact fees are being proposed.




-
 
 Your Department did not assign projects to staff for 24 months in the Eastern Neighborhoods.

At the beginning of the hearing, the Commission considered a continuance of items 15 and 16 because the "Proposed Continuance" language should have been deleted prior to the posting and distribution of the calendar.


 


SPEAKERS REGARDING CONSIDERATION OF CONTINUANCE:


Alice Barkley – Representing the Project Sponsor


-
 
 When an item is proposed for continuance the practice has been that the Commission could decide whether to hold the hearing or not.


-
 
 The Project Sponsor objects to the continuance of this project.


John O'Connell, Architect

 I would like the project to be presented today.


-
 
 It has been continued several times already.


Julie Leadbetter


-
 
 The public is here to comment of this project.


-
 
 We would request that you not make a decision today.


-
 
 Our conversation with the Project Sponsor just started and we would like to continue it.


Kim, Discretionary Review Requestor


-
 
 Supports the idea to hear public comment today.


-
 
 We initially requested continuance to June.
 
 It would have helped to facilitate comments.


 


After the public was allowed to comment on the consideration of continuance, it was decided to hold the public hearing without taking action today.

Appeal of Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration
.
 
 The proposed project would include demolition of an existing building and construction of a five-story, 50-foot-tall mixed-use building totaling approximately 22,662 square feet.
 
 The building would include nine dwelling units, nine parking spaces and one commercial unit.
 
 Vehicular access to the garage would be via 18
th

 The project site in the Valencia Neighborhood Commercial zoning district and is within a 50-X height and bulk district.
 
 The project site is in the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan Area and is subject to the Housing/Mixed Use Guidelines.

SPEAKERS


Julie Leadbetter, Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition - Appellant


-
 
 In addition to socio-economic, there are also cumulative impacts to the physical environment.




We submitted documents to the Planning Department and this Commission.


The California Environmental Quality Act [CEQA] referred to these elements as necessary to an adequate discussion of accumulative impacts:




List of projects producing related impacts including projects outside the control of the agency.


Summary of the expected environmental impacts to be produced by those projects.


Reasonable analysis of the cumulative impact from those related projects.








-
 
 This Commission has the duty to use its best efforts to find out and disclose all they reasonably can about other projects in the area.


-
 
 The department speaks only about three projects but there are seven to eight projects in the pipeline in this area.


-
 
 Land use, esthetics, cultural resources, transportation, circulation and air quality would be impacted with all these projects.


-
 
 We need to have some more discussion on the PDR changes from auto/commercial to residential because it would have cumulative impacts.




The height would create a significant impact on the existing neighborhood character.




-
 
 The senior building between 17
th
 and 18
th
 Streets and The Women's Building have height bonus in exchange of social-economy resources for the neighborhood.


-
 
 The proposed project would substantially degrade the existing visual character of a significant historical resource.
 
 [The Women's Building]


-
 
 The City designated The Women's Center as a landmark.
 
 The proposed project would block the mural.


-
 
 The visual connection between Mission Street and The Women's Building is a scenic public setting.


Rachel Washburn




We have heard a lot about fairness and justice today.


Asked if it is fair that a building be taller above all other properties in the neighborhood?


Is it fair that my air quality be impacted with dust and contamination?


Supports the request for the discretionary review in order to better evaluate the impact.




-
 
 The negative declaration submitted by the project sponsor plans to mitigate dust at the construction site by sprinkling the site twice daily.




I would recommend that mitigation be looked at carefully.
 
 Perhaps, misting machines could be installed.


Consider building a three-story development to prevent obstructing the view of The Women's Building mural.




Alice Barkley, Representing the Project Sponsor

 Given the time and since the project is to be continued to June 7, we would like to wait and present it then.

SPEAKERS


Robert Bockelman, Discretionary Review Requestor


-
 
 The project being proposed is going to build out to the side spacing that exists through out the block.


-
 
 Section 101 of the General Plan says that existing housing and neighborhood character should be preserved and protected.


-
 
 The Residential Design Guidelines reads that side spacing between adjacent buildings is to be respect in order to keep the existing pattern.




The rear building on this lot is going to take away sunshine.


The construction is really big.
 
 It is a demolition and not an addition.




-
 
 If the side spacing is not respected, I would have to move my electric panel-meter and garbage because people would not have access to it.




If this project would be approved, it would violate ethic rules.


There is information about this project that is not accurate.


It was stated that the property is a two-story building and it is a one-story with garage.




-
 
 Addition would affect view of adjacent property -it takes away the view of four windows.


Ms. Carter




My backyard abuts to the backyard of the subject property.


I am going to loose the sunlight.




-
 
 A shadow study should be done throughout the year to ensure that there is going to be adequate sunlight.


-
 
 Although owners have the right to build and do what they please with their own property, it should not affect others.




I put solar panels on my building.


[Shared photos and drawings of what the project would look like when it is done.]




Melia




I submitted an email yesterday.


[Shared photos of surrounding area.]


San Francisco is loosing a lot of single home families.


The proposed project would take away sunlight.


Urged the Commission to consider open space for the neighborhood.




Dan Herber




The construction and excavation would affect my wife's health.


The new building would take away sunlight in the kitchen and hallways.




Simon Khuan, Architect for the Project




We started this process about two years ago.


The subject property is very small.




-
 
 In November 27, 2005, 145 notices were mailed.
 
 The notices expired and nobody contacted us.


-
 
 Starting in January 2006, we made several attempts to work with concerns from the requestor and had no response.




We met with the requestor in May last year and his only concern was his view.


This rendering shows the window and shadow that is not cast on the property.


We made changes to accommodate the need for garbage disposal.




Alba, Mr. Murphy's Representative




Mr. Murphy is a part owner of this property.


The property has been appropriately disclosed.


Mr. Murphy is not actively involved in this process.

SPEAKERS


Lisa Sunner, Project Sponsor


Divisadero Corridor Manager for the Neighborhood Market Place Initiative.


-
 
 Our goal is to create a strong neighborhood commercial corridor to make it a better place to live, work, shop and eat.


-
 
 During late 2005 and early 2006, my office facilitated three community meetings to ask the neighborhood what areas of Divisadero Street needed improvement.


-
 
 Opening the Department of Motor Vehicles [DMV] lot for public parking during nights and weekends was identified as one of the top issues.


-
 
 Participants believe that having more parking near the commercial corridor would greatly enhance the ability for customers to shop there.


-
 
 It would attract more people and help our neighborhood economically.


-
 
 We have received requests to use the DMV lot for public parking from City College.


-
 
 We have been working with DMV since 2004 to develop this idea of using the lot for public parking.




We received 207 responses to our survey and over 60 percent of those responding live within six blocks of DMV.


The majority of the responses were in favor of opening the lot.


Only six of those responding are opposed to this idea.


Many people support this project.


We would provide an attendant from 6pm to 2am everyday to provide security.


The DMV is committed to daily cleaning and regular maintenance of the parking lot.


Also, we are exploring the possibility of situating a space for car sharing organizations.




Regina Dick-Endrizzi, Supervisor Mirkarimi's Office




Supervisor Mirkarimi gives his unconditional support to the proposed project.


We are really happy that they are willing to work there.


Appreciated the help of the Mayor's Office of Work Force and Economic Development.


Requested support on granting the conditional use for 1377 Fell Street [DMV]




Ruth Carlton


-
 
 As a merchant on Divisadero Street, parking is the number one complaint from our customers.




The changes in the neighborhood have been wonderful with its nightlife area.


We are very concerned about our customer's safety.




-
 
 It would also help the residents of the neighborhood and take the pressure off when looking for parking.


Mark Duncan




I live across the street from the parking lot and I have a neutral part in this.


Usually cars will park there illegally.


This is a very good neighborhood and this parking lot is dark during the night.




-
 
 We do want to bring people to the area, but I wonder what is happening to the public transportation.




This would encourage more traffic and I am not sure we want to do that.




 


ACTION:

Public Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Report
. Assessor's Block 4058, Lot 10.
 
The 50,000 square foot project site is located on Third Street, between 19
th
 and 20
th
 Streets. The proposed project would preserve and renovate two existing historic buildings and construct three new buildings above a new below-grade parking podium. The project would contain approximately 242,185 square feet (sq.ft.), including about 179 residential units, a 5,262 sq.ft. restaurant space, 11,434 sq.ft. of retail space, a 2,393 sq.ft. day-care, a below-grade parking garage accessed from Illinois Street with about 157 parking spaces, 50 bicycle spaces, and two off-street loading spaces. The two new structures along Third Street would be 35 feet in height at the property line, and 50 feet in height beyond 0a 20-foot setback. The new building proposed on Illinois Street would range from 55 to 65 feet in height. The project site is located in an M-2 (Heavy Industrial) zoning district and a 50-X height and bulk district. The proposed project would require a 
General Plan
 amendment and rezoning to create a temporary "Central Waterfront Plan Demonstration District." This District would enact most of the controls proposed in the December 2002 
Draft Central Waterfront Plan'
s Mixed-Use Residential District, including increasing the existing height and bulk designation from 50-X to 65-X. The proposed project would require a conditional use authorization for a Planned Unit Development pursuant to Section 304 of the San Francisco 
Planning Code
.


Note: Written comments will be accepted at the Planning Department until the close of business on May 21, 2007


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Receive Comments. No action required.


 


SPEAKERS


Laura Roland, Carpenters Local 22




We have concerns about the adequacy of this document and project.




-
 
 We believe that it under minds the adequacy process of the Eastern Neighborhood Planning process.


-
 
 We are currently finalizing the details of our formal comments to be submitted by the deadline of May 26.


Michael




I think it is an excellent document and commended staff for the wonderful job done.


This Environmental Impact Review is a combination of four and a half year of process.


The application was submitted in December 2002 as a mitigated negative declaration.




-
 
 At the request of staff, the sponsor redesigned the project to increase its density to conform to the draft Central Waterfront Plan.


-
 
 We were prepared to publish another draft mitigated negative declaration in March 2006.


-
 
 In February 2006, the Board of Supervisors upheld the appeal for the 2660 Harrison Street project.


-
 
 We were asked to go back for the third time and we came up with this Draft Environmental Impact Report.




I just wanted to emphasize the history of the procedure.


[Quoted page 7 of the report.]




-
 
 Many people confuses the socio-economic affects and physical impacts under the California Environmental Quality Act [CEQA]

Initiation of Planning Code Amendments Establishing PDR Zoning Districts and Initiation of Zoning Map Amendments Applying these Designations to Certain Industrial Portions of Bayview Hunters Point
 
 - 
The Department is proposing a set of Code amendments to establish a PDR-1 (Light Industrial Buffer District) and a PDR-2 (Production, Distribution, and Repair District) in the Planning Code.
 
 
These zones will permit a wide variety of non-residential uses and will retain space for current and future light industrial activities.
 
 The Department is also proposing Zoning Map amendments that would apply these PDR Districts, and a South Basin Design and Development Special Use District, to certain industrial areas in Bayview Hunters Point currently zoned M-1 (Light Industrial) and M-2 (Heavy Industrial).
 
 These amendments would implement various objectives from the Bayview Hunters Point Area Plan, which seeks to retain space for jobs and light industrial activities and to reduce land use conflicts between housing and industry in the Bayview.
