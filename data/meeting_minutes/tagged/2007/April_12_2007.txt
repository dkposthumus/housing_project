Initiation of Planning Code Amendments Establishing PDR Zoning Districts and Initiation of Zoning Map Amendments Applying these Designations to Certain Industrial Portions of Bayview Hunters Point
 
 - 
The Department is proposing a set of Code amendments to establish a PDR-1 (Light Industrial Buffer District) and a PDR-2 (Production, Distribution, and Repair District) in the Planning Code.
 
 
These zones will permit a wide variety of non-residential uses and will retain space for current and future light industrial activities.
 
 The Department is also proposing Zoning Map amendments that would apply these PDR Districts, and a South Basin Design and Development Special Use District, to certain industrial areas in Bayview Hunters Point currently zoned M-1 (Light Industrial) and M-2 (Heavy Industrial).
 
 These amendments would implement various objectives from the Bayview Hunters Point Area Plan, which seeks to retain space for jobs and light industrial activities and to reduce land use conflicts between housing and industry in the Bayview.
 


 


A) 
Informational Item
.
 
 Staff will respond to Commissioner questions from the informational hearing held on January 18, 2007 and provide clarifying information.
 


Preliminary Recommendation:

 The amendment would establish a PDR-1 Use District (Light Industrial Buffer), a PDR-2 Use District (Production, Distribution, and Repair), and a South Basin Design and Development Special Use District (South Basin SUD), and establish regulations on subdivisions, accessory uses, and the demolition of industrial structures in these districts.
 


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Approve the resolution of intent to initiate the Planning Code amendment.


 


C) 
 
 
2006.0074Z – Initiation of a Zoning Map Amendment
.
 
 Consideration of a resolution of intent to initiate a Zoning Map amendment consisting of revisions to Sectional Maps 8, 9, 10, and 10 SU of the Zoning Map of the City and County of San Francisco.
 
 This amendment would: 1) reclassify the area generally bounded by Cesar Chavez Street, Barneveld Avenue, McKinnon Avenue, Evans Avenue, and Third Street from M-2 to PDR-2; 2) reclassify the area generally bounded by Loomis Street, the I-280 Freeway, Oakdale Avenue, and the Caltrain right-of-way from M-1 (Light Industrial) to PDR-2 (Production, Distribution, and Repair); 3) reclassify much of the South Basin District, generally bounded by Bayshore Boulevard, Paul Avenue, Egbert Yosemite Slough, the Hunters Point Shipyard, Thomas Avenue, and Williams Avenue Avenue, from M-1 to PDR-2; 4) establish a PDR-1 (Light Industrial Buffer) designation over the northern and southern edges of the South Basin District, on the east side of Third Street, roughly along Fitzgerald, Van Dyke, Underwood, and Thomas Avenues – on properties currently zoned M-1; and 5) apply the South Basin SUD (South Basin Design and Development Special Use District) to the area generally bounded by Paul Avenue, Bayshore Boulevard, Phelps Street, Williams Avenue, and Third Street.

Appeal of a Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration
 for the proposed construction of a four-story medical office building ( MOB ) on a 52,000 square foot portion of two surface parking lots on the northeast corner of the California Pacific Medical Center Davies campus in the Duboce Triangle neighborhood. The 50,100 (46,000 as measured by the Planning Code) gross-square-foot MOB would contain offices, a Neuromuscular and Electroencephalogram Clinic, a pharmacy and admitting station for the existing ambulatory surgery department in the CPMC Hospital North Tower. Patient drop-off would be located adjacent the MOB's third floor, accessible via the existing Duboce Avenue service drive. The MOB would include two pedestrian entries: a southern entrance along Noe Street and a northern entrance located along Duboce Avenue across from the N-Judah MUNI stop. The project would result in removal of 75 onsite surface parking spaces; no new off-street parking spaces would be constructed as part of the project. Pedestrian and streetscape improvements, including a public plaza, landscaping and sidewalk widening along Noe Street would be undertaken as part of the project. The project site is in the RH-3 (Residential House, Three Family) Zoning District and the 65-D Height and Bulk District, and would require Conditional Use authorization for expansion of an institutional use in an RH-3 Zoning District, an amendment CPMC's Planned Unit Development, permits from the Department of Public Works for tree removal and new landscaping, as well as building permits from the Department of Building Inspection.

Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 Thanked Zoning Administrator for a Memorandum about 766 Powell Street.


-
 
 It seems an interesting project that has been in process.


-
 
 It is interesting to have an input on approved projects before we were on the Commission.


Commissioner Olague


-
 
 I have a follow up on requested information about the Day Labor Program.


-
 
 It is becoming a controversial issue.


-
 
 Home Depot had some findings and their Attorney called me two months ago mentioning an agreement made to donate about $100,000 to the program.


-
 
 I spoke to La Raza Centro Legal, administrator of the Labor Program, and they were unfamiliar with this issue.


-
 
 They are in the process of opening a new location at Bayshore Boulevard.


-
 
 Since we will hear the 3400 Cesar Chavez project next week, I would like to have some update on what the Major' Office of Housing is doing with that program.


-
 
 I would like to understand if La Raza Centro Legal was part of that process and how money is going to be allocated.


Mr. Badiner, Zoning Administrator


-
 
 In your packets last week you received a memorandum about the Day Labor Program.


-
 
 It does not address the Home Depot issue but we will investigate that.


Commissioner W. Lee


-
 
 At the hearing last week, we had a discussion about zoning in the Market and Octavia Plan and whether it would be applicable for the Eastern and Mission Neighborhoods.


-
 
 If to be used, these neighborhoods need to be notification that we intend to use Neighborhood Commercial Transit [NCT] zoning and Resident Transit Oriented [RTO] zoning.


-
 
 I would like the Commission to know the dates of notification to these districts.


Mr. Badiner, Zoning Administrator


-
 
 I will make sure that the Citywide Division informs you of the dates of notification.


-
 
 Eastern and Mission District Plans are in the process for public notification.


-
 
 We do not yet have a formal proposal to present to citizens.


-
 
 Neighborhoods will be properly notified of any new zoning to be applied when we reach that time.


Commissioner Sugaya


-
 
 The American Planning Association had an article about the new LEED Neighborhood Developments proposal to apply LEED standards to planning.


-
 
 In another article I read, there is apparently some movement to revamp the scoring system because of complaints from different sectors on how some projects can be LEED certified.


-
 
 Apparently, there are some things that builders can do to score points.
 
 It seems that this is being looked at.
 
 The Department might want to move with some caution on this.


-
 
 Another article from one of my planning newsletters is about a study on transportation and walkability.


-
 
 An interesting statement is that the key to increase the number of walking trips is not to have amenities like benches, but for pedestrians to have somewhere to walk to and not to have a horrible environment.


-
 
 Another article I read is about San Francisco Healthy Development Measuring Tool on how to assess developments.


-
 
 It would be great to have a report on that too.


-
 
 A Report on Lloyd Crossing says that there is an intention to do green stuff to development areas.
 
 We could have applied it to Mission Bay because it [the article] extents to the infrastructure and the use of green water and wastewater.


Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 Regarding new rezoning on different parts of the city, it is important to involve the public from the very beginning of the proposals.


Commissioner Moore


-
 
 LEED Neighborhood Planning program is a pilot program.


-
 
 It is about green building guidelines to include public/neighborhood considerations with what I consider contextual design.


-
 
 I know somebody who practices in the city and is very knowledgeable about this fabulous program.
 
 We should invite him to do a presentation and make us aware of it.


Commissioner Olague


-
 
 We should have some information on this pilot program to help raise questions during the presentation of the Eastern Neighborhood Plan on April 26.


 




DIRECTOR'S REPORT

Director's Announcements




 


Mr. Badiner, Zoning Administrator


-
 
 Since we had the joint hearing with the Building Inspection Commission, we have met with the Director of Building Inspection twice and will continuing meeting biweekly and sooner if necessary.


-
 
 We have established a staff level coordination committee between the Fire Marshall, Building Inspection and Planning Department.


-
 
 Everybody convened together this Tuesday.


-
 
 We have some proposals on how to work together.


-
 
 Starting with a comprehensive pre-application project review process to bring Building Inspection and the Fire Marshall in early in the process when the project warrants it.


-
 
 To work on amending the application review process to identify conflicting areas of the Building, Planning and Fire Codes.


-
 
 Soliciting a plan for common code conflicts to discuss up-front.


-
 
 We are pursuing some of the ideas raised at the joint hearing with the Building Inspection Commission.

SPEAKERS


Mr. Fred Blackwell, Director, Major's Office of Community Development




The committee is broad and inclusive to represent our diverse community.


It started in April 2006 and has been diligent setting up accomplishments.


They have community involvement and participation on design matters.




-
 
 The combination of its Vision, Mission and Principles lays out a foundation for planning.




We would have community outreach this month.




-
 
 Challenges we could face are transitioning from planning to the implementation and coordination of funds for the community.


Jessie Collins, Chair of the Stabilization Fund


-
 
 A series of meetings are scheduled to engage the community in the process.




These are community funds and we intend to involve them.




Claudeen del Rosario, Major's Office of Community Development


-
 
 The Ordinance is laid out with protection from the use of these funds to supplement other agencies.




The priorities set for these funds consider areas not addressed by other city agencies.




Jim Meko




Thanked Ms. Collins for energy, skill and willingness to work in a collaborative effort.




-
 
 The Western Soma Task Force is working closely with the Advisory Committee developing a Business Service to share answers for stabilization and revitalization.

I have been involved with the Major's Office of Community Development through my job.


This is a real public process for planning.

Request that you limit the back yard and eliminate the deck.


This particular house is out of character with the middle of the block open space.


It would immediately close off air and light.

It is too large for this particular block.


Eliminating the deck and providing a set back would alleviate it.

Urged the Commission to deny the DR and uphold the permit as is.

 The seven feet we want to go out to is in the fully cemented area.
