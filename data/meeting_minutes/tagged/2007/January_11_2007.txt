Commissioner Antonini




Regarding the contest for possible design of tall buildings around the Transbay Terminal.


I've gotten a lot of calls asking what I think about that.


I am supportive of the competition.


I think in a larger sense, the idea toward density and height is a good one.


I think it ties in with environmental concerns; with a stoppage of urban sprawl; with a green philosophy where businesses are beginning to realize that many of their workers are living in dense urban areas and it behooves them to have their business closer to where the population base is.
 
 This would eliminate the need for people to drive long distances and would stop the spread of business and housing into rural lands or lands that were green areas.


To that regard, having buildings [against] your urban core, I think is a good thing.
 
 Whatever height these buildings should be is a matter of conjecture.
 
 The market place to a large degree will determine that.
 
 I think it is structurally very possible to anchor them to the degree that they are safe.


So I think this is an excellent concept.
 
 I think the skyline defines the city's profile to a large degree.
 
 I think it can be done in a tasteful manner and it can be something that can fit into San Francisco and can add to the diversity of density and the diversity of heights that we have throughout the city.


I'm interested in hearing more as the competition continues.




Commissioner Bill Lee




On January 2nd there was an article in the Examiner – 
Hollywood Again Shuns San Francisco After a Brief Film Revival


My question for the Commission is – the main issue with San Francisco is the production and film studio.
 
 What I would like to do is ask Stephanie Coyote to meet with the Planning Commission to go over what are our needs to do more filming in the city over the next 10 or 20 years.


I want to do this because when a film is done in San Francisco, it gives us free advertising.


Because we are in a global market here and we compete with other places, every film that is filmed here, like the Pursuit of Happiness, gives us something that people around the world sees.


So I would like to get a consensus of the Commission to ask Director Macris to sit down with Stephanie Coyote and put together what the city really needs to revive our film industry and have her present to us I think would be worthwhile as we're moving toward Treasure Island review and Hunter's Point and the Eastern Neighborhoods because we need a film studio.


Second, I'd like an interpretation from the City Attorney's Office.
 
 San Francisco State University – I've been receiving calls and emails about their expansion.
 
 I want to know if we have any jurisdiction at all since this is state property?


I'd like something in writing from the City Attorney's Office that tells us whether we have a role or no role.
 
 Whether this is a gray area or there are some areas that we maybe can look into.
 
 Something within the next month would be appreciated.


I'd also like to get from Parking and Traffic as we move forward regarding Market/Octavia, but also Eastern Neighborhoods, the number of registered cars and trucks that DMV has for San Francisco.


Finally, I think I asked this last year, we always have issues around liquor licenses – we have more liquor licenses in 45 square miles than all of Los Angeles County.
 
 If we could ask ABC how many liquor licenses are issued in San Francisco?
 
 How many different types of licenses there are?




Commissioner Sugaya




Would like to know from staff what kind of jurisdiction we have over these towers [Transbay].


I wasn't quite sure because there is a joint powers agreement with Transbay Terminal anyway and I don't know if Redevelopment is lurking around there or not, but would like a briefing on what our commission's role would be, if any.


Also, that extends to Treasure Island.
 
 That may be completely out of our jurisdiction, I don't know.
 
 But I would like a briefing on that also.


With respect to the ballpark, the Mayor seems to think he's going to plop a new ballpark down on a different site, do we have any say so?
 
 Is that going to come before us at some point?
 
 What is the role of the commission in that?


Mr. Badiner, if you could check with preservation staff to have them report back for two minutes on the status of the Preservation Element work that has been going on.
 
 I think the target for a draft is March or April.


I'd also like to have some information on bus rapid transit along Van Ness.
 
 Although it's transportation related, there have been some comments made on impacts to adjacent businesses.
 
 I'd like a briefing sometime in our free schedule.


I brought this up last time, but I think I'll make a formal request of the City Attorney's Office to get an opinion on whether or not we need to have public comment on items that have closed public hearings.
 
 We have the category on our calendars that allows public comment on items that have already had a public hearing and the public hearing is closed.
 
 That seems to me a contradiction.
 
 If we are closing public hearing then I don't understand why we have to open it again for comments from the public.
 
 So I'd like an opinion on that from the City Attorney's Office




Commissioner Olague




I keep hearing from members of the public about all these plans around increasing heights in certain areas of the city.


I think it would be good for commissioners to be briefed about where those heights are being proposed.


In addition to the Transbay and other areas, I think in general there is some talk of it.


I'm not really aware of what that looks like.
 
 So I'd like to have something of where and to what extent.
 


Also, I mentioned this once before and I guess I can work with Linda on this, but during the Yon Gail] presentation, Alan Jacobs spoke and he made some comments about urban design and heights in San Francisco.
 
 And I guess he was part of the team that drafted the Urban Design Element for the city.
 
 I know there have been changes since then but I would like to get a better understanding of what the original intentions were and a little more background information and analysis of where we were originally and how we have evolved from there.
 
 At some point I'd like to here some perspective on it, maybe from Alan Jacobs and others.
 
 And heights in terms of the urban design perspective – that's want I want to look at too.


In the Examiner about a week ago there was an article about absences.
 
 I know that one of our commissioners made the list of people who had some extensive absences last year, but I do want the public to know that it was due to his mother having a grave illness and then his mother passed away.
 
 A lot of absences had to do with the fact that his mother was dying.
 
 I think it's important for members of the public to know that because sometimes when we read an article without any explanation it is easy to interpret that as being a sign of being dismissive or irresponsible to this position.
 
 I just wanted members of the public to know that in the case of Mr. Alexander it had to do with his mother passing.
 
 It was a long process that was off and on for about a year.

 DIRECTOR'S REPORT


 


8.
 
 Director's Announcements


 


Director Macris




First, responding to some comments made by commissioners:


On the Transbay Terminal project -- There is an area around the terminal we reviewed about six months ago at the request of the Mayor and the Joint Powers Authority for potential increase in height principally to create more value that might enable more income to build the terminal.


We had been granted $500,000 to take a more detailed examination of what restructuring of regulations we could propose to allow that to happen and that addressed important aesthetic considerations as far as shadowing affects, congestion affects and so forth.


We are pursuing that project.


There is currently an RFP that we have issued in which a number of firms have indicated an interest in assisting the department in undertaking that project.


The schedule of that project is to have a pretty good notion in the latter part of this year on what could be recommended along those lines.


I know this is of vital interest to the Commission and to the public in general because we've had a lot of comment about height increases in that area.


My suggestion would be that we afford the Commission a review of how we are proceeding with this project during the course of this year.


We'll set a schedule that doesn't over do it but keeps you fully informed on the process that we are engaged in and where we think we are headed with that.


In the meantime you should know that there have been proposals made in this area that exceeds the current limits.
 
 Now those are proposals and they are going to be examined.
 
 What you've heard about heights, are exactly that. They are what the developer is proposing to be done.


Our obligation, because there is a competition underway sponsored by the Joint Powers Authority to design and build a terminal and tower associated with it, is to keep that project informed as it moves along in design.


There has been a lot of international interest in this project.


All of that, as far as the staff is concerned, is in the Commission's prerogative.


The [project] is part of a Redevelopment Area here.


We have a delegation agreement with the Redevelopment Agency.


In the end, this Commission will be making its decisions about changes in zoning regulations that enables buildings to be built in this area.

Request for Determination of Compliance and Rear Yard Exception
 under Section 309 of the Planning Code. The project would convert the existing four-story commercial building, a Category I structure constructed in 1906, with a total area of approximately 57,000 gross square feet, from office and retail uses to residential and retail uses. The conversion would retain approximately 2,000 square feet of retail use along the Ecker Street frontage and would add approximately 51 residential dwelling units from the ground through the fourth floor levels. The existing building currently contains no existing off-street parking spaces and no off-street parking spaces are proposed as part of the project. As the existing structure fully covers the lot, an exception to the rear yard requirements is requested at all residential floor levels. T
he property is currently within a C-3-O (Downtown, Office) District and a 550-S Height and Bulk District.

Plan Area


The Plan encompasses an irregularly shaped area in northeast San Francisco. It extends two to three blocks in width along Market Street for ten blocks and extends north along the former Central Freeway alignment at Octavia Boulevard for ten blocks. Along Market Street, the Plan Area boundaries extend from 11th and Larkin Streets in the east to Noe and Scott Streets in the west.
 
 The boundary jogs north along Noe Street, Duboce Avenue, Scott Street, Waller Street, Webster Street, Oak Street, Buchanan Street, and Grove Street; continues north along the former Central Freeway alignment to include the area up toTurk Street between Laguna and Franklin Streets; and east of Franklin Street jogs south to Grove and Larkin Streets. The Project Area boundary extends south of Market Street between 10th and 11th Street to Howard Street. Extending west along Howard Street, the Project Area boundaries jog along Division, Clinton, Stevenson, Fourteenth, Guerrero, and Sixteenth Streets. The Project Area is comprised of 89 Assessor's Blocks in entirety or in part, including the whole of Blocks 759, 761, 768, 770, 783, 785, 792 to 794, 806 to 809, 813 to 819, 830 to 841, 850 to 858, 863 to 876, 3501 to 3506, 3512 to 3514, 3533 to 3538, 3541 to 3545, 3556 to 3560; and
 
 portions of 3507 (lot 40), 3510 (lots 49, 57), 3511 (lots 1, 23, 25, 31, 33, 74, 75, 80, 82, and 93), and 3532 (lots 14, 19B, 35, 36, 88, 89, 90 and 91).


 


Specifically, the Commission will consider the following items and may take action on or after January 18, 2007:
 


 


Â·
 
 
Case 2003.0347M -
 a proposed 
General Plan amendment
 that would add a new area plan, the Market and Octavia Area Plan, and make related amendments to the Commerce and Industry, Housing, Recreation and Open Space and Transportation Elements, the Civic Center Area Plan, Downtown Area Plan, South of Market Area Plan and the Land Use Index;
 


 


Â·
 
 
Case 2003.0347T -
 a proposed 
Planning Code text amendment
 that would revise Planning Code controls, including controls for land use, height and bulk, building design, loading, parking and establish new fees;


 


Â·
 
 
Case 2003.0347Z -
 a proposed 
Zoning Map amendment
 that would revise Maps 2 and 2H, 7 and 7H, and 2SU and 7SU.
 
 The proposed Planning Code text and map (Zoning Map) amendments would a) establish three new zoning districts, b) amend the Hayes-Gough, Upper Market, and Valencia Neighborhood Commercial Districts (NCDs), c) update height and bulk districts, d) establish the Market and Octavia Community Improvements Impact Fee, and e) make related revisions necessary to implement the General Plan.
 
 The proposed changes are described in greater detail in Case 2003.0347T (above).
 


 


Together, these Commission actions are intended to implement the Market and Octavia Plan.
 
 In addition, an historic survey is currently being done of the project area; property owners considering constructing
 
 or altering a building in this area should consult with Planning Department staff to determine
 
 the historic resource status of their property.
 
 Property owners and interested parties are advised that height limits and other controls do not provide unqualified rights to development, but rather, proscribe the maximum potential building envelope that may be permitted; proposed buildings may not reach the maximum permitted building height/envelope.
 
 
 
 The Commission may also consider establishing interim procedures to guide the review of plans to construct new structures and alter existing structures to
 
 protect
 
 potentially eligible historic resources in the Plan Area prior to conclusion of an historic resources survey.
 


 


Members of the public may review a copy of the proposed amendments at the San Francisco Planning Department office at 1660 Mission Street 5th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94103, at the Public Library (the Main Library 100 Larkin St., and Harvey Milk branch library, 1 Jose Sarria Ct. (near16th & Market Sts.).
 
 An electronic copy of the proposed amendments and actions is available at
 
http://marketoctavia.betterneighborhoods.org
.
 


 


As part of 
Case No. 2003.0347T
, the proposed Planning Code text amendment would revise Planning Code controls, including controls for land use, height and bulk, building design, loading, parking and establish new fees.
 
 The proposed amendments are described more fully below:


 


 
 
Establishment of Three Zoning Districts in the Plan Area


The 
Transit-Oriented Residential Use District
(RTO)
 
will replace most of the RH and RM districts zoning north and south of the Market Street corridor, extending north to Turk Street, west to Noe and Scott Streets, and South to Sixteenth Street. The proposed RTO district will encourage moderate-density, multi-family, and residential infill. Because of the availability of transit service, proximity of retail and services within walking distance, and limitation on permitted parking the RTO permits the construction of some housing without accessory parking. Parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing within buildings in keeping with neighborhood scale. Proposed heights in 
Residential Transit Oriented (RTO)
 Districts and RH districts primarily remain 40 and 50 feet as currently classified; in some 
RTO
 areas, permitted heights will change from 50, 80 and 105 feet to 40 and 50 feet.


 


A 
Neighborhood Commercial Transit District (NCT)
 will
 overlay the Hayes-Gough Neighborhood Commercial District and portions of the Upper Market and Valencia Neighborhood Commercial Districts within the Market and Octavia neighborhood.
 
 In 
named NCT and NC-1 (T) districts
, parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing above ground-floor retail uses. These districts will largely keep the existing specific use-size controls. They include current Neighborhood Commercial Districts (Hayes-Gough, portions of the Upper Market, Valencia) and several parcels currently zoned NC-1.
 


 


The 
Van Ness and Market Downtown Residential Special Use District (VNMDR-SUD)
 will permit the development of a transit-oriented, high-density, mixed-use neighborhood around the intersections of Van Ness Avenue and Market Street and South Van Ness Avenue and Mission Street.
 
 This SUD will overlay existing C-3-G districts and existing C-M districts will be rezoned to C-3-G with this new VNMDR-SUD. Parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing in buildings with mixed-used podiums and some residential towers at two key intersections: Market Street and Van Ness Avenue and Mission Street and South Van Ness Avenue. Proposed heights in the 
Van Ness and Market Downtown Residential Use District (VNMDR-SUD)
 will change from 120, 130, 150, 160, 200 and 320 feet to 85, 120, 200, 320 and 400 feet; towers will be permitted over a podium of 85 or 120 feet; the highest towers will be permitted in the vicinity of the Market Street/Van Ness Avenue intersections.
 


 


In the 
Transit-Oriented Neighborhood Commercial Use Districts (NCT
),
 height districts will change from 50, 80 and 105 feet to primarily 55, 65 and 85 feet; these districts will be located in SoMa West and along Market Street. The NCT district will largely replace C-M and NC-3 districts. In the 
NCT district
, parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing above ground-floor retail uses. These districts will largely keep the existing specific use-size controls in place in the NC-3 district. Some heights on some parcels near Brady Street will change from 105 and 60 feet to 40 feet and 85 feet on parcels surrounding a proposed public open space.


 


 
 Establishment of New Fees in the Plan Area


In order to fund the community improvements identified in the Plan, the Program document proposes to establish a 
Development Impact Fee
, requiring the growth that generates the demand for additional infrastructure and services to provide some of the revenue required to fund the improvements.
 
 The proposal establishes a development impact fee on new residential and commercial development in the Plan Area.
 
 The fee proposal is $10.00 per square foot of residential development, and $4.00 per square foot of commercial development.
 


 


To encourage the provision of necessary and desirable public infrastructure improvements and also in order to mitigate the impacts of this increased localized density, the Department has established the 
Van Ness and Market Neighborhood Infrastructure Fund
. Developers may provide in-kind public improvements (such as open space or streetscape improvements) or proportional in-lieu contributions to this fund that will allow the city to develop these facilities. The Department estimates that no more than 6 potential development sites would benefit from participating in the program. The Department has set the value of the additional FAR at par with the current market value of historic TDR credits ($15 per square foot).


 
 Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Adopt the following:


 




Draft Motion to Certify the EIR and adopt CEQA Findings (Case 2003.0347EE)


Draft Resolution to amend the General Plan (Case 2003.0347M)




Draft Resolution to amend the Planning Code (Case 2003.0347T)

PUBLIC COMMENT


 


At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.
 
 With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.
 
 When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.
 
 Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.


 


The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.
 
 In response to public comment, the commission is limited to:


 


(1)
 
 responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or


(2)
 
 requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or




directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.
