 Merchants have voted to make Chestnut Street Shopping District a special use with very unusual limitations.




We started a historical art deco district because it has the largest collection of it.


We are having a problem with block book notifications.

 A historical tower has been torn down and it had the block book note.
 
 It was approved without going through us.




We want to work at keeping a variety of businesses on Chestnut Street for neighborhood service.

Preliminary Recommendation:
 
Take discretionary review and approve the project with modifications.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of February 1, 2007)


 


SPEAKERS


Steve Williams, Requestor's Representative


-
 
 Project does not fit the neighborhood character.


-
 
 We met with staff and the Project Sponsor and thought we had an agreement.


-
 
 Project reductions are at very minimum.


-
 
 It is in the middle of the block and incompatible.


-
 
 Addition would be a 60-percent increase over what exists.


Steven Condiotti


-
 
 Concern that it would set precedence for high buildings.


-
 
 We are very concerned with preserving our neighborhood character.


-
 
 Many people supporting the project sponsors do not live in the neighborhood - neither on the same block.


Marie and Dan Goodell


-
 
 We support changes in the neighborhood if they comply with codes and keep the character of the neighborhood.


-
 
 This project, the way it is today, is not compatible.


Andre Srinivasan


-
 
 We need to work together to maintain the character of the neighborhood.


-
 
 Asked the Commission to follow staff's recommendation to remove the third floor.


Deana Mooney, Director of Neighborhood Association


-
 
 The Association supports the Discretionary Review.


Suzy LaMarca and Jonathan Walkers


-
 
 We live in a house that had a third floor addition when we bought it.


-
 
 It is out of character and this pattern should not be followed.


Heather Beal


-
 
 Concerned about light and air, massing and precedence that would negatively impact our neighborhood.


-
 
 Follow staff's recommendation.


Violet Bohme


-
 
 We have enjoyed our home with no addition to the house needed.


-
 
 Neighborhood has been a great value to us.


Theodora Mauro


-
 
 Concerned that the project sponsor has not been truthful. There was a verbal agreement, but the plans that were submitted are different.




Requested that the Commission follow up after construction to ensure compliance with the approval.




 


 


Diane McCarney and Pauline


-
 
 After numerous meeting with project sponsor, neighbors hire an architect to submit design alternatives.


-
 
 The property has substantial lot depth.


-
 
 Project Sponsor committed to less than a one percent reduction in a mediation process that has gone on for half a year.


-
 
 We highly value our neighborhood character.


-
 
 At the meeting with the Zoning Administrator, it was clear that instructions were to remove the third floor addition.


Steve


-
 
 Consider neighborhood character when making your decision.


Phyllis Lyon


-
 
 There is a change in the ambiance of the neighborhood.


-
 
 Do not allow any more extensions.


Christian Meyers


-
 
 The proposed project would damage the character of the neighborhood.


-
 
 Most houses are two levels.


Betty Peskin, Diamond Heights Neighborhood Association


-
 
 Proposed project would affect many people because of the nature of the streets being narrow and in a tight turn.


Leon, Diamond Heights Neighborhood Association


-
 
 It is important to keep the character of the neighborhood.


-
 
 This project could be a magnet for trophy type homes.


Mike Miller


-
 
 The proposed project would have a great impact on the neighborhood making it out of proportion.


Kristin Hansen, Project Sponsor


-
 
 We have tried to combine the challenges of our need for extra space with not adversely impacting our neighbors.


-
 
 Our home currently has two bedrooms, one bath and no dining area.


-
 
 The design for the third floor addition was done taking into consideration similar additions done to one third of the houses on the block.


-
 
 The proposed project would help us accommodate extra space for home-office and extra rooms for a growing family.


Chad Hamilton, Architect


-
 
 Three out of nine houses on the block have third floor additions larger than the project proposed.


-
 
 My clients agreed to make changes suggested by staff.


-
 
 This project does not affect neighborhood character.


Brett Gladstone


-
 
 It is important to mention that my clients started the process of an addition by contacting the Department and the neighborhood.


-
 
 Staff previously recommended approval of this project.


-
 
 It does not impact privacy, sunlight or air.


-
 
 This project could set a good precedence.


-
 
 Three changes requested by the Zoning Administrator during mediation were done.


Reverend Boyd


-
 
 Supports the project.
 
 It would enhance the neighborhood.

 We started with a modest proposal and have modified it many times based on feedback from neighbors and the department.


Ron Miguel


-
 
 This is a viable solution to housing issues in the city.


-
 
 People finding an affordable home with the chance of an addition.


-
 
 The addition is architecturally acceptable, conforming to the Residential Design Guideline standards and codes.


Hene Kelly


-
 
 The project is going to keep the character of the neighborhood.


-
 
 It is a wise decision to buy single dwelling unit and convert legally to a family home.


Susan Kramer


-
 
 I see my friends and relatives that are moving out of the city because of housing.


-
 
 Buying something affordable and improving it within the law and the codes allows families to live in the city.


Aileen Hernandez


-
 
 We are loosing children in the city and housing is a big issue.


-
 
 It is very creative to buy an affordable house and add space to it in order to stay.


Spencer Yao


-
 
 Family changes all the time.


-
 
 My concern is that this would set a precedence to limit additions to accommodate families.


Rebecca Eisenberg


-
 
 My big concern is that there are no children in the neighborhood to be friends with my own children.

 of Building Permit Application No. 2006.07.03.5586 proposing to remove an existing sun porch at the rear of the building and to construct a two-story rear addition with basement measuring approximately 19 feet deep by 12 feet wide.

SPEAKERS


John Briscue, Discretionary Review Representative


-
 
 Requested mediation five times with no response from Project Sponsor.


-
 
 Project intrudes into the middle space and impacts a landmark.


-
 
 We have three alternative plans to minimize the negative impact on a historic building.


John Clark, Architect for the Discretionary Review Requestor


-
 
 This project does not comply with mid-block guidelines.


-
 
 The proposed rear yard addition impacts light, air and open space.


-
 
 It would increase shadows in the middle of the day when historic landmarks are most likely to be experienced by the public.


-
 
 Concern about excavation damaging or impacting the building.


Lois Bea


-
 
 Consider the alternative designs to preserve the integrity of the house.


Tom Robertson


-
 
 Lived across the street and it is an extraordinary view to see the mansion.


-
 
 We all know the importance of historic structures in San Francisco and the mansion would be cast in shadows.


Katherine


-
 
 Historic structures are architecture gems and so important in the city.


Ed Bea


-
 
 Read a letter of support from a neighbor who was not able to attend because of illness.


Patricia Vaughey


-
 
 Historical structure does not just apply to the house but to the entire property.


-
 
 Project Sponsor refused to participate in the Community Board's for mediation and to have soil and structure analysis done.


-
 
 There was no sign of compromise from the project sponsor.


Christopher Hays


-
 
 This landmark is historical building number 51 in San Francisco.


-
 
 It was deemed by the Landmark Board more important that many popular historical places in the city.


-
 
 The proposed project would compromise the structure and open space.


Cynthia


-
 
 This is a very important value to the City.
 
 It should be preserved above all.


Cornelia Griffin, Project Architect


-
 
 According to the City Planning's historic preservation review, the project does not impact the setting.


-
 
 Alternative designs were made without consulting my clients and it does not meet their needs.


-
 
 The project hearing was continued by the Commission because of a concern for the front faÃ§ade and not the rear addition.


-
 
 Shadows already exist from the structure of the mansion and plants on the front yard.


-
 
 The addition is within the allowable space.


-
 
 Denying the project would be depriving what is legally right.


Beverly Cannon, Owner


-
 
 The roof and garage were altered considerably by previous owners.


-
 
 Addition could have been design to increase it twice.


-
 
 We need to repair the stairs.


David Parry


-
 
 This addition is very small.


-
 
 It would not negatively impact adjacent properties.


Monte Stott, Engineer


-
 
 The proposed addition was designed to not impact adjacent property.


-
 
 Retaining wall would be designed with drainage to minimize water damages.


-
 
 Neighborhood retaining wall is 12 inches high away from proposed project and it would not be negatively impacted.


Kenneth Wachtel, Project Sponsor Representative


-
 
 Original report by staff was to not grant discretionary review.


-
 
 The last report says that discretionary review should be granted only to do a demarcation to separate the new structure from the old one.
 
 We agreed.


-
 
 This project is in full compliance within the codes.


-
 
 Historic preservation codes do not protect beyond the property line.

255 Seventh Street, Westbrook Plaza
 
- 
Public Hearing on The Draft Environmental Impact Report (
Eir
)
. The project site is located at 255 Seventh Street (Assessor's Block 3731, Lots 126 and 154) mid-block between Howard and Folsom Streets in the South of Market neighborhood.
 
 The approximately 23,655-square-foot, T-shaped project site fronts the east side of Seventh Street and the west side of Moss Street.
 
 The existing site includes a one-story commercial building totaling about 2,000 square feet and a one-story building totaling about 960 square feet.
 
 The rest of the lot is occupied by a surface parking lot.
 
 The proposed project would demolish both structures and eliminate the surface parking lot.
 
 The proposed project would result in the construction of two new buildings and a subsurface parking lot with 45 off-street parking spaces.
 
 A five-story, 50-foot building with three levels of residential above a two-level health center would front Seventh Street.
 
 A four-story, 40-foot residential building would front Moss Street.
 
 The Seventh Street Building would contain an approximately 20,000-square-foot out-patient South of Market Health Center (SMHC) and 30 affordable dwelling units.
 
 The Moss Street Building would have 19 affordable dwelling units.
 
 The project site is within the SLR (Service/Light Industrial Mixed Use) and RED (Residential Enclave) zoning districts and the 50-X/40-X height and bulk districts.
 
 The project site is in the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan Area and is subject to the Housing/Mixed Use Guidelines.

SPEAKERS


David Sullivan, Project Sponsor Representative


-
 
 This project would improve neighborhood safety.


-
 
 Family units and retail would increase lighting and foot traffic.


-
 
 It is within walking distance to public transportation.


-
 
 The central courtyard would provide open space for residents and adjacent neighbors.


-
 
 We have full support of two adjacent owners.


Richard Bensman


-

-
 
 I am concerned about possible damages to the adjacent structures.


Ed Bedard


-

-
 
 It is over parked and retail space should have a 12-foot height minimum.


-
 
 Linden Street is not a living street.
 
 It is an alley.


-
 
 Put the mechanical area in the garage and use ground floor for livable space.


Jerry Moskowit

PACIFIC AVENUE PROPOSED REZONING
-
 
The proposed Ordinance would amend Planning Code and Zoning Maps for the City and County of San Francisco to create a new Neighborhood Commercial District on Pacific Avenue east of Polk Street to the east side of the intersection of Pacific Avenue and Jones Street.
 
 The remainder of the parcels east of Jones to Taylor Street would be rezoned to RM-1 (Small Scale Mixed Use Residential).
 
 This proposed rezoning would also eliminate the existing Planning Code Section 236 provisions for a Garment Manufacturing Special Use District in the neighborhood.
 
 The proposed Ordinance has been crafted to permit the continued use of the commercial portions of Pacific Avenue in a neighborhood commercial zoning district that has been tailored to meet the small scale operational needs and sentiments of local residential property owners and businesses.
 
 The tailored controls for the Pacific Avenue NCD preserve the scale and existing character of the neighborhood by reducing allowable height limits, increased rear yard requirements and limiting appropriate commercial uses on the street.
 
 The garment manufacturing Special Use District no longer has commercial viability or locational needs in this neighborhood.


Preliminary Recommendation: Approval and forward to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors for consideration.


 


SPEAKERS

-
 
 Rezoning is needed.
 
 It would bring zoning into protecting neighborhood character.

-
 
 We have a project in process that would be affected by this ordinance.


-
 
 We have met with city officials, the department, and neighbors.


-
 
 Urged to have this rezoning applicable for projects filed after October 1, 2005.


Benjamin, 1355 Pacific Avenue


-
 
 This project would be a buffer between new height limits and existing tall structures.


-
 
 We are willing to work with the department and neighbors for an intermediate height limit.


Erick Tang


-
 
 This ordinance would affect families trying to accommodate themselves and stay within the neighborhood.


Harold Tang

-
 
 I want to express my appreciation the Commission and Executive Director for their commitment.

 The public process has been served with hearings and a multitude of meetings in neighborhoods.


-
 
 This process of seven years should have a conclusion.


-
 
 It has been a long process taking into consideration the diverse community with its points of view.


-
 
 The conclusion considered tonight offers an on going process from implementation of fees, transit, and density to protect the character of the city.


-
 
 The city needs housing and perhaps we should consider super inclusionary housing.


-
 
 Some people would like more historical preservation studies.


-
 
 We have made a lot of progress and you have addressed the concern of historical preservation.


-
 
 Again, thank you for the commitment to these issues and I hope you give some dignity to the work done for the past seven years.


Lavon Taback, Resident of Hayes Valley Neighborhood

Certification of Final Environmental Impact Report -
 The project area lies to the west of the City's downtown financial district and sits at the junction of several neighborhoods, including, Civic Center, Hayes Valley, Western Addition, South of Market, Inner Mission, the Castro, Duboce Triangle, Eureka Valley, and Upper Market.
 
 The proposed neighborhood plan would reclassify the existing zoning from Residential Districts (R), Neighborhood Commercial Districts (NCD's), Moderate-Scale Neighborhood Commercial (NC-3), and Heavy Commercial (C-M) to Downtown General Commercial Districts (C-3-G), Residential Transit Oriented (RTO), Neighborhood Commercial Transit Districts (NCT), Neighborhood Commercial-Transit, and Moderate-Scale Mixed Use Districts (NCT-3). It would also increase height limits in certain areas and reduce height limits in other areas.
 
 The proposed zoning and height reclassifications would increase the potential for residential development in the area.


Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the Final Environmental Impact Report.
 


Please note: The public review period for the Draft Environmental Impact Report is closed.
 
 The Planning Commission does not conduct public review of Final EIRs. Public comments on the certification may be presented to the Planning Commission during the Public Comment portion of the Commission calendar

Market & Octavia Neighborhood Plan
 
 
-
 
Adoption of CEQA Findings Related to EIR and Potential Project Approval Action
 
- The project includes proposed amendments to the General Plan, Planning Code and Zoning Map.
 
 The project area lies to the west of the City's downtown financial district and sits at the junction of several neighborhoods, including, Civic Center, Hayes Valley, Western Addition, South of Market, Inner Mission, the Castro, Duboce Triangle, Eureka Valley, and Upper Market.
 
 The proposed neighborhood plan would:
 
 
(1) amend the General Plan, adding a new Area Plan (the Market and Octavia Area Plan) and make related amendments to the Commerce and Industry, Housing, Recreation and Open Space and Transportation Elements, the Civic Center Area Plan, Downtown Area Plan, South of Market Area Plan and the Land Use Index; and (2)
 
amend the Planning Code and Zoning Map to reclassify the existing zoning from Residential Districts (R), Neighborhood Commercial Districts (NCD's), Moderate-Scale Neighborhood Commercial (NC-3), and Heavy Commercial (C-M) to Downtown General Commercial Districts (C-3-G), Residential Transit Oriented (RTO), Neighborhood Commercial Transit Districts (NCT), Neighborhood Commercial-Transit, Moderate-Scale Mixed Use Districts (NCT-3). The project would also increase height limits in certain areas and reduce height limits in other areas, and establish new fees.
 
 The proposed zoning and height reclassifications would increase the potential for residential development in the area.

 Urged to approve the plan and support the concept of super inclusionary housing on Van Ness Avenue.


Tom Radulovich, Livable City


-
 
 We support the density in this plan.


-
 
 Parking controls from original draft were much better than the current ones.


Jim Warshell, Hayes Valley Neighborhood Association


-
 
 Include language for historic preservation survey.
 
 On future plans, work on this matter earlier.


-
 
 Supports the plan and urged its approval.


Peter Cohen, Duboce Triangle Association


-
 
 The plan is much better now.
 
 Public transportation is still a concern.


-
 
 We submitted recommendations to fund a better bus implementation program


Adam Millard


-
 
 Urged not to separate the plan.
 
 Approve for better developments and growth of the city.


Robin Levitt


-
 
 Parking is a big concern.


-
 
 New residents bringing cars would increase vehicle traffic.


-
 
 Draft proposal from 2002 was much better.


Demian Quesnel


-
 
 Market and Octavia is not a neighborhood.


-
 
 This plan includes 4 existing neighborhoods.


-
 
 Neighborhoods are not treated equally.


Anita Margrill


-
 
 Affordable housing should be available for people that really need it like community servers (policeman, teachers and fireman).


David Silverman, 555 Fulton Street Project


-
 
 Set a 50-foot height limit for the project at 555 Fulton Street.


Drake Gardner


-
 
 The project on 555 Fulton Street has become very important to the community.


-
 
 It would bring reasonable costs, accessible usage, and employment opportunities.


Cynthia Servetnick, Save 55 Laguna Street Campus


-
 
 The University of California Berkeley extension has been a designated landmark and a national register nominee.


-
 
 Include mitigation measures in the Market-Octavia plan: (a) citizen advisory commission and (b) comprehensive analysis.


-
 
 The same historic preservation the University in Berkeley is suggesting should be implemented in San Francisco.


Hiroshi Fukuda


-
 
 This plan discriminates against the poor, senior, and disabled people.


-
 
 It offers high cost housing and density populations.


Jim Keith


-Set back the height limit to 55 feet on Parcel I on Gough Street.


Tes


-
 
 This plan provides density and merger controls as well as housing for families.


-
 
 Urged approval of it.


Karen


-
 
 This is a good plan including hearings, meetings with neighborhoods and associations.


-
 
 Move it forward and bring the growth the city is expecting.


Sue Hestor


-
 
 Do a finding for not having done studies on climate for wind and shadows on public spaces.


-
 
 You should eliminate the 400-foot height limit on Market and Van Ness Avenue and start at 120 feet -- maybe increasing it going up Market Street.


-
 
 The City would be providing housing mainly for Silicon Valley and not San Franciscans.


-
 
 Drivers would have three accesses to the freeway and it would create congestion.


Christopher Peterson


-
 
 I'd rather support the 2002 original draft plan.


-
 
 Process has been reasonable and it would be better than this one.


-
 
 Avoid temptations for allowing additional parking and to maximize housing for people [not] living and serving the city.


Frank Wise


-
 
 Consider allowing more parking on Dolores and Noe Streets.


Mark Paez


-
 
 Include preliminary findings from the survey.


-
 
 We would like to see more independent review data and not just the Department Staff's.


-
 
 Consider a viable approach to approve the plan neighborhood by neighborhood.


Marc Solomon


-
 
 Western South of Market is concerned that this process has taken seven years and there are still some issues pending.


-
 
 The plan has no historical preservation survey, affordability or transportation.


-
 
 Some areas were privileged to benefit their neighborhood while other areas did not.


Tamara Cobby, Save UC Berkeley Extension Campus


-
 
 Make it clear that a 400-foot height limit on Market and Van Ness Avenue is to help affordable housing.


-
 
 55 Laguna College Campus represents the heart and culture of the city.
 
 It needs preservation.


Marilyn Amini


-
 
 Process for this plan has been deficient.


-
 
 It will impact transit and policies of the entire city.


-
 
 Neighborhoods are not treated equally.

Extending west along Howard Street, the Project Area boundaries jog along Division, Clinton, Stevenson, Fourteenth, Guerrero, and Sixteenth Streets. The Project Area is comprised of 89 Assessor's Blocks in entirety or in part, including the whole of Blocks 759, 761, 768, 770, 783, 785, 792 to 794, 806 to 809, 813 to 819, 830 to 841, 850 to 858, 863 to 876, 3501 to 3506, 3512 to 3514, 3533 to 3538, 3541 to 3545, 3556 to 3560; and portions of 3507 (lot 40), 3510 (lots 49, 57), 3511 (lots 1, 23, 25, 31, 33, 74, 75, 80, 82, and 93), and 3532 (lots 14, 19B, 35, 36, 88, 89, 90 and 91).


Hearing # 9 – April 5, 2007 - Schedule for Planning Commission Consideration




Respond to Commissioner comments and questions.


Consider taking action to approve resolutions adopting amendments to the General Plan, Planning Code, Zoning Map and approving interim procedures within the project area (items a, b, c, d)




The Planning Commission has held a number of public hearings to consider Case No. 2003.0347MTZU.
 
 Hearings were held on October 26, 2006, Nov. 2, 2006, Nov. 9, 2006, Nov. 16, 2006, January 11, 2007, Feb. 8, 2007, and Feb. 15, 2007, and March 22, 2007.
 
 At the hearings, the Planning Commission considered various aspects of the Project, and on March 22, 2007, passed a Motion of intent to adopt General Plan, Planning Code and Zoning Map amendments and adopt interim procedures for review of projects within the plan area to realize the vision articulated by the community through the Market and Octavia community planning process.
 
 For more information on this six-year planning process, please visit our website at ttp://marketoctavia.betterneighborhoods.org. The Commission has considered staff presentations and public comment on specific aspects of the Plan and proposed amendments at each hearing.
 
 The Planning Commission will consider the following items and may take action on or after April 5, 2007.
 
 Be advised that due to the nature of the public hearings, the Commission may continue any particular hearing item and/or may not hear all items at the hearing.
 
 To confirm the final Commission Hearing schedule, on the week of the hearing please visit:
 
 
http://www.sfgov.org/site/planning_meeting.asp?id=15840
 
 or call Aksel Olsen at 558-6616.
 
 For more information on this six-year planning process, please visit our website at
 
http://marketoctavia.betterneighborhoods.org
.
 
 In addition to providing information about the proposed General Plan, Planning Code and Zoning Map amendments, staff will also provide follow-up information on issues discussed at earlier hearings.
 


Together, the Commission actions are intended to implement the Market and Octavia Plan.
 
 In addition, an historic survey is currently being done of the project area; property owners considering constructing
 
 or altering a building in this area should consult with Planning Department staff to determine
 
 the historic resource status of their property.
 
 Property owners and interested parties are advised that height limits and other controls do not provide unqualified rights to development, but rather, proscribe the maximum potential building envelope that may be permitted; proposed buildings may not reach the maximum permitted building height/envelope.
 
 The Commission may also consider establishing interim procedures to guide the review of plans to construct new structures and alter existing structures to
 
 protect
 
 potentially eligible historic resources in the Plan Area prior to conclusion of an historic resources survey.
 


Members of the public may review a copy of the proposed amendments at the San Francisco Planning Department office at 1660 Mission Street 5th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94103, at the Public Library (the Main Library 100 Larkin St., and Harvey Milk branch library, 1 Jose Sarria Ct. (near 16th & Market Sts.).
 
 An electronic copy of the proposed amendments and actions is available at 
http://marketoctavia.betterneighborhoods.org
. At this hearing, the Planning Commission will consider the following aspects of the Plan:


 


Informational Only.
 
 No Action required of the Commission.

MARKET AND OCTAVIA PLAN AMENDMENTS
 
 - 
Adoption of amendments to the Planning Code
 for the area described in item 19a above.
 
 The proposed Planning Code amendment would revise Planning Code controls, including controls for land use, height and bulk, building design, loading, parking and establish new fees.
 
 
On Sept. 28, 2006, the Planning Commission adopted Res. 17313, a
 
Resolution of Intention to initiate amendments to the Planning Code.
 


 


In order to fund the community improvements identified in the Plan, the Program document proposes to establish a Development Impact Fee, requiring the growth that generates the demand for additional infrastructure and services to provide some of the revenue required to fund the improvements.
 
 The proposal establishes a development impact fee on new residential and commercial development in the Plan Area.
 
 The fee proposal is $10.00 per square foot of residential development, and $4.00 per square foot of commercial development.


To encourage the provision of necessary and desirable public infrastructure improvements and also in order to mitigate the impacts of this increased localized density, the Department has established the Van Ness and Market Neighborhood Infrastructure Fund. Developers may provide in-kind public improvements (such as open space or streetscape improvements) or proportional in-lieu contributions to this fund that will allow the city to develop these facilities. The Department estimates that no more than 6 potential development sites would benefit from participating in the program. The Department has set the value of the additional FAR at par with the current market value of historic TDR credits ($15 per square foot).


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Adopt a Draft Resolution amending the Planning Code.


NOTE: On March 22, 2007, following public testimony, the Commission closed public hearing and passed a motion of intent to adopt/approve by a vote of +4 –1.

MARKET AND OCTAVIA PLAN AMENDMENTS
 -
 
Adoption of amendments to the Zoning Map
 
for the area described in item
 
19a 
above. The proposed Zoning Map amendment would revise Maps 2 and 2H, 7 and 7H, and 2SU and 7SU.
 
 The proposed Planning Code text and map (Zoning Map) amendments would a) establish three new zoning districts, b) amend the Hayes-Gough, Upper Market, and Valencia Neighborhood Commercial Districts (NCDs), c) update height and bulk districts, d) establish the Market and Octavia Community Improvements Impact Fee, and e) make related revisions necessary to implement the General Plan.
 
 The proposed changes are described in greater detail in Case 2003.0347T (above). As part of Case No. 2003.0347T, the proposed Planning Code text amendment would revise Planning Code controls, including controls for land use, height and bulk, building design, loading, parking and establish new fees.
 
 On Sept. 26, 2006, the Planning Commission adopted Res. No. 17314, a Resolution of Intention to initiate amendments to the Zoning Map.
 
 The proposed amendments are described more fully below: 
Establishment of Three Zoning Districts in the Plan Area


The Transit-Oriented Residential Use District (RTO) will replace most of the RH and RM districts zoning north and south of the Market Street corridor, extending north to Turk Street, west to Noe and Scott Streets, and South to Sixteenth Street. The proposed RTO district will encourage moderate-density, multi-family, and residential infill. Because of the availability of transit service, proximity of retail and services within walking distance, and limitation on permitted parking the RTO permits the construction of some housing without accessory parking. Parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing within buildings in keeping with neighborhood scale. Proposed heights in Residential Transit Oriented (RTO) Districts and RH districts primarily remain 40 and 50 feet as currently classified; in some RTO areas, permitted heights will change from 50, 80 and 105 feet to 40 and 50 feet.


A Neighborhood Commercial Transit District (NCT) will overlay the Hayes-Gough Neighborhood Commercial District and portions of the Upper Market and Valencia Neighborhood Commercial Districts within the Market and Octavia neighborhood.
 
 In named NCT and NC-1 (T) districts, parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing above ground-floor retail uses. These districts will largely keep the existing specific use-size controls. They include current Neighborhood Commercial Districts (Hayes-Gough, portions of the Upper Market, Valencia) and several parcels currently zoned NC-1.


The Van Ness and Market Downtown Residential Special Use District (VNMDR-SUD) will permit the development of a transit-oriented, high-density, mixed-use neighborhood around the intersections of Van Ness Avenue and Market Street and South Van Ness Avenue and Mission Street.
 
 This SUD will overlay existing C-3-G districts and existing C-M districts will be rezoned to C-3-G with this new VNMDR-SUD. Parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing in buildings with mixed-used podiums and some residential towers at two key intersections: Market Street and Van Ness Avenue and Mission Street and South Van Ness Avenue. Proposed heights in the Van Ness and Market Downtown Residential Use District (VNMDR-SUD) will change from 120, 130, 150, 160, 200 and 320 feet to 85, 120, 200, 320 and 400 feet; towers will be permitted over a podium of 85 or 120 feet; the highest towers will be permitted in the vicinity of the Market Street/Van Ness Avenue intersections.


In the Transit-Oriented Neighborhood Commercial Use Districts (NCT), height districts will change from 50, 80 and 105 feet to primarily 55, 65 and 85 feet; these districts will be located in SoMa West and along Market Street. The NCT district will largely replace C-M and NC-3 districts. In the NCT district, parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing above ground-floor retail uses. These districts will largely keep the existing specific use-size controls in place in the NC-3 district. Some heights on some parcels near Brady Street will change from 105 and 60 feet to 40 feet and 85 feet on parcels surrounding a proposed public open space.


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Adopt a Draft Resolution amending the Zoning Map.
 


NOTE: On March 22, 2007, following public testimony, the Commission closed public hearing and passed a motion of intent to adopt/approve by a vote of +4 –1.
