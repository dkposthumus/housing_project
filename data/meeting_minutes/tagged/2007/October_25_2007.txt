Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 I am a member of the San Francisco Museum and Historical Society and just wanted to mention the excellent publication that they do in the Argonaut.


-
 
 There are many historical groups in the California Historical Society, SPUR and others who have excellent newsletters.


-
 
 This is particularly good and there is an article by James Haas on Mayor Edward Taylor who had a real significant role in San Francisco History in the great architectural section on the buildings that were built in the 20's in downtown San Francisco.


-
 
 I just think that this is excellent reading and I am really impressed with the things they have in many of the articles.
 
 They have a lot of significance for planning issues and they deal with a lot of historical issues too.


-
 
 My second comment: 
 
I was happy to be a guest at the Mission Language and Occupational School's 39
th
 Annual Dinner last Friday night.


-
 
 I was really impressed by this organization and their principles emphasize their students to strive for English proficiency, homeownership, College education, and financial prudence.


-
 
 I think they are a positive force with these guidance principles and I think it was worthy to mention it because like so many things we hear problems and we do not hear about the success stories.


-
 
 Thank you for my host and for being in that group.


Commissioner Olague


-
 
 
I think my question is partially directed to the City Attorney.


-
 
 
I have been receiving calls from members of the public who are concerned about the vote of the Community College Trustees last week that exempted them from local planning and zoning ordinances when it comes to the Chinatown City College Campus.


-
 
 
They were asking me and I did not know what to answer.


-
 
 
Is there a way that as a Planning Commissioner I could challenge that decision?


-
 
 
It seems, to me, that it is sort of irresponsible in a way to not at least ask the question given the design of the project that I saw here goes outside of what is in place currently in the code.


-
 
 
I was wondering if there is a way that I can challenge that.


Kate Stacey, Deputy City Attorney


-
 
 The California Government Code certainly allows a challenge in court of the decision to exempt done in arbitrary or in a capricious decision.


-
 
 Litigation is one route for individuals or an entity to pursue with that decision.


-
 
 It is also my understanding that the CEQA process is not yet completed and there still remains project approval.


-
 
 The City as an entity and individuals can certainly still have a role in that CEQA process and on the mitigation measure and ultimately litigation is open to the City as well as individuals on the approval of the project in the CEQA review.


-
 
 As a third possibility, I am not certain of what the City's role may be, there may ultimately be the need to procure encroachment permits from the City for use of the streets or the sidewalks in which the City has a proprietor interest and that may also be another role for the City to play in the future.


-
 
 At this point in challenging that decision simply to exempt themselves from City zoning and building ordinances, it is most likely to be in court.


Commissioner Moore


-
 
 Thanked Commissioner Olague for bringing this up; I would fully support the challenge and I want to express my great disappointment about this particular decision.


-
 
 I believe that Planning staff has created a really convincing case of why this really was way outside and there were many alternatives of putting a reasonable building on that site.


-
 
 There were other architects that made suggestions and I fully support any action which legally could be taken in court to challenge this decision.


-
 
 Second point:
 
 I would like to thank Mr. Badiner for preparing a memorandum to the Commission regarding the Academy of Arts University Compliance Proposal.


-
 
 While we are not discussing that today, I fully support everything summarized in the outline.


-
 
 The one thing I hear is that the City will not be able to levy any fines against this cross violations of the Code and so many cases that almost hardly there is any precedence to it.


-
 
 I think Mr. Badiner, perhaps you and the City are investigating ways to kind of basically create a precedence that this is not going to happen again and be able to find ways to levy fines.


-
 
 This set the worse precedence ever in the City of San Francisco and anybody could imitate that without a lot of challenges.


-
 
 Basically, that is acknowledging and commending you for that.


-
 
 I have another issue which I actually have consciously observed for the last couple of weeks walking downtown during lunch or rush hour time.


-
 
 I realized that shuttle services are provided for employees and students like Bank of America, Bay Club, Sports Facilities and several large apartment buildings.


-
 
 The Academy does that with quite large buses.
 
 Is that supposed to be a mitigating measure for traffic impact?
 
 I think it has turned into the opposite.


-
 
 I was standing at the corner of Montgomery and Mission Streets yesterday at lunch time and I went through two cycles of traffic light changes with one bus of the academy blocking the intersection.


-
 
 A bus that is supposed to have at least 20-25 students had only one student in it.


-
 
 I find that unacceptable because it really creates the opposite of what is intended.
 
 I think it needs to be re-examined.


-
 
 I do not know the conditions by which it was done but I think this is the time to really reinvestigate that.


Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator


-
 
 We will add that to our study of the Academy of Art and I would like to acknowledge your  thank you' and actually pass it along to Scott Sanchez who really has done the hard work on that.


Commissioner W. Lee


-
 
 This is regarding the Russian Hill Community Association – John Bardis.


-
 
 We are getting all these emails regarding notification and what I would like to do is to [request] from Mr. Badiner if you can formally write them a letter that the Planning Commission made the decision on it and that the next step would be the Board of Permit Appeals?


Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator


-
 
 I actually reviewed a letter today that Adam Light drafted in response to their letter of October 5
th
 and we just received another letter either yesterday or today.


-
 
 I asked them to incorporate those changes or any additional information. 
 
I think that letter should be on the way out today or tomorrow.


-
 
 Essentially that acknowledges their letter and why we do not think that additional notice is necessary.


Commissioner W. Lee


-
 
 The City Attorney's Office will review the letter and conquer with your interpretation, right?


Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator


-
 
 
We did not review it with the City Attorney; the interpretation that I made the City Attorney commented on it last week.


-
 
 
It is within my jurisdiction and I typically do not review every letter with the City Attorney unless I believe that it is a questionable issue and need their advice.


Commissioner Sugaya


-
 
 
Following up on City College with the City Attorney; the CEQA documents as I remember is based on a proposed project which is the high rise that was presented before us.


-
 
 
Now, the City College is taking the direction of going to a two building scheme, I think, which was sort of one of the alternatives.


-
 
 
Do they have to re-do the EIR?


Kate Stacey, Deputy City Attorney


-
 
 
It would depend on of what the EIR covers. 
 
There are some criteria that would require recirculation and we can certainly take a look at the EIR and see if recirculation or additional environmental review in our view is necessary.


Commissioner Sugaya


-
 
 
I also would like to thank Scott Sanchez and Mr. Badiner for the memorandum on the Academy of Art.
 
 There are a couple of things that should also be included that I mentioned last time.


-
 
 
How many of the buildings they took over were formally residential hotels? Who were the tenants? How were they evicted?


-
 
 
Secondly, to reinforce Commissioner Moore's comments about buses and the use of buses.


-
 
 
I believe that in the front of their properties on the 1000 block of Pine Street on the South side there are no loading zones.


-
 
 
There are three to four buses at various times parked on the street waiting for students to board and it has happened to me three to four times now and it is a mess.


-
 
 
Also, I forwarded to Mr. Sanchez some observations about benches that are on City sidewalks in front of a lot of their facilities; it is small thing.


-
 
 
Also, if you could find out or coordinate with DBI on the building codes issues and find out whether there are penalties being levied and what the amount would result in.


Commissioner S. Lee


-
 
 
I just wanted to follow up on Commissioner Olague's comments about the City College exemption.


-
 
 
I am wondering if there is precedence for the Planning Department or Commission to object when UCSF or some other State mandated organizations have exempted themselves from our local planning rules and general plans.


-
 
 
That would help us as a Commission to figure out how to move forward.


Kate Stacey, Deputy City Attorney


-
 
 I personally can not remember any time when the City challenged legally the exemption question.


-
 
 The City has certainly been involved in the project themselves in working with the UCSF, San Francisco State or the School District on the project approval themselves and has had extensive comments in the CEQA process.


-
 
 The City certainly has a role in any mitigation measures that come out of the CEQA process that will fall to the City.


-
 
 As recent CEQA case law really requires entities that may otherwise be exempted to look more to the City and to reach more certainty on mitigation measures that may be in the City's authority.


-
 
 I can not personally recall going to court on just the exemption question.


Amit Ghosh, Chief Planner


-
 
 I conquer with the City Attorney; I do not remember ever challenging an exemption decision.


Commissioner S. Lee


-
 
 But in those cases, has not there been more cooperation between the sponsoring agency and the Planning Department in terms of project or CEQA review as Ms. Stacey has stated?


-
 
 I know that in Mission Bay there was a lot of cooperation between UCSF and this department.


-
 
 We had a public hearing where City College was kind enough to come and present to us and as Commissioners were dismayed as to how the project does not comply with the General Plan.


-
 
 And yet, they have gone head and said that they have the authority to exempt themselves and have the authority to adopt or certify the EIR and I believe they have.


-
 
 The question in my mind is if there is a continuous role for the Planning Department as the project moves forward?


Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator


-
 
 We will reach out to City College and let them know about our availability to work with them on their design.
 
 I have not been particularly involved, Director Macris is.


Commissioner Olague


-
 
 I support some kind of on-going dialogue and I would also like to understand what type of input the department has given to City College.


-
 
 I would like to have periodic information updates to continue to have some kind of engagement even at the Commission level.


Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 I think that any information that we can get as the project goes forward is always welcome and if we are allowed to have any input on the design without talking in terms of the mass, which seems to be a settled issue.


Commissioner Sugaya


-
 
 The mass is the issue and I do not think we ought to drop it.


-
 
 If the CEQA process needs to be looked at then maybe City College ought to be reminded that they need to look at it if the design is changed substantially.


Commissioner W. Lee


-
 
 Instead of just looking at the City College in Chinatown, we are going to take an issue with State and Federal projects and their designs.


-
 
 We should look at what is our role and we need help from the City Attorney's Office because we had a battle with the State Office Building, Mission Bay, UCSF Expansion and the bottom line is do we have jurisdiction?


-
 
 If we do not have jurisdiction, what would be our next step?
 
 We should make a broader hearing to find out what role we have as a Commission regarding State and Federal Buildings.


 


The Commission decided to schedule a special hearing on December 6

Board of Appeals


 


A-
 
 
415 Castro Street
 
–  Quickly' – On October 18 the Project Sponsor submitted a proposal that would modify the use so it is no longer a formula retail use and it would be a retail grocery with accessory take out.
 
 
Upheld the Notice of Violation.


B-
 
 
1745 Market Street
 
– This department issued a violation to a Medical Cannabis Dispensary and they wanted to proceed with the mandatory discretionary review hearing before this Commission for their permit.
 
 There are violations that do not necessarily pertain directly to the dispensary; the Code does not allow us to process permits when there is a violation on the property.
 
 
Upheld the Zoning Administrator with the condition that the letter of determination be modified to allow the case to proceed.

SPEAKERS


John Bardis


-
 
 
Requested that the Commission take action as provided by Government Code section 54954.2(a) to direct staff to continue the November 1
st
 public hearing to a future date.


-
 
 
 
Application for permit number 2005.06.16.5311 needs to comply with section 311 of the Planning Code.


Kathleen Courtney [1135 – 1139 Green Street]


-
 
 This is about the proper support and implementation of Section 311 in the Planning Code; this project should be subject to it.


Michael Yaki [City College]


-
 
 
Contrary to some statements made, the exemption is not a blanket exemption.


-
 
 
The City actually has the authority, pursuing Government Code 53094, to challenge the exemption granted to itself by City College.


Arthur Chang, San Francisco Tomorrow


-
 
 
There is State Law which required the College to request the review of their plans for the exemption of the zoning code of the City and that is the Public Resource Code 21151.2


-
 
 
Proposition M, H and as well as the Downtown Plan are being violated by the proposal that they have submitted.


Tony Gantner, North Beach Merchants Association


-
 
 
We believe in the rule of law, that history must be preserved, that neighborhoods are inviolate, that parks are sacred and that our Planning Commission must be here to uphold City Charter and defend the integrity of our neighborhoods.


-
 
 
We believe that an investigation is in order regarding City College.


Luke Obrien


-
 
 
I am here to announce the formation of a new organization called The San Francisco Coalition for Responsible Growth and within a few weeks we have established a Board of Directors and have registered with the various appropriate authorities at the City and Federal levels.


John Keogan, San Francisco Coalition for Responsible Growth


-
 
 
This organization is going to address the needs and concerns of all stakeholders in San Francisco and one of our goals is to make San Francisco a better city.


-
 
 
Only 39% of the population in San Francisco are homeowners and we would work closely with other like minded politicians and individuals to reverse that trend.

PUBLIC COMMENT ON AGENDA ITEMS WHERE THE PUBLIC HEARING HAS BEEN CLOSED


 


At this time, members of the public who wish to address the Commission on agenda items that have already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the public hearing has been closed, must do so at this time.
 
 Each member of the public may address the
 
Commission for up to three minutes.


 


SPEAKERS


Robert Gimelli


-
 
 
Deny the addition that would virtually be condominiums at 875 Post Street because it would turn the building into a mix use with tenants in SRO [Single Room Occupancy] above.


-
 
 
Although it would increase the housing stock, it would also close the door on any possibility of any negotiation or discussion between the Property Management Company and tenants to provide services or amenities to have a decent life.


 


 


 


Tracy Boxca


-
 
 
We would like you to keep in mind three things: the project adds four more units to the middle income housing stock, proposes no new parking, and it will activate the ground floor space which is dormant.


-
 
 
We contacted the Tenderloin Housing Clinic for possibilities to have amenities on the ground floor and there are no funds to do it - neither for staff or maintenance.


Rudy Colombini


-
 
 We are trying to improve peoples' lives and this is an excellent opportunity for dwelling San Franciscans to have their own homes.

Amendments to Planning Code Section 315/Inclusionary Housing: Alternative Rehabilitation for Rental
 
- 
Ordinance introduced by Supervisor Daly as part of Board File No. 070444 that would amend portions of the Planning code to allow a new alternative to meet the requirements of the Residential Inclusionary Affordable Housing ordinance
 by allowing payment to a nonprofit to acquire and rehabilitate units for permanent affordable rental housing if the number of units is 25% greater than the amount provided under the existing off-site alternative.


Preliminary Recommendation: Approval


(Continued from Regular Meeting of October 18, 2007)


 


SPEAKERS


Lois Roberts


-
 
 
I am presently living in a space that has been proposed for rehabilitation but they have not come up with that amount of money yet.


-
 
 
You would probably loose 100% of housing for people who are under rent control on rehabilitation particularly with buildings that are not considered below standard.


 


ACTION:
 
 There was no support to the recommended amendments but suggested that Supervisor Daly, the Mayor's Office of Housing and Planning Department staff continue working together on this issue.

BALBOA
PARK
STATION AREA PLAN
 
- 
Public Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR)
. 
The Planning Department-proposed Balboa Park Station Area Plan (the proposed project) includes amendments to the San Francisco General Plan and specific Planning Code changes related to zoning districts and height and bulk controls in the Project Area, which includes the area surrounding the Balboa Park Station and along Geneva, Ocean, and San Jose Avenues. The proposed project would introduce a new zoning district–NC-T (Neighborhood Commercial Transit)–into the Project Area, that would potentially increase transit-oriented mixed-use developments. Improvements to the existing streetscape, transportation system/transit facilities, open space, as well as new urban design policies may result from implementation of the Area Plan. The Area Plan also includes specific proposals for mixed-use, transit-oriented development in the Project Area at: (1) the Phelan Loop Site; and (2) the Kragen Auto Parts Site. Implementation of the Area Plan would result in a net increase of about 1,780 new residential units and about 104,680 net new gross square feet of commercial development in the Project Area by the year 2025. A net increase of about 90-200 jobs would be expected in the Project Area by the year 2025 as a result of implementation of the Area Plan.


Preliminary Recommendation: No Action Required


Note: Written comments will be accepted at the Planning Department's offices until the close of business on November 5, 2007.
