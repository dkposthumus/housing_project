PARK MERCED MIXED-USE PROJECT OVERVIEW AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT â INFORMATIONAL 
ONLY
 
- Parkmerced is generally bounded by 19
th
 Avenue to the east, Lake 
Merced Boulevard to the west, Holloway Avenue to the north, and Stanley 
Boulevard to the south.  The proposed project includes those lots owned by 
Parkmerced Investors, LLC, and includes Assessorâs Blocks 7303, 7303A, 7308-311, 
7314, 7316, 7319-26, 7330-45, 7333 A-B, 7333E & 7353-7373.  Parkmerced is a 
rental housing complex constructed between 1941-1951 consisting of approximately 
3,200 existing residential units and owned by Parkmerced Investors, LLC. 
 
This is an Informational Hearing to provide an overview of the proposed project 
components and draft Development Agreement. Specific topics to be discussed at 
this session include transportation and housing (including rent and tenant 
relocation considerations). 
The project, which would be implemented over 
20-30 years in multiple phases, includes the addition of approximately 5,700 net 
new residential units, the demolition and replacement of approximately 1,800 
existing units which would remain subject to the San Francisco Rent 
Stabilization Ordinance, rent-protections and relocation rights for existing 
tenants, re-alignment and re-design of streets and blocks, re-alignment and 
improvement of the M Ocean View light rail line, the addition of new 
neighborhood serving retail and office space, new and re-configured public open 
spaces including neighborhood parks, pedestrian and bike paths, athletic fields, 
a new organic farm, and community gardens, overall transportation improvements, 
ecological hydrology improvements, and provision of renewable energy and water 
infrastructure. The draft Development Agreement would become the binding legal 
contract between the City and the Developer and would memorialize all of the 
public benefits and obligations of the Developer and associated agreements 
between both parties toward implementation of the Project.





Preliminary Recommendation: 
No Action Requested. Informational Discussion 
Only
.
