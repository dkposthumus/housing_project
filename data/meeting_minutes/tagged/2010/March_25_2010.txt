Future Meetings/Agendas
.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.


 


Commissioner Antonini:


Read a recent article about the possibility of development for an arena in San Francisco, which is an interesting project and will pose a question to staff, I donât need the answer today, but what is our role in this? I just kind of wonder how we fit into the process of this particular property.  Even thought it is Port property, do we as a Commission have a role in this decision.  Interestingly enough, that site, I donât know the exact size of the site, but it is actually bigger than the site proposed in Santa Clara for a football stadium.  It is an interesting concept because I have spoken many times about the loss of revenue that we have when large concerts are never here because there is not a facility for them.  We canât have a national political convention; we canât even have the circus here.  They do not come to the Cow Palace.  The final four basketball games that San Jose got as part of the playoffs last weekend was because they have the arena.  The entertainment groups that I have talked to about this idea are very enthusiastic because they feel they would rather have it here in San Francisco where there is a large population


 


Commissioner Sugaya:


I noticed even though the City is supposedly broke, we got brand spanking new microphones here. I would also like to say, thinking about last weekâs hearing about 555 Washington Street, I was quite proud of the way the Planning Commission was able to articulate various points of view, both in opposition and in favor of, and in between, on the various issues that were heard in the seven-hour hearing.  Things were contentious at certain times, but I see the Commissioners involved are still talking to each other, so it probably was not as bad as anybody thought it was watching on TV.   That comment is made quite in contrast to the other Commission, who sat up here with us.  Those of you that have not seen it might be interested to see the way that Commission took their vote.  I donât need to go into that any further. That said, back on the 555 Washington Street Environmental Impact Report, it is interesting to me that as I was reading the DEIR, the project at 222 2
nd
 Street in the Land Use Analysis section it says, and I am going to quote, âa conflict between the proposed project and the General Plan Policy does not indicate a significant affect on the environment within the context of CEQA.  The staff report and Planning Commission will entertain the Planning Departmentâs full analysis of the projects consistency with the General Plan Policy and zoning and will discuss any exceptions requested or modifications required, thus the impact analysis does not evaluate planning and consistencies, although physical [combat] (?) environmental impacts that could require from such conflicts are analyzed elsewhereâ This is quite a contrast to the DEIR we had in front of us for 555 Washington Street, which took great pains to explain how the project would be in conformance with the general plan, zoning and Planning Code plans and policies because we were going to change those very policies.  Itâs seems to me that this EIR on 22
nd
 was quite a different approach.  I would like staff to sort of ponder these approaches.


Commissioner Borden:


One of the local realtors had information that I thought was interesting.  She said single-family homes in San Francisco, over the last year the median price has gone up 17%.  She also said the number of homes sold has increased 20% and the number of homes for sale has declined.  I thought it was interesting, we actually see a lot of D.R.âs with home improvement projects.  I guess the single-family home market seems to be going back up already, and I guess I was surprised to realize that.


Commissioner Lee:


We just got an email from Ms. Avery about the CEQA review, and I think we should take both of those cases and compare them, because I think we need to clarify, for transparency reasons, and for the general public to understand what we are allowed to do and what we are not allowed to do, but it goes back to the purpose of CEQA.


I would like to take both of them and dissect them and look at where we are weak or strong with either one.  Still, the bottom line, does it meet the CEQA requirement is key to the decision making.


Commissioner Miguel:


I am not positive about the date, but I believe it was the âBusiness Timesâ of March 5 that had an interesting article regarding community housing partnerships.  They housed formerly homeless individuals in San Francisco, which is something that has been brought up here at the Commission from time to time.  They claim that 98% of people they house did not go back to the streets.  They are involved in joint projects and their own individual projects.  If you could get a hold of that, it was an interesting article.


We have, as we mentioned here in the City, started a number of small little public plazas.  There are three with more to come around town.  The reference was to how they were doing it in New York.  Those public plazas, as started last May, now they have been made permanent.  They were temporary before.  They have been made permanent and there is good reason to keep their existence.  Once in a while I mention something I have read which is interesting.  I have followed one way or another Steward Brand, for years.  He has a new publication out â I donât always agree with the author, but I always find him relatively easy to read for a scientist, and someone who is willing to change his mind, which is also interesting to read.  He has comments on population, environment, and density of population, and they would relate to some of the things that we do here.  


In addition to that, I had a long conversation with Supervisor Eric Mar regarding the Alexandria Theater, which has been languishing for some time. Supervisor Mar is trying to figure out what is happening with that, as the rest of us are.  As far as Commissioner Antonini âs comments on the possible stadium location, actually that was talked about as a possible stadium many years ago, and there was no traction on it.  Unfortunately, there were a number of us, including myself that tried to get a little action on it, but nobody wanted to step forward, unfortunately.


Commissioner Antonini:


 Well, I read about that and I remembered that it was coming at the time when the Warriors were for sale and it was also taught that their lease would expire in 2017.  Incidentally, this could be privately financed, as everything pretty much is today. I wanted to mentioned at lastâs week discussion, 555 Washington, one thing that was noteworthy and I will have to try to locate, there was an individual who came up â wanting that was noteworthy, he came up with interesting statistics about how many there are available and that theyâre selling quickly.  In fact, they were looking at the possibility of there being a shortage as early as 2011, because they project what the rate of sale has been and how many are left.  These are new condominiums. I think that would be interesting because these discussions come up all the time.  If we could get information from him and substantiate whether he is accurate or not; and there was also an article that dealt with the same question, I believe, in the âBusiness Timeâ or âThe Chronicleâ or âExaminerâ, as we approved projects and consider project entitlement extensions, we are always hearing discussion about is there an oversupply or under supply of available housing and a certain type of housing - so it is good to know what we have.


Commissioner Miguel:


As to Commissioner Bordenâs comments on prices and Commissioner Antoniniâs last comment, one of the members of my family has been shopping in San Francisco for a condo, and I think both of these comments are quite accurate.


 


 


D.         DIRECTORâS REPORT


 


9.         Directorâs Announcements


            


Director Rahaim:


In a quick respond to Commissioner Antoniniâs request, the Department is involved in the environmental review, but the Commission as it is structured now did not approve the project on this piece of land.  I sat on the advisory committee.  The original proposal was much bigger, but the capacity is for more than the Arena.  It is for other types of mixed used developments.  Typically we are involved at the staff level, and working with the Port.  But as it stands right now there is not a formal role for us.  That could change as we move forward in structuring this type of zoning.


I wanted to mention the CEQA training that someone brought up.  We were specifically asked to work with staff to develop training sessions for both commissions and other topics, for that matter, related to the code and general plan as well.  It seems that CEQA was the most pressing need, so we are trying to organize that.


Tuesday night I attended a meeting at San Francisco Beautiful with Sarah Dennis, to talk specifically about the housing element and the draft of the element that we have prepared.  We had some comments on that.  The draft EIR for the housing element is due next month.  Our hope was to have the final element planned by mid-summer, but that will depend on how long it takes to respond to the number of comments we get.  Probably in May we will have a hearing.


I also wanted to mention the parkâs program that the Commission brought up.  There was a ribbon cutting last week. In this case we are looking at several other locations, rather than taking a part of the street right of way, the plan was developed to use parking spaces for a platform. It has met with great success, I think.


Again, I want to give kudos to the staff that has really made this possible from almost every aspect of it. This includes fund raising, finding furniture, planting plants and all sorts of things.


Finally, I just wanted to mention that I will be out of the office next week.  I have been invited to attend a seminar in Honolulu with an organization called the Eastwood Institute that has been around for a quite a while.  They provide cooperation between different countries, a number of them will be Planning and Economic Directors from several countries, and three US cities - San Francisco, Seattle and Denver will be involved. 


Alicia John-Baptiste, will be in charge of the Department while I am away. 


 


Commissioner Olague:


When will the draft EIR for the Housing Element will be ready?


Director Rahaim:


I do not have an exact date, sometime in late April.  


Commissioner Olague:


I noticed in the advance calendar that there is an EIR hearing on 935 Market Street.  Do you know when it might be available?


Director Rahaim:


 I do not. Again, thereâs a 30 day gap between when it will be released and when we have the hearing.

Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.


 


Land Use Committee:


This week at the Land Use Committee, the Development Reform package was before the Committee.


Three ordinances in the Commissionâs package on January 21, two resolutions were passed. Both of them recommended approval with various modifications.  12 in all were recommended, including things such as looking at the projects in the pipeline that could be included and open to legislation; wanting to capture additional fees; and the securing of the additional infrastructure funding.


I am pleased to report that the Mayorâs Office has integrated the ordinances from this week. 


Requesting that the Board help to stimulate construction, there were members of the planned area in the Supervisorsâ Committee that wanted to ensure that the infrastructure funding was not delayed.  


Summing up thoughts with a few comments, Supervisor Maxwell, thought it was important to defer fees to help with development as long as they come at the same time as housing provision.  She also stated that the below market units before in important component to securing great neighborhoods and she wanted to make sure that nothing about the deferral program, especially affordable housing transfer, would undermine the program.  She finally commented that it was not accepted until the City secures the infrastructure.  


Also before the Land Use Committee was Supervisor Chiuâs requirement for putting a garage into an existing building.  At the January 14 hearing approval modifications were recommended, including legislation to be used for a different criteria starting with dwelling units; off street parking; on street parking and the design done through DPW/MTA and your recommendations were incorporated into the revisions that went before the Land Use Committee


            
Board of Appeals:


There was a hearing on a Medical Cannabis case that failed to meet the pre-existing deadline.  Members of the Board struggled to allow this to continue, as did we, but I do not think that the law allowed it to happen.  They continued the item for a number of weeks so that they can continue examining it and have the project sponsor there.


There were some allegations that the Department did not do as much as they could to help the applicant but I took an exception to that. We spent a lot of time and energy on this. 


There were also allegations of racisms in doing this.  I do take exception to this.  I am upset about it but that did not come from the commission, but from member of the audience.  The Department did the best they could and the applicantâs told them many times that they missed the deadline.  When you miss the deadline, the law changes regarding the within a 1000 feet of a school.  It was very problematic.


I will also be out of the office next week.


Historic Preservation Commission:


No meeting this week.


I would to note that because there was no report last week, the Commission met on Wednesday 3/17.  On their calendar was the Mission Dolores Neighborhood survey document prepared by Carey and Company.  An interesting situation - staff did not recommend total adoption of the survey.  It was more of a partial approval, but the Commission actually adopted the survey that the consultant put forward.  The Commission also wanted to talk about how the Department could find designations to work thru that piece of work.

Review
 of Building Permit Application No. 2009.06.23.1112 proposing to expand the existing 2-unit building by constructing horizontal additions at the second and a vertical expansion at the third floors to raise the height by approximately 5-feet. The property is located within an RH-3 (Residential House, Three Units per Lot) Zoning District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District. This project triggers open space, rear yard, and non-complying structure variances.


Preliminary Recommendation: Do Not Take Discretionary Review and approve as proposed.

Request for Open Space, Rear Yard, and Non-Complying Structure Variances,
 to allow horizontal additions at the second and third floors and a vertical addition to the existing third floor. The construction at the second and third floor extends within the required rear yard of the existing non-complying structure, which triggers rear yard and non-complying structure variances. The further expansion within the required rear yard also lessens the required open space and would therefore require an open space variance. The property is located within an RH-3 (Residential House, Three Units per Lot) Zoning District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District. The Variance decision will be issued following the Commission's consideration of the Discretionary Review request.


 


SPEAKERS:     Same as those listed for item 15a


ACTION:           The Variance requests need to be re-noticed for Zoning Administrator consideration.

Consideration of adoption of a Resolution of Intention to initiate amendments to the General Plan, Planning Code, and Zoning Map
, pursuant to Planning Code sections 302(b) and 340(c) related to proposed amendments to the Bayview Hunters Point Redevelopment Plan and the Hunters Point Shipyard Redevelopment Plan.  Together, the proposed amendments would implement the 
Bayview Jobs, Parks and Housing Initiative (Proposition G)
 certified on June 28, 2008 by the Department of Elections by allowing large-scale mixed-use multi-modal development.  As proposed the Project would include approximately 10,500 dwelling units, 885,000 square feet of retail, 150,000 square feet of office, 3,000,000 square feet of research and development, a new 69,000 seat football stadium, performance arena, arts center and artists studios, 336 acres of open space and parks (inclusive of a dual use field stadium parking lot), among other uses.   In the event the 49ers do not avail themselves of the opportunity to build a new stadium in the Project, the Project includes a non-stadium program that would expand both the research and development and residential uses on some of the areas of the Shipyard currently reserved for stadium uses, slightly reduce residential densities on Candlestick Point, and slightly reduce the total amount of open space on the Shipyard.
  
The project requires several actions by the Planning Commission, the Redevelopment Commission the Board of Supervisors, among other decision-making bodies, including conforming amendments to the General Plan, Planning Code and Zoning Map of the Planning Code. The following Planning Commissions actions are proposed at this public hearing:
