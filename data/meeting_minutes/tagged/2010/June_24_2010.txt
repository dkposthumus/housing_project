Commissioner Moore
:


-
         
Last week we had people from the neighborhood bringing concerns to the Commission which inadvertently were left out of the Market-Octavia Plan which stands amidst zoning which is 
governed by a new plan but these properties actually refer to old zoning. It is both neighbors as well as developers who bring to our attention that there is an inevitable conflict which will 
be arising when the project, some of which are apparently getting ready to come before us, 
are going to be before us because there will be people disagreeing with it because the majority of 


-
         
people believe that the Market-Octavia Plan is comprehensive, and is forward-looking and in a way reflects what we want for San Francisco.  We want neighborhood and urban design plans to improve individual projects in the interest of what the Commission does and planning does and how we all work together. With this in mind, I would like to have the Commission take an advanced look at where the commonalties and the differences are of what governors this area to we avoid difficulties for us later on rather than drawn out approval for losses or whatever. I ask the Commission to schedule a meeting. I'm asking the President, and asking for the commissioners' support.


-
         
 I think it's in our interest to take us through the pros and con of what we can have as well as ourselves and everybody else along the battle. 


-
         
The next thing is I have an interesting article of John King writing about a walk he took with a Paul Goldberg, respected architectural critic that took a look after he in his early college years wasn't quite as impressed by the City.  The most important thing that strikes me is Goldberger's acknowledge about the urban quality of San Francisco and what he sees we are doing or some of our plans are doing to really put San Francisco on the map as a city, which is personally very important to me.


     Commissioner Antonini
:     


-    A couple of items I was happy to see today reported a Berkley firm and most of you may have seen his in the paper regarding a move away from suburban sprawl and that was in keeping with what we have been doing here in many of our decisions and what's equally important to the concept of housing near businesses is to make sure that businesses think about relocating closer to where the employees are and particularly I talk in terms of the tech firms and others have many employees who have to be bussed to places on the peninsula and in the South Bay because they live in San Francisco, and we have the available square footage of commercial space and a lot of availability to do more. This is a sign that people are starting to get the picture and with a great transit we have and the great business center we have here already and the opportunity for campus-type buildings and Mission Bay and other sites, this is a good sign. 


-     One other comment is I wanted to ask if we can adjourn in memory of Jillian Costello, courageous young woman, who died this morning.  She was on the U.C. Women's Crew Team and was diagnosed a year ago with lung cancer at age 21 and courageously went on even through her illness to compete and serve as coxen for the pac10 Championship and second in the Nation. I think she is a great example of courage and I would like to adjourn in her honor.
Jillian Costello.


Commissioner Olague
:


-    We have two draft EIR hearings coming up one on CPMC and Treasure Island and the tentative date is August 12, but I believe that one of our Commissioners may not be present for that hearing date, so I am going to ask if there is another date to bring back one that we have previously canceled and September 2 I'm going to ask.  Are people going to be â the night is Roshanna and the 2
nd
 of September date is whether or not we are moving forward a, the only other time that might work for the E.I.R., is to be a September 16 hearing. I don't know. And unless there is a time in late August, like the last of August and the last week in August, what dates are we scheduled to cancel? and the 19th and the and the 26th is there a full Commission on August 26? I guess we'll have to figure this one out then for those two projects, Treasure Island and the draft CPMC hearing I believe we need a full commission in place and I am concerned if the public has the opportunity to review those documents and I think it will involve more than the campus with St. Luke's and other issues that we are engaged in the conversations and I don't know if we can figure out something that's workable, but we need a full commission and need to honor the publics on some levels since it is the summer months and so we have close to what is a 90-day review period and a respectable thing to do. I didn't want to bring it up, but I felt I needed to before everyone books their vacations.


Director Rahaim:


-     On the CPMC project, I have asked the staff to extend it the comment period to 60 days beyond the normal 45, there is an issue of having long break and what I would ask the commission to consider if there were projects that could beard and if they are not taking action, there is the E.I.R. hearing.


Commissioner Antonini
:   I'm here whenever you want to meet, so that's fine with me. And I wasn't quite sure but in terms of the second, did I hear that wasn't a viable possibility? But that would be fine with me. I know secretary Avery is gone on the second hearing, that would work for me and also I believe there is the fifth Thursday, is there not, that is available in July, and that would mean that perhaps we have the hearing date a little bit sooner and that might be a problem with moving that the largest E.I.R.'s wouldn't be ready. The second works for me and any other time we can try to do it, as well as the last week in August 5 that is acceptable.


 
Commissioner Moore
:


-
         
When we discussed the annual calendar, I think everybody admitted something one commission meeting right before the September holiday is difficult because most people
are gone and taking advantage of an occurrence which you normally don't have.
When we set the calendar, some people made long-range plans for slightly longer, extended availability to go away with the family or whatever they will do, and while I'm normally not opposed to being flexible, I can't do it then. I was going to bring up the 29th for taking care of other matters because on the 5th when CPMC is scheduled there are a number of other items and I tend to think that the comments on the draft E.I.R. would be extensive and not to have that
on a day with a bunch of other items -- staff actually advertises things for those later dates, so it's really difficult to move them forward. We can move them later without a problem, but moving them forward is going to create a problem and whatever date we hear the CPMC hearing or have it as one of the few items on the calendar and hearing that they have been lengthy and can anticipate it will be several hours in length. I won't be here op July 29, and what we're likely to do is move the Treasure Island to the morning and then reserve most of the afternoon to CPMC to have the entire afternoon.


President Miguel
:   


-   What I forgot to say is the Housing Element would move up to August 5, that's not a good idea. I don't support that. I may not be here on August 5 and I think it's not even time to review that document. My recommendation rather than having discussion here, we will have a new calendar. 


-    I
t is too much to ask the public to review the Treasure Island document, the CPMC and the Housing Element document in the month of July. It's not realistic for me and I don't think it's realistic for the public. And the housing element is gigantic.


-  We will deal with this next week, and wanted to mention I have during the last week met with USF and the neighborhood association. I agree with commissioner Moore that a discussion regarding the few block of Upper Market which were not, by the way, inadvertently left out of the Market Octavia plan. In fact, four blocks were included in that and were originally intended by the Department and there was an Upper Market plan going to Castro Street that was being developed by the Department and also last week or this week I should say what are the new time forums was quite interesting on the financing of the housing that was well done and had the pleasure of going from a representative there dealing with the area to the Department set up and myself and generality and it was 50 to 70 people in the audience and very gratifying that so many people are interested in those subjects.


- One of the things is at the request of the neighbors have agreed to them and that
meeting is not set and will be a couple of week down the road and would be most helpful to have your hearing after I meet with the community, but that meeting is not set yet.
it's probably two to three weeks down the road. 


Commissioner Moore
:


 -    Expect staff has that on their fingertips.  


Commissioner Borden
:


 - As far as putting this out there I am happy to have a date and set it there.


Commissioner Sugaya
:


-    To meet with the neighborhood groups since that's been requested.


President Miguel
:


-    We have several items in front of us and if the director and the secretary can discus these and in effect check with the commissioners and see whether or not we're going to have sufficient quorum available that we still have a week or so certainly in which to do that rather than try and do it right here.


-  I think we're going to do it, but trying to get everyone's schedule together
which for the department and seven of us is not the easiest thing in the world. We will do that or next week. There is a project in that district that is scheduled to come to you in the next couple of weeks I believe.

BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:


      
This week the Board's attention is largely to the budget. There will be no Land Use Committee meeting until July 12. 


      The other significant item that happened is part two of the development stimulus package.
-- The first part of the package included an article four and the fee for consolidation were standardized as well as the development of a rigorous collection system. For part two introduced this week includes two resolutions and a related joint community facilities agreement. The first r resolution is a resolution approving the formation of a community facilities district and the second is an air plan infrastructure finance committee and these are both resolutions. The first is introduced by the Mayor and Supervisor Duffy and the second by Supervisor Maxwell both of the resolutions to be heard by you on July 22. That concludes my board.

Public Hearing on an Appeal of the Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration. 
The approximately 80,000-square-foot project site is on the Main Campus of the University of San Francisco, in the existing Harney Green and Harney Plaza area. The proposed project includes removal of Harney Green and Plaza; site excavation; and construction of a three-story with a partial fourth floor, 53-foot high building with a partial basement, which would connect on all floors to the south end of the existing Harney Science Building, and a below-grade, two-level structure, which is also a component of the proposed project.  The roof of this building would serve as a new plaza and pedestrian area.   Together, the new structures would have approximately 60,000 square feet of classrooms, laboratories, instrumentation rooms, and building mechanical/support spaces. The project site is within an RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District and an 80-D Height and Bulk District.  The proposed project would require Conditional Use Authorization for a post-secondary institutional use in an RH-2 District, and for exceeding a building height of 40 feet in an R District.
