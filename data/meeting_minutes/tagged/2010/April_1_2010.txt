Inquiries/Announcements

Future Meetings/Agendas
.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.


 


Commissioner Antonini:


-   I am interested in a timetable for Transbay. He heard that there was a problem with AC Transit not wanting to begin running their buses into the temporary terminal until they have a definite date of completion of the new terminal.


-  The USA Iowa, the ship upon which President Roosevelt went to the Cairo and Tehran conference in 1943 and how this might be something to look into, particularly with the development of Pier 70 and Hunterâs Point Shipyard.  These are great places that have great tourist interest because the ships we have here have attracted tourists because we have a nautical background. 


-  In the same vein, there is a scoping meeting at India Basin on the 7
th
 of April, and it will be good a thing for Commissioners and others to attend because it is such an important area.  It is an area adjacent to the Bayview Hunterâs Point and probably will be developed at the same time.


-  Along those lines, I was contacted by someone who has a product that we are going to be looking at. I think the city might be interested in this multi-use turf that has been promoted as a really good use, and has also been used for athletic fields.  This particular firm just did Georgia Tech, which is a great example. If you are familiar with it, itâs right in the middle of Atlanta and somewhat space constricted.


-  Finally, we have been hearing more about this possible arena in San Francisco and for those who has been watching the NC2 basketball play offs, a number of the sites have been in the Bay Area, but havenât been in San Francisco.  Itâs a national event that brings a lot of fans and revenue in, and is another reason to look further.


Commissioner Olague:


-  A few months ago I asked for a hearing, some item or presentation on the Mid-Market area from staff.  I understand there was a Mid-Market meeting, a Redevelopment meeting this week.


-  I was wondering if it is time to start scheduling that hearing, if they are starting to talk about reviving the pack.  Maybe I misinterpreted what I was told.


-  Then we have the Market Street project coming up as well as the Yerba Buena and these other issues.


-  Also, I just want to re-assure members of  the public, I know a couple weeks after we had an extremely long hearing and a coupled of us went out to get food, we got food for ourselves and for the Commissioners and were gone 45 minutes to an hour, but with technology now days you can actually watch the hearing from remote places.  Ideally we should have been here physically, but the hearing was long, and if we take breaks at the same time that means everybody has to wait that much longer to hear their items.  So we thought the best thing was to go eat and get food for everyone and bring it back.  We were watching the hearing on a blackberry and on a laptop, and we did hear the testimonies.  


   I want to re-assure the members of the public that sometimes if we arenât here physically, we will hear it in the back room where we eat, or on a blackberry or on a computer.  But that was a rare situation and one we would usually try to avoid, but when the hearings are unusually long, sometimes itâs unavoidable.


Commissioner Moore:


-  
I would like to ask the Department, we have two projects coming up, Treasure Island and Bayview Hunterâs Point, where Planning in conjunction with Redevelopment is using a hybrid of form-based code.


-
  The City has little or no experience in projects which have used that particular technique, and I would be curious to hear both Departments of planning to talk to us about that, and I really want to see examples on how itâs working, what is done to prepare for it, etc., in order for myself at a minimum to be comfortable that we know how form-based code stands next to the traditional Ukrainian code we use in zoning and land use.


Commissioner Lee:


-  Last week we had our hearing with the wireless system. I called the Health Department and tried to get some information on health issues, because it appeared to me that the public doesnât know exactly what the health issues are, or what the position of EPA is.  I asked if the Commissioners, that maybe if they have questions, they call in. But then for the general public, maybe Planning and the Health Department could have an open forum.  There are indications that there are about 25,000 sites with radiation from radio waves and telephones, and these are found too much â most studies have indicated that cell antennas use less than 1% of the FCC requirement.


- The EIR re. Candlestick:  I think thatâs also Hunterâs Point.  There is this whole issue about a super fund site.  If the Commissioners have questions, they should contact him, I donât know if we are going to have a hearing regarding the super fund site and the relationship with the State Board or the Resources Control Board and State and local enforcement agencies, but there appears to be a lot of questions regarding toxics.


Commissioners Antonini:


-  I want to thank the Commissionâs Secretary for a memo she sent last week regarding our calendar over the next couple of months.  I will be here and I am pretty much in favor of that.


- There have been commentaries by some members of the public that we have a significant number of items and we should have as many hearings as they want. 


Commissioner Olague:


-  With the WTS stuff, I am hoping that maybe â I talk to â I just thought it might be good idea to approach one of the Supervisors and ask if the Land Use Committee might be interested in having a more informed discussion with Public Health and Planning.  I think thereâs a lot of information on the part of the public that we could all use on the subject.  There are times when we have certain constraints, as far as our approval process.


Commission Secretary:


- If I can respond to that aspect of it.  The reason I sent the e-mail to all of you was to get your schedules, so that I could schedule these hearings.  I would appreciate if all of you would respond and let me know your availability from now through August.


Commissioner Moore:


- A comment vice President Olague made that rattled my mind on the question of the calendar for meetings: I have for a long time been asking the Director to provide us in printed form a calendar of community meetings, Department outreach meetings, workshops, or events regarding land use issues such as Market Street, or whatever it might be.  That just helps us to choose what each us wants to do.  Maybe not all 7 of us, but we would have an idea of what is going on and what we would like to participate in before they happen.


Commission Secretary:


-  I can control your advance calendars, but I canât control what happens out in the neighborhoods or what the rest of the Department is doing.  I donât have access to all of that.  I can try to pull it together for you.  I know that the Director was working on putting something together.  I donât know if his secretary was doing that or not, but I will check in with him and see how we can better make that available.


Commissioner Lee:


- Recently we got economic information that we are going to have a second downturn in the economy beginning in 2012 because the stimulus money will be spent.  The Census will be employing 750 people between now and the end of the year.  Given that we have our highest unemployment rate in San Francisco in the last 40 years.  Are there any plans that we can expedite, large plans to be approved this year?  Even if that happens, it takes about another year before they go through the complete building process.  


Commissioner Moore:


- Mr. Nikitas, I donât want to put you on the spot, but as a senior staff, are you aware of the comings and going of those meetings, are you aware of any part of those meeting that you could give Secretary Avery the information? 


Craig Nikitas, Acting Zoning Administrator
:


- Typically what happen is we share upcoming meeting in the week at a senior management meeting on Mondayâs mornings, individual managers know about the meeting regarding the projects or the areas they are managing, but we donât have a centralized database of the upcoming meetings and I think it would be valuable to pursue that and see what we can do both to accommodate your request and spread the knowledge throughout staff.


Commissioner Miguel:


- I had some meetings during the past week regarding Bayview Hunters Point as well as India Basin, and there is an India Basin meeting coming up next week.  I have also had some meetings with the Rebuild the Potrero project, and spent some time over several phones calls and e-mails yesterday with our secretary trying to schedule the informational hearings on Bayview Hunters Point in advance of an actual joint hearing with Redevelopment, so we can be as much up to date as possible.  Scheduling at any time it concerns two different commissions is difficult, but I think we have finally got this one down.

BOARD OF SUPERV ISORS:


-
         
There was an ordinance on the Parking Requirements and Garage Installation in Existing Buildings in District 3 (Telegraph Hill, North Beach and Chinatown).  At the January 14
th
 hearing, the Planning Commission recommended approval of this ordinance with modifications.  Since that time, Supervisor Chiu did incorporate the majority of your recommendations.  However, last week many amendments were made after dialogue with Supervisor Dufty and interested parties.  This week it contained the special use district, bans on certain streets, but it was also amended as follows:  the addition of new garages would require 311 notification; buildings with four or more would require a mandatory DR hearing; a signed affidavit from the Project Sponsor they are meeting requirements; and the Department would be required to verify there have been no âno-faultâ evictions, among other things.  The ordinance was passed out of the Land Use Committee this week with recommendations for approval.


-
         
Also before the Land Use Committee was the Green Landscaping Ordinance.  This would create a permeability requirement, additional street tree and screening requirements, among other items.  With amendments, the Committee passed the ordinance to the full Board with a recommendation for approval.


-
         
There was also a Comprehensive Street Frontage Ordinance.  This ordinance would apply some of the street frontage controls from recent planning efforts to additional zoning districts in the City.  The Land use Committee recommended approval this week.

Amendments relating to the Police Code to create a Prohibition on Sitting or Lying on City Sidewalks [BOS File No. 10-0233].
  
Ordinance introduced by Mayor Newsom and Supervisor Alioto-Pier that would amend the Police Code to create a new Section168 that would prohibit sitting or lying on City sidewalks.  
The proposed ordinance would make it unlawful to sit or lie upon a public sidewalk, or upon a blanket, chair, stool, or any other object placed upon a public sidewalk, during the hours between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. at night. The Planning Commission specifically requested: 1) analysis of how the proposed law compares with adopted policy in San Franciscoâs General Plan; 2) analysis of how the proposed Ordinance would affect the Cityâs Pavement to Parks program; and 3) information on jurisdictions with similar laws nationwide.  The proposed Ordinance is before the Commission at the request of the Commission so that it may make recommendations to the Board of Supervisors.


 


SPEAKERS:     Nicolas King, Chief   - SF Police Department, Ernestine Weiss, Bob â Coalition on Homelessness; Laura , Ted Lowenberg â HAIA, Nate Miller, James Jonitas


ACTION:           Approved staff's recommendation that the City maintain the streets and sidewalks as a vital component of the City's open space system adding amendments that highlight the General Plan policies to provide services to the homeless; realize that there are issues relative to SRO tenants who might want to leave their small space to obtain fresh air and open space on the sidewalks in front of or in the areas surrounding where they live; and to recognize the dynamics of the day-labor program where the use of sidewalks is often necessary.
