Impact 
Report
 
- The project site is located on about 152 acres of land adjacent to Lake Merced 
(Assessors Block 7303-001, 7303-A-001, 7308-001, 7309-001, 7309-A-001, 7310-001,

7365-001, 7366-001, 7367-001, 7368-001, 7369-001, and 7370-001). The Proposed 
Project would increase residential density, provide new commercial and retail 
services, modify transit facilities, and improve utilities within the site. A 
new Pre K-5 school and day care facility, a fitness center, and new open space 
uses, would also be provided. About 1,683 of the existing apartments located in 
11 tower buildings would be retained. Over a period of approximately 20 years, 
the remaining 1,538 existing apartments would be demolished and replaced, and an 
additional 5,679 net new units would be added, resulting in a total of about 
8,900 units on the site. The transportation system modifications would include 
rerouting the existing Muni Metro M Ocean View line through the development. 
Infrastructure improvements would include the installation renewable energy 
sources, such as wind turbines and photovoltaic cells.  The Proposed Project 
would require amendments to the San Francisco Planning Code and the 


San 
Francisco General Plan.
  
The Planning Code amendments would change the Height and Bulk District Zoning 
Map and would add a Special Use District (SUD) applicable to the entire Project 
Site.  A Development Agreement is also proposed, which would be accompanied by 
the proposed 


Parkmerced Design 
Standards and Guidelines
 
with specific development guidelines. The transportation improvements would 
require approval of the San Francisco Municipal Transit Authority, the 
California Public Utilities Commission, and Caltrans.
 
The Draft EIR identified potentially significant, unavoidable environmental 
impacts on aesthetics, historic architectural resources, transportation, noise, 
air quality, wind and biological resources.

Recommendation: Certify the Final Environmental Impact Report

 - 
Informational Hearing
 

Informational Hearing
 on the proposed amendments to the Executive Park Subarea Plan of 
the Bayview Hunters Point Area Plan and development proposals:  The 71-acre 
Executive Park Subarea Plan Area is a subarea of the 
Bayview Hunters Point 
Area Plan, 
located in the southeastern part of San Francisco, just east of 
U.S. Highway 101 and along the San Francisco/San Mateo County boundary.    The

vibrant, predominately residential neighborhood and would address land use, 
streets and transportation, urban design, community facilities and services, and 
recreation and open space issues.  In association with the Plan amendments, 
proposed design guidelines would be established for buildings, streets, 
pathways, and parking, as well as âgreen buildingâ approaches.   These 
amendments are being proposed in association with two development proposals that 
would include up to 1,600 dwelling units and other associated uses in 
approximately thirteen buildings.

EXECUTIVE PARK AMENDED SUBAREA PLAN AND THE YERBY COMPANY AND 
UNIVERSAL PARAGON CORPORATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS (PROJECT)
 
Public Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Report 



 - Public Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Report
:  
The 71-acre 
Executive Park Subarea Plan Area is a subarea of the 
Bayview Hunters Point 
Area Plan, 
located in the southeastern part of San Francisco, just east of 
U.S. Highway 101 and along the San Francisco/San Mateo County boundary. The 
proposed project consists of amendments to the General Plan, the Executive Park 
Subarea Plan of the 
Bayview Hunters Point Area Plan, 
Planning Code, and 
Zoning Map to provide for the transition of the existing office park development 
within a 14.5-acre southern portion of the Subarea Plan Area to a new, primarily 
residential area.  The amended Subarea Plan (Plan) would establish objectives 
and policies to create a vibrant, predominately residential neighborhood and 
would address land use, streets and transportation, urban design, community 
facilities and services, and recreation and open space issues.  In association 
with the Plan amendments, design guidelines would be established for buildings, 
streets, pathways, and parking, as well as âgreen buildingâ approaches.   Zoning 
Code amendments to change the underlying zoning from C-2 (Community Business) to 
RC-3 (Residential-Commercial Combined, Medium Density), establish a Special Use 
District, and enable heights between 65-feet and 240-feet are also proposed.  
Two specific development projects would complete the buildout of the proposed 
Plan. At 5 Thomas Mellon Circle, The Yerby Company (Yerby) would demolish the 
existing office building and construct five mixed-use buildings, ranging in 
height from 68 feet to 170 feet containing a total of approximately 500 
residential units and up to 750 below-grade parking spaces.  At 150 and 250 
Executive Park Boulevard, Universal Paragon Corporation (UPC) would demolish two 
existing office buildings, and construct eight mixed-use buildings, ranging from 
65 feet up to 240 feet tall containing a total of approximately 1,100 
residential units and up to 1,677 below-grade parking spaces.

The project, which would be implemented over 20-30 years in multiple 
phases, includes the addition of approximately 5,700 net new residential units, 
the demolition and replacement of approximately 1,800 existing units which would 
remain subject to the San Francisco Rent Stabilization Ordinance, 
rent-protections and relocation rights for existing tenants, re-alignment and 
re-design of streets and blocks, re-alignment and improvement of the M Ocean 
View light rail line, the addition of new neighborhood serving retail and office 
space, new and re-configured public open spaces including neighborhood parks, 
pedestrian and bike paths, athletic fields, a new organic farm, and community 
gardens, overall transportation improvements, ecological hydrology improvements, 
and provision of renewable energy and water infrastructure. The draft 
Development Agreement would become the binding legal contract between the City 
and the Developer and would memorialize all of the public benefits and 
obligations of the Developer and associated agreements between both parties 
toward implementation of the Project.
