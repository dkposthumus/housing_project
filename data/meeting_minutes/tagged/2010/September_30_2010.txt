STANDARDS FOR BIRD-SAFE BUILDINGS
 - 
Informational hearing to announce the public release of a draft document titled "Bird-Safe Building Standards."
 This document is intended to promote bird-safe design and to reduce bird collisions into buildings.  The draft document would propose the creation of three tiers of review: 1) guidelines providing guidance to project sponsors about the potential bird hazards; 2) requirements for the most hazardous conditions; and 3) voluntary "bird-safe" certification for building owners who choose, on their own accord, to meet the guidelines. The proposal discusses potential negative impacts on resident and migratory birds, comprising suggested remedies to lessen the hazard through treatments for glazing, lighting, and other building design and operations application. 


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
Discussion and Deliberation on Potential Future Adoption

CRYSTAL SPRINGS PIPELINE NO. 2 REPLACEMENT PROJECT
 - 
Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report
 - The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) is proposing the Crystal Springs Pipeline No. 2 (CSPL2) Replacement Project. The Project proposes to upgrade and replace portions of the CSPL2, which extends (south to north) from the Crystal Springs Pump Station at the base of Lower Crystal Springs Dam in an unincorporated area of San Mateo County, through the Town of Hillsborough and the cities of San Mateo, Burlingame, Millbrae, San Bruno, South San Francisco, Brisbane, Daly City, and into the City and County of San Francisco, terminating at the University Mound Reservoir in southeastern San Francisco. The SFPUC has identified 19 sites along the 19-mile CSPL2 alignment where improvements are proposed to meet seismic reliability level-of-service goals. The improvements include pipeline rehabilitation and seismic retrofit activities at 15 sites and general improvements to protect the pipeline from corrosion and exposure at 4 sites.  In addition to these improvements, the SFPUC proposes to install new cathodic protection equipment at 9 locations and insulated flange joints (referred to as electrical isolation) at 31 locations along the CSPL2 alignment to further protect the pipeline from corrosion.


Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the Environmental Impact Report


Please note: The public hearing on the Draft EIR is closed. The public comment period for the Draft EIR ended on January 25, 2010. The Planning Commission does not conduct public review of Final EIRs. Public comments on the certification may be presented to the Planning Commission during the Public Comment portion of the Commission calendar

Commissioner Antonini:


Iâm happy to see in the press last week that the city is considering using abandoned city property as residential dwelling units for teachers and other public employees.  I think thatâs a wonderful idea.  However, I think it doesnât go far enough and I always have been an advocate for a system to help us address our middle-class residents, particularly those who are critical for the operation of San Francisco â most notably:  public safety, officials and teachers, and others whose presence is essential.  Iâd like to see a system looked at where we would perhaps have an availability bonus for these people.  And that money would have to be applied towards housing.  I think it would eliminate a lot of the problems that we sometimes have on some of our items where we try to provide affordable housing.  This would be an additional method to be able to keep particularly public safety officials in San Francisco, residing there and available for emergencies, and available for things that might happen that are not emergencies that require their presence.  It would be a situation where you wouldnât have to worry about instances like shared equity because this would be a bonus paid each year that they were here, and if for some reason where to move, that would have been their bonus for that period to time.  It would have to be use toward rent or toward purchase of a residence.  Itâs just an idea Iâm throwing out there as we grapple with the problems of keeping our middle class in San Francisco, and most notably, to those to whom we need their presence 24 hours a day often. 


Commissioner Sugaya:


From a Business Times article from September 10 â 16
th
, Oakland to Streamline Project Approvals â It says âAs part of an update to Oaklandâs General Plan, city planners drafted an environmental impact report that will address most of the areas available for residential development.â  It says âthe document should clear most of the ground work that developers typically have to do to gain approval.  Some developers may not have to do any EIRs, and some may have to do only supplemental EIRs rather than a full one.  The Oakland Planning Commission discussed it on September 15 and public comment is open until today.â  Iâd like to have some information from staff about what this is all about unless you guys already know.


Director Rahaim:


We can certainly find out more.  I think what it is about, because I saw that same article, is essentially the equivalent of a Neighborhood Plan EIR which allows subsequent projects to do what we call Community Planning.  In some cases those projects would have to do a supplemental or what is sometimes called a Focused EIR.  I think that is what they are using, but Iâll confirm that.


Commissioner Moore:


I was glad to read that the Mayor is submitting a term sheet in support of his bid for the Americas Cup.  I hope we will find a voice and on-going dialog of how to get the best out of that for citywide planning.


Commissioner Miguel:


Iâd like to mention that I met with people regarding the Booker T. Washington project; CPMC.  I was at the Planning Department roll out of the South Mission Survey Historic Area, which was quite nicely attended as far as the neighborhood was concerned.  I had the pleasure of being a guest again at the Neighborhood Network.  [I attended] the third in a very interesting presentation this week on Hope SF.  They had previously done one on the physical characteristics build out.  This was interesting because it did not concern the physical aspects that usually concern commissioners, but the support services that would have to be in place and that would work with the residents before, during, and after and are extremely extensive.  The presenter did a very good job with that one.  Also, last night the Housing Action Coalition, which gave this body its Housing Action Hero Award last year, again held their Housing Hero Awards for this year.  Commissioner Antonini and Director Rahaim were also present.  This was given to three people who were involved in the Hunterâs Point Project:  Koffy Bonner, Mike Cohen and Supervisor Maxwell with a very interesting intro by former Mayor Willie Brown.  I also want to announce that Commissioner Olague and myself were present this morning when the Board of Supervisorâs Rules Committee passed the Mayorâs recommendation, Gwyneth Borden, to continue as a member of this body.  They did so as a Committee report to be acted upon by the full Board next Tuesday.


Commissioner Sugaya:


Just a couple of other things:  Commissioner Olague, myself and Commissioner Martinez from the Historic Preservation Commission attended a meeting with staff on the subject of Social Cultural Heritage Preservation in the City.  We were presented with ideas from the Planning Department associated with planning going on in Western SOMA with respect to the Pilipino community in that area, and also the LGBTQ community.  They had some very interesting documents for us to review.  I think the purpose of the meeting was to involve as much as possible staff from OEWD.  I think the meeting as an initial kick off went very well.  There will be some follow up, especially with people.  Claudia from staff who is involved with some similar things in the Mission and Paul Lord who was working with Western SOMA and is now working with Japantown, so I now think the scope will expand a bit and include those communities as well.


I also attended the Saturday meeting of the South Mission Survey.  I think the attendance was a bit lower there because there was some concern from the community about not having gotten the work out enough.  It was recommended to staff to continue community outreach through the community organizations in that area.  Instead of the Planning Department sponsoring the workshop, it was recommended that the Department go through some of the existing organizations.  Hopefully they will follow up on that.


Commissioner Antonini:


Since we last met, I have also met with both neighborhood groups and representatives of Cal Pacific Medical Center; neighborhood groups with concerns about Booker T. Washington project as well as some of the sponsors of the project; and President Miguel mention the Housing Heroâs Awards last night.

11.        Discussion with possible action on when to calendar Park Merced


 


SPEAKERS:     Mitchell, Ted, Jim Abrams â representing Park Merced, Sue Hestor, and Calvin Welch


ACTION:           Director Rahaim proposed that the schedule would be to initiate on October 21, followed by a hearing on November 18.  However, because the item has been advertised in the newspaper for entitlements on October 21, he noted that the hearing would have to show on that calendar as an item Proposed for Continuance to November 18.  Other than discussion, the Commission did not take any action.

12.        Directorâs Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


The only announcement I want to make is regarding the South Mission Survey hearings.  I want to thank Commissioners Miguel and Sugaya for attending those meetings, as well as Historic Preservation Commissioner Alan Martinez who actually attended both of the public meetings on that survey.  We will be looking on some continuing outreach with the neighborhood groups as was suggested by Commissioners Sugaya and Martinez.


We are working on a date for the upcoming survey on the South of Market area as well.  I think that is in early November.  We will let you know in a week or so when that will be.


I just want to mention that I will be leaving the meeting around 6 p.m. tonight to attend a meeting regarding SB375 that is with elected officials and several Department Heads.  I thought it was important that I attend that meeting this evening.

13.        Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.


 


BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:


 


Land Use Committee:  


        
The Committee heard an 
ordinance that would create an SUD for the LGBT Center at 1800 Market Street
.  This ordinance was considered by this Commission on July 22 and by the HPC on July 21.  Both Commissions recommended approval with a non-substantive modification that the control be cross-referenced in Section 702.2 of the Planning Code.  
This week the Land Use Committee modified the legislation to include your recommendation.


        
Ordinance relating in part to TDR in general and in part to a specific parcel at 680 California Street (aka Old St. Maryâs Church).  
This ordinance would amend 1) the General Plan; 2) Zoning Map; and 3) Section 128 of the Code.  The property would be rezoned to allow the sale of TDRs.  The HPC considered the ordinance on June 2
nd
 and recommended approval.  This Commission considered the ordinance on June 20
th
 and recommended approval.  
This Monday, the Land Use Committee passed out the original legislation as you heard it.  This enabled the Boardâs vote (10-0) on Tuesday of this week to approve the rezoning.  Next Monday, the Land Use Committee will hear again a revised version of the ordinance that adds more specificity on restrictions to the TDR funds in response to concerns raised by SPUR and others.  This revised version of the ordinance will supersede the ordinance passed this week by the Board.


        
CEQA Reform â 
The Land Use Committee also considered an ordinance to add regulations to the Administrative Code so as to specify procedures for appeals of neg decs and exemptions.  The proposed ordinance was considered by this Commission on 6/24/10.  At that time you recommended 11 modifications.  The HPC considered the legislation on 6/16 and 7/7 at which point they concurred with your recommendations and added 4 additional considerations.  Supervisor Alioto-Pier responded to and incorporated the vast majority of your recommendations.  Some of your recommendations that sought to add clarity to how one could preserve appeal rights were no longer applicable as the sponsor has removed proposed requirements to retain appeal rights.  Many of the speakers at the Committee hearing were still under the mistaken belief that the ordinance would require action to maintain appeal rights, but this is no longer true to the revised ordinance.  Other requests from the Planning Commission that sought to increase the ability for all parties to reasonably participate in the process have been incorporated.  Examples of these amendments now in the ordinance include:  setting reasonable timelines for appeal hearings so all parties have time to prepare while allowing for additional time when the Board may be on recess; providing for staggered deadlines for submittal of material to the Board, and clarifying when notice is required for exemptions, especially those issued by other departments.  Other recommendations of the Commission incorporated into this version of the legislation would clarify currently ambiguous procedures such as:  clarifying what may be subject to subsequent appeals after the Board remands a CEQA determination and sends it back to the Department for more work.  Lastly, some technical recommendations have also been incorporated.  The Legislative Sponsor responded to the HPC requests by eliminating prior participation for an appeal, expanding notice of exemptions, including the HPC in the review process, and ensuring the designation of historic districts is not interrupted by CEQA appeals.  Due to the number of speakers in opposition and the misunderstandings of the content of the current proposal, the item has been continued to on or after 10/25 so that the Supervisor may continue to conduct outreach.


Full Board of Supervisors:


        
ADA Ramp
 â The Board considered the HPCâs Certificate of Appropriateness to changes to the Board Chambers that would allow ADA access to the Board Presidentâs dais and the Clerkâs table.  
This week the Board approved the C  of A with a 9-1 vote.


        
Construction Agreement for 1150 Ocean Avenue â 
This would authorize the Director of Planning to execute the agreement on behalf of the City to ensure the construction of 26 inclusionary units on site.


        
The Board considered a resolution supporting existing area plan housing requirements.
  Last week our director testified at the Land use Committee on this item.  At that time he reported that we were still waiting for CPMC to submit plans enabling us to calculate the amount of housing that the Van Ness Area Plan would require.  He also noted that the same plan does provide an avenue for a code complying project to avoid the requirement if approved by a CU by this Commission.  This CU authorization is the current proposal for the project.
  The full Board voted to approve this resolution 7-3.


Rules Committee:


        
Earlier today, the Rules Committee recommended reappointment of Gwyneth Borden to the Planning Commission.  
This recommendation will be considered by the Full Board next Tuesday.  If confirmed by the Full Board, she may be able to join you in time for next weekâs hearing.


Introductions:


        
Supervisor Maxwell 
introduced an ordinance amending Planning Code Sections 420.1 through 420.5 to update the Visitacion Valley Community Facilities and Infrastructure Fee and Fund and to conform the program with other Area Plan.


 


BOARD OF APPEALS


        
No report


 


HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION


        
The HPC held a special meeting yesterday to discuss Articles 10 & 11.  
Staff will bring their recommended suggestions for changes back before them next week.  Those recommended changes will also be before you in a joint hearing with the HPC on October 21.


 


E.         GENERAL
PUBLIC COMMENT â 15 MINUTES


 


At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
