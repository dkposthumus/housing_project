Commissioner Moore
:


On Drum Street at the Embarcadero, there is a tent structure in what I think is a seawall lot displaying a tent for the use of something of what I think is Peter Pan.  What Iâm asking is whether or not yourself, planning staff, or anybody else has had input into this.  It is a three dimensional structure and Iâm very concerned about the look of the structure as it presents itself to the outside world.  There is a completely substandard fence; activities along the fence, which are causing a blighting affect walking by and I am very unhappy.  And I hear that this thing might be there till December.   It was announced originally as a temporary use which I thought would be a week or two or three.  Now I hear it will be there until December and I donât believe that proper exterior attention has been given to how this thing looks from the streetscape point of view.  I want to bring that to your attention (Director Rahaim) and ask your advice on it.


Director Rahaim:


Commissioner, as you know that is a city park.  As a park, the Department does not have entitlement review.  But I will look into the details more specifically and get back to you.


Commissioner Moore:


I observed a blighting affect on streetscape including what I think is a wrong use of the back side of the facility.  I believe that Planning, being the steward of our public right-of-way, should have a say on that. 


Commissioner Antonini
:


I just want to mention that I did have a meeting with some of the DR requestors on a project at 60 Normandie and I believe that I am also scheduled to meet with the project sponsor.  On one other subject:  As most of you know when we take a significant action we have to have four votes to take anything other than a procedural action.  So it is somewhat disturbing when you see low turnouts of voting on significant issues.  I donât know what we would ever do on election codes to change that type of thing.  Obviously, sometimes weâd have protections on tax measures and on significant expenditures of public funds.  It is one of the weakness sometimes and Tuesday the voter turnout was quite low throughout the state and it is disturbing to see that kind of thing happen.


Commissioner Olague
:


This may come up during Secretary Averyâs report on the HPC, but I am going to request that â¦;  I know that some conversations have been had there regarding Articles 10 & 11.  I was going to ask that we get some briefing on what those conversations are during the Directorâs Report in the future so that we can maybe discuss it.  I donât know if it might be a good thing if at some point â I know that the Board has one piece of legislation.  I think there are about four different versions of Articles 10 & 11 floating around.  At some point I think it would be advisable to have a joint hearing again the HPC when it gets closer to the Board calendaring it so that there can be a more productive discussion with stake holders invited and also members of the public allowed to weigh in.  Iâm hoping there can be some kind of possibility to review whatâs in front of us an compare it to some of the other things that are being discussed out there and have an open public discussion. 


Commissioner Miguel
:


Iâd like to mention that Iâve had in the last couple of weeks a number of meetings with people on various sides of the Fairmont, Lombard Street, San Marcos, CPMC, the Columbarium, Ord Street, Normandie, UCSF, and last night an excellent session was held on the rebuilt Potrero for the Potrero Housing â a series of meetings they have been having with the public with excellent representation from the residents and from the neighborhood working on various parts of that project.  Last night it was the parks and some of the streetscape.  They have been doing it section by section.  In my opinion they have been doing an excellent job of outreach on a very major project.


Commissioner Sugaya
:


In the paper about two or three weeks ago there was photograph of the Pavement-to-Parks.  It was an interesting photo because there was a couple eating and obviously enjoying themselves.  But in the foreground of the photo there was a parking meter.  So I was wondering if MTA is going to start enforcing their parking rules against people who are camped out at these places.  They should plug the meter right?  [Laughter in the background]

4.         Directorâs Announcements


            


Director Rahaim
:


Last night we held a public workshop in Fishermanâs Wharf on the design of Jefferson Street.  There was a positive meeting with strong support for that design.  We are moving ahead with environmental review on that design as well with some funding from local merchants as well as the Port.  That project should hopefully be able to proceed in the coming months.  With respect to Articles 10 & 11 â it was on my list to talk to you about it â the Historic Preservation Commission had a discussion about this when I was there last month as well as other interested parties.  My thought at this point is that I believe that there are steps that we can take as a Department to move forward with some elements of Articles 10 & 11.  So I was going to prepare in the next couple of weeks a memo for both commissions outlining my suggested approach for how to proceed.  It might involve a hearing somewhat later in the process because I think there are some smaller steps we can take before then as well as an idea I presented to the Historic Preservation Commission, which is to have a kind of workshop on preservation issues.  I think itâs time we got a group of interested parties and commissioners around the table, perhaps for a day-long session on this.  Iâm suggesting that we do that in the fall.  It will take some funding to facilitate this, but I think itâs time we do this.  I think there are some interesting discussions that are happening and for lack of a better term Iâm calling it a Preservation Summit that we would have in the fall.  It would involve members of the public, the Commissions, staff and other experts. The last thing I want to do is introduce our three summer interns that in the audience today.  First is Loretta Ann Subaruski who is a Masters student in Historic Preservation at the University of Southern California.  She is also working on a certificate in Building Sciences.  She is originally from Los Angeles, but has spent some time in San Francisco as well.  She will be working with the Preservation staff on a number of issues.  Next we have Alexandra Sweet who is getting a Masters degree in City Planning from the University of Pennsylvania.  She will be working with the City Design Public Realm project in North Beach working with the Urban Design Public Realm team.  And we have Christopher Loaman who is from Palo Alto, graduating from Stanford â actually this Sunday as I understand.  He was a double major in History and Archeology.  He is working for Randall Dean, our staff archeologist researching Chinese immigrant archeology in San Francisco.  Iâm very pleased to have them and I look forward to working with them all summer.

5.         Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.


 


Board of Supervisors:


 


Land Use
: 


100648:  Resolution authorizing the Planning Department to accept and expend a grant from Caltrans for a Community Design Process for Cesar Chavez Street in the amount of $250,000.  
This was
 
forwarded and approved by the full Board on Tuesday


Full Board
:


Double Density Bonus â 
An ordinance would amend the Planning Code to provide double density bonus if projects include senior housing or housing for people with physical disabilities.  The Land Use Committee made one amendment for on-site affordable housing provisions to the pending section 315 legislation for the inclusionary affordable housing. 
As amended, the Board passed this on its first reading
.


Prohibition on Sitting or Lying on Public Sidewalks â
 This commission heard this in April of this year and did not recommend approval or disapproval.  Instead you recommended that the city maintain streets and sidewalks as a vital component of the cityâs open space system; and further urged that the Board take extra consideration for those who live in SRO Hotels or areas where the Planning Code requires less open space; and as well for day laborers who may sit on the sidewalks while looking for employment.  
This week the Board disapproved the ordinance on a 3 to 8 vote
.


New Legislation
:


100755
 â A resolution introduced by four Supervisors that would support our existing Area Plan Housing policies.


100765 
â A resolution introduced by Supervisor Mirkarimi that would support the enforcement of the preservation and restoration of Sacred Heart Church.


 


Board of Appeals
:


 


2462 27
th
 Avenue
 â The project application was for a one story vertical addition with an 11 foot set back and rear horizontal expansion filled in 2005.  A DR request was submitted in January 2006.  The Commission heard it in October 2006 and did not take DR.  The permit was issued in 2007 and appealed to the Board of Appeals.  A CEQA appeal was filed prior to the Board of Appeals hearing and the Board of Supervisors overturned the CatEx determination and required additional review, including an HRER.  A revised CatEx was issued in November 2009 and the case was rescheduled at the Board of Appeals.  A second appeal was filed on the CatEx prior to the Board of Appeals hearing and the Board of Supervisors upheld the CatEx in May 2010.  The Board of Appeals voted unanimously 4-0 (Vice President Goh was absent) to uphold the building permit application.


350 Divisadero Street
 â An appeal of a Letter of Determination which stated that MCD use previously operated as San Francisco Patientâs Cooperative, could not be âRESTOREDâ by a new operator at the subject property.  
The Board of Appeals voted 3-1 (Commissioner Hwang opposed and Vice President Goh absent) to uphold the Letter of Determination.

Car-share requirements and guidelines
 -
  
The Commission will review a draft Zoning Administrator Bulletin; consider adoption of a proposed Commission policy statement on car-share; and consider Initiation of Amendments to the Planning Code. 
 The Commission will also hear a summary of existing car-share controls.   The draft Zoning Administrator Bulletin would establish protocols for the Departmentâs administration of car-sharing requirements, distinguish between different types of car-share spaces, and provide guidelines for the physical configuration of car-share spaces. The Commission will also consider adopting policies on car-share and development through the proposed Planning Commission Policy Resolution. The draft Commission resolution, if adopted, would establish city policy concerning new developments and car-share, specifically it would establish guidelines for the displacement of car-share spaces by new development, offer guidance to the public on situations where the Commission may establish requirements that are beyond those identified in Section 166 and announce the Commissionâs interest in exploring a citywide system for on-street car-share parking network. Pursuant to Planning Code Section 302, the Planning Commission will consider a Resolution of Intention to initiate amendments to the Planning Code that would establish new controls for car-share in Section 166. 
Note
: the Commission will not make recommendations on the draft Ordinance at this hearing.  Instead, the Commission may set a future hearing date to consider the draft Ordinance.  For more information, please visit:  http://www.sf-planning.org/index.aspx?page=2347


                        Preliminary Recommendation: Approval of draft Commission Resolution to                                      establish a Commission Policy on car-share and to initiate amendments to the                                                Planning Code at a later hearing.

950 Mason Street
 â Fairmont Hotel Project
 - 
D
raft Environmental Impact Report
 - The project site is located at 950 Mason Street (Assessorâs Block 0244, Lot 001). The proposed project includes: 1) renovation of portions of the landmark 1906 Fairmont Hotel building (City Landmark # 185), including consolidation of up to 60 hotel rooms; 2) reconfiguration of some existing hotel uses; 3) demolition of the 1961 23-story Fairmont Hotel tower above the five-story podium; and 4) construction of a new 160âunit, 26-story residential tower and five-story midrise residential component, both above a five-story podium, on the site of the existing hotel tower and podium (proposed to be demolished). The proposed project would include below-grade parking for about 350 vehicles.  The 113,400-square-foot project site is located in an RM-4 (Residential Mixed-High Density) Use District and the Nob Hill Special Use District (SUD), and in 200-E, 300-E and 320-E Height and Bulk Districts.  The proposed project would require Conditional Use (CU) authorization for height and bulk and for a Planned Unit Development (PUD) including exceptions to the 25 percent rear yard requirement, as well as require Planning Commission approval under the âLarge Tourist Hotel Conversion Ordinance,â Administrative Code 41F.3(f), among other approvals. The proposed exterior changes to the historic 1906 Fairmont Hotel building would also require a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Historic Preservation Commission. The Draft EIR found that implementation of the proposed project would result in a significant unavoidable environmental impact on cultural resources, related to demolition of the Tonga Room, which has been identified as a historic resource under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
