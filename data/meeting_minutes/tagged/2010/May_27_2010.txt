Commissioner Antonini
:


-
  
I got a couple of things. Actually, I just finished reading a very interesting book which is fiction, and the name of the book is "Treasure Hunt" and the author, John Less, sometimes good fiction mirrors reality and this particular book might have answers to some of the problems
we have with process and other things in San Francisco perhaps, but in any case, it deals with a huge network of organizations.  It's set in San Francisco, very interesting. You will recognize all the places they go to, who get hundreds of millions of funding annually and it's a murder mystery and one of the main leaders of one of these groups is the victim. So quite interesting On another subject, and I am not speaking about a particular case, there was one last week, and I would like to inquire as to what qualifies on to be the project sponsor, or who has to be named as a project sponsor on a particular space.  If, for example, one person is the signatory to the project itself and writes the check fort he project, one would assume that would qualify he or she as project sponsor, for our identification, it makes it easier when we are trying to
look for any possible situations that might require us to, you know, do further research on this, as far as connections we May have, to have all the project sponsors listed, you know, or if you write the check, aren't you a sponsor, that's the question I bring up to staff just to see if we could have standardization on that in the future.


 


Commissioner Sugaya
:


-
  
One question. It doesn't have to be answered here, on 555 Washington, there were some reports here and that there is some money owed to the Department, if the Director could just give us a memo, actually, I will be happy to.


-  Secondly on the Mid-Market EIR there should be consideration given to extending the comment period on the draft environmental report from 45 days to 60 days. i don't know how that's properly done or not done, but â >> I think it's the call of the Environmental Review Officer
with  the Commission's suggestion.   I have sent him an e-mail, so -- >> I would second that.    


Commissioner Antonini
:  


-  On that one, I would have to study that. It seems adequate but I haven't had a chance to look at it. So, you know, I guess if it exceeds or meets the requirements, I would think it should be
adequate.


President Miguel
:


-
  
Because of the extent of the project and neighborhood involvement -- 45 to 60 is not extensive we are talking about a 15-day extension, that would probably be reasonable.

11.        Directorâs Announcements


           


Director Rahaim:


-
  
I think the continuances today were to offer you a shorter meeting to make up for last week.  The only thing I wanted to report on today was the position of acting zoning administrator, I wanted to let you know that I have asked Scott Sanchez of the Department to be Acting Zoning Administrator for the time being, however, because Scott is on a long-planned vacation this week and next week, Kelly Amdur will be filling in for him this week and next, then Scott will take over. And about that same time, I will be posting for the position of Zoning Administrator. I am working on the job description right now. So when that is prepared, I will certainly pass that onto you, the staff and the public as well.

12.        Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.


 


board of supervisors:


-
  
Activities for Planning and Land Use: They heard the double density bonus for senior housing,
introduced by Board President Chiu, would amend the code to provide a density bonus for 
seniors or housing for peoples with physical disabilities. It would update the requirements and require a conditional use authorization for getting this density bonus. This Commission heard this October of 2009, and you recommended approval. There was one amendment at the Land Use Committee, linking the portable housing provisions to the inclusionary housing requirements, as amended this week the committee forwards the full ordinance to the full Board, and at the full board I wanted to share with you the major action there concerning planning was adopting of the findings for 424 San Francisco Street you will recall it was the
addition of six off-street parking places, and at the May 11th hearing appellants raised issues including lack of a comprehensive traffic study, inadequate noticing and potential impact on historic resources and transportation, after testimony, it was overturned and sent back to the department. This week, I wanted to review the findings with you. First finding would require that 
further project approvals for these garages would have an EIR 
for all proposed garage installation and this would pertain to the whole area in the sud and
commercial areas a-rod broadway, china town and the sud. The board states concerns about
cumulative impacts and we must study traffic and neighborhood character and historic resources.
Secondly the board also interpreted administrative kid provisions for noticing slightly different than how we have been doing it. Their interpretation means all categories call exemptions
issued by the department must be noticed in Administrative Code 31. In the past we interpreted this to require notice when projects required a written determination. And going forward the Board findings May require tracking of all the projects in 31. So at this week's hearing, Supervisor Dufty made a motion to limit the impacts, including not requiring any EIR for new garages. The department is working to develop procedures and we will keep you posted and lastly there was a new piece of planning legislation introduced by supervisor. Introducing a zoning amend at Presidio Avenue and also change the height from 40-x to 50-x. That will be before you in the future.

At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes. 


 


The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public comment, the commission is limited to: 


 


(1)  responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or


(2)  requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or 


(3)
