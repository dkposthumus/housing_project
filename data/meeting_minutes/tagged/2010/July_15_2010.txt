.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission. 


 


Commissioner Antonini:


- I had occasion to be in East bay to pick up some goods that were being donated to a charitable event that I was working on. this happened to be from a beverage distributor, I went to this industrial park.
I was thinking it is located in Union City. It was a wonderful place as far as little lawns. It was well lit. There were trees. We do not really have anything like that. We have some space for those types of things could occur. The closest we have is on Third and Evans Streets, where we have something that has been built in the last 20 or 30 years. this distributor for the Bay Area, many distributors distribute perishable items I hope we are looking at these situations. We have talked about out reached to see where we could talk to distributors and various light manufacturers, because it costs a lot of money and time when you have trucks on highways burning up gas, whereas if you had a distribution point in the west bay, preferably in sentences go, it makes economic sense. I just pass that on for consideration for those who are working on these sorts of issues. It is a frequent thing. We have discussed jobs. There were plenty of them there. This could be something that would be very appropriate in the areas where we have core PDR in San Francisco. 


Commissioner Sugaya
:


-  I knew I was going to forget the name of the market. I had reason to go near 
Columbus or -- was on Green? There was -- conditional use a while back for a grocery store. 
The staff has investigated it with respect to its present configuration, which looks to be mainly like a wine bar and a wine store. I believe there were taking some action. But perhaps we could get a report back at some point.


President Miguel
:  


-
   
During the past week, I have been in discussion with some of their representatives for CVS, the drug chain, and with Target, regarding locations in San Francisco. 


-
         
 


Commissioner antonini
:


- That tweaked my memory. I have also been in discussion with representatives that happen working with Cal Pacific, which will be coming forward for a project within the next month or two. 


 


Commissioner Sugaya
:   


-
   
As I walked down, I see an increasing number of vacancies downtown. For example, there was a small gallery district on Sutter, around Mason and that area. There were six or more vacancies. What I am concerned is that the owners of those buildings do not properly take care of the building when the storefront is empty. There is a tendency of graffiti. There is a tendency of litter. There is a tendency of homeless people, not only at night but also during the day, occupying the storefronts. And I am not particularly targeting the homeless people, but I talk about particular attention to an un-leased property, which I do think the owners of buildings should be obligated to. I think it is in the interest of the city at large that we put forward the word that that is necessary, and I am not sure what tools we have, as to whether  or not this might be a discussion were having with other departments. But I do think we need to help ourselves. The tourists are in those areas. We ourselves have residents walk around.


Commissioner Moore:


- I think it is a combination of our Department and Public Works. I will talk to the staff. 


 


Vice-President Olague
:


-  I just wanted to point out an article I read. I am not related to anyone at 7 by 7, selling magazines or anything. But there is an interesting magazine on the neighborhood and the transformation from the neighborhood. I think there are some interesting pieces in the Mission District, and some of the other locally owned businesses, more independently owned retailers. I think what is interesting about this article is it does give some sort of -- sheds some light on some of the struggles that we have as commissioners when it comes to the issue of formula retail and the impact it might have on some of the existing neighborhoods.
- I would encourage people, if you are out and about, to look through it, read through some of it.  It does help, I think, gives some insight into some of the struggles we have here, when it comes to that issue, and the desire we want to preserve neighborhood character and history of the neighborhood. Check it out. It is interesting.

BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:


Land Use Committee
: 


§
        
Informational Hearing Only on 12 Ordinances for Bayview Hunters Point Shipyard/Candlestick.
  This project would create 10,500 new units, 3.7 million square feet of commercial and retail space, a performing arts theater, an artistsâ colony, and possibly a new waterfront stadium for the San Francisco 49ers. The Land Use Committee heard presentations from the Mayorâs Office, the Redevelopment agency and Planning Department staff. This hearing was part of a series of informational hearings that the Land Use Committee has heard on the project. This weekâs hearing focused on the 12 draft Ordinances that will be before them for action.  You heard the draft Ordinances under your purview at the June 3
rd
 joint hearing with the Redevelopment Agency Commission.  While your hearing lasted 13 hours, this weekâs hearing at the LU Committee was only 3 hours long. All of the Ordinances were released from the 30-day hold this week and were available for Committee action.  
At this week's hearing,  President Chiu introduced five amendments to the various actions that address (1) the Yosemite Slough Bridge, (2) acceptance of HPS Parcel E-2 from the Navy, (3) expansion of the SE Health Center,  (4) additional workforce development provision for "at risk" job applicants, and (5) updating PUC studies regarding public power.  Amendments that could be adopted were adopted.  The actions themselves were passed out of committee without decisions.  Final actions on the items are scheduled for the full Board on July 27.  


 


FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:


 


§
        
Hearing on Proposed Amendments to the Bayview Hunters Point and Hunters Point Shipyard Redevelopment Plans - 
This week the Full Board held the first hearing on the Redevelopment Plan.  This item was scheduled for potential action.  
This week the Board closed the public hearing and continued final action until July 27, 2010. 


 


§
        
Appeal of Certification of Final Environmental Impact Report - Candlestick Point - Hunters Point Shipyard Phase II Development Plan.  
The Commission certified the EIR on June 3, 2010 by a 4-3 vote.  This weekâs hearing lasted about 11 hours.  Appellants focused their concerns on the completeness of the clean-up of the superfund site and the creation of a bridge through wetlands. Proponents noted the job creation and revitalization that the project would bring.  
The vote was 8-3 to uphold the EIR. (Avalos, Daly, Mar)


 


BOARD OF APPEALS:


2642-2644 Hyde Street
:
 Appeal of building permit to legalize an existing deck at the rear of the property.  Appellant stated concerns over light/air/privacy.  The Commission heard a DR on this permit on September 24, 2009.  You voted unanimously to approve the permit.  The Board of Appeals agreed and also voted unanimously to approve the permit.


 


763 University Avenue
:
 Appeal of a Notice of Violation that was issued to enforce Conditions applied by this Commission on a DR for the subject property.  You heard the DR in January 2009. At that time, the subject permit was filed to legalize work that was done beyond the scope of a previously issued permit.  While the Appellant initially submitted plans that complied with the Commission's decision, they later submitted revisions to the permit after the Planning Department had approved the plans.  When the non-conforming revision was routed back to Planning, staff instructed the Appellant to comply with the Commission's decision.  Despite this instruction, they refused to comply. As a result, the Department began enforcement proceedings and issued the Notice of Violation.  The Board of Appeals agreed that the Appellant had not complied with the Commission's decision and unanimously upheld the Notice of Violation and Penalty.  The decision can be credited in part to the persistent efforts of Kate Conner (Code Enforcement) and Ben Fu (Neighborhood Planning - SE), who attending the appeal hearing.


 


708 Vermont Street
:
 Appeal of a building permit to add a floor to an existing building.  The Appellant was concerned over light and air regarding to a small lightwell on their property.  They argued that the matching lightwell provided by the Project Sponsor was not adequate and requested a larger lightwell.  You heard a DR on this permit on January 14, 2010.  At that time you voted to uphold the permit
[1]
.  The Board was of similar opinion and voted to uphold the building permit

San Francisco Enterprise Zone
 - 
Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report
 - The Enterprise Zone (EZ) is a long-term (15-year) partnership with local governments and private companies to generate new private sector investment and growth. The State provides performance based tax incentives to EZ businesses to revitalize chronically deteriorated areas; hire the most difficult-to-hire residents in private sector jobs; and retain, expand, and reward businesses that participate. The proposed project consists of renewing and reestablishing San Franciscoâs EZ and modifying the geographic boundaries of the previous EZ (established on May 28, 1992). The EZ previously consisted of approximately 4,902 acres and included most of the Cityâs commercial- and industrial-designated areas. The new EZ would consist of approximately 5,815 acres or approximately 913 acres more than the previous EZ. 


Please note: The public hearing on the Draft EIR is closed. The public comment period for the Draft EIR ended on February 8, 2010. The Planning Commission does not conduct public review of Final EIRs. Public comments on the certification may be presented to the Planning Commission during the Public Comment portion of the Commission calendar.
