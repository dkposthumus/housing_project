Public Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Report
 - 
The Enterprise Zone (EZ) is a long-term (15-year) partnership with local governments and private companies to generate new private sector investment and growth. The State provides performance based tax incentives to EZ businesses to revitalize chronically deteriorated areas; hire the most difficult-to-hire residents in private sector jobs; and retain, expand, and reward businesses that participate. The proposed project consists of renewing and reestablishing San Franciscoâs EZ and modifying the geographic boundaries of the previous EZ (established on May 28, 1992). The EZ previously consisted of approximately 4,902 acres and included most of the Cityâs commercial- and industrial-designated areas. The new EZ would consist of approximately 5,815 acres or approximately 913 acres more than the previous EZ
