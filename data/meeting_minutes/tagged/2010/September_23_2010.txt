PUBLIC Hearing on the California Pacific Medical Center 
(CPMC) 
Long Range Development Plan
 (LRDP) Draft EIR
 â 
The proposed project is CPMCâs multi-phased plan to meet State seismic safety requirements for hospitals, expand medical facilities, and create a 20-year framework and Institutional Master Plan for its four existing medical campuses (Pacific Campus at Sacramento and Buchanan Streets, California Campus at Maple and California Streets, Davies Campus at Castro and 14th Streets, and St. Lukeâs Campus at Cesar Chavez and Valencia Streets), and a new medical campus (Cathedral Hill Campus at Van Ness Avenue and Geary Boulevard) in San Francisco. The proposed Cathedral Hill Campus would include development of a 15-story, 555-bed hospital and two medical office buildings (MOBs), Cathedral Hill MOB and 1375 Sutter MOB. An underground pedestrian tunnel is proposed beneath Van Ness Avenue connecting the Cathedral Hill MOB and new hospital. When completed (2015), the Cathedral Hill Campus would allow CPMC to consolidate existing acute-care and primary emergency services, and Womenâs and Childrenâs Center at existing campuses within the new Cathedral Hill Hospital, as well as to redevelop its existing campuses. Pacific Campus development would include a new Ambulatory Care Center and underground parking. Davies Campus development would include two new MOBs and parking improvements. St. Lukeâs Campus development would include a new six-story, 80-bed replacement hospital and a five-story MOB/Expansion Building (and parking improvements) on the site of the former (demolished) hospital. CPMC would sell the California Campus by 2020 after relocation of its inpatient services to the new Cathedral Hill Hospital and other services to the Pacific Campus. 


The proposed new Cathedral Hill Hospital Campus is within the RC-4 (Residential Commercial-High Density) Use District, NC-3 (Neighborhood Commercial, Moderate-Scale) Use District, and Van Ness Special Use District (SUD); and 130-V and 130-E Height and Bulk Districts.  The Pacific Campus is within the RM-1 and RM-2 (Low Density Residential, Mixed and Moderate Density Residential, Mixed, respectively) Use Districts; and 40-X and 160-F Height and Bulk Districts. The California Campus is within the RM-2 Use District; and the 80-E Height and Bulk District. The Davies Campus is within the RH-3 (Residential House, Three-Family) Use District; and the 65-D Height and Bulk District. The St. Lukeâs Campus is within the RH-2 (Residential House, Two-Family) Use District; and 65-D and 105-E Height and Bulk Districts. The CPMC LRDP would require General Plan and Planning Code text and map amendments; General Plan referrals; Planned Unit Development (PUD) and Conditional Use authorization (CU) addressing height, bulk, parking and permitted uses, among other approvals.


            
Preliminary Recommendation
: No action is required. This hearing is for the purpose of receiving Planning Commission and public comment only.
