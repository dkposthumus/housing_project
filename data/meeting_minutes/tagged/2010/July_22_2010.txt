southwest corner of Second and Howard Streets (Assessorâs Block 3735, Lots 05, 
63)  
Certification of a Final Environmental Impact Report
. The proposed 
project would involve removal of an existing surface parking lot and 
construction of a 26-story, approximately 350-foot-tall office tower containing 
about 430,650 square feet of office space in San Franciscoâs southern Financial 
District. The project would have about 4,800 square feet of retail space and 
approximately 8,750 square feet of enclosed publicly accessible "indoor park" on 
the ground floor. The proposed project would also provide 54 parking spaces on 
two basement levels; about 46 bicycle parking spaces; and two off-street truck 
loading spaces plus three additional service van spaces in the basement. The 
proposed project includes acquisition of a portion of adjacent Lot 5 and 
demolition of an existing loading dock at the 




631 
Howard Street (William Volker) building. The project site is within the C 3-O 
(SD) Downtown Office (Special Development) District. Most of the site is within 
the 350-S height and bulk district, while the northwest corner of the site is 
within a 150-S height and bulk district. The project sponsor is seeking an 
amendment of the height and bulk map (rezoning) and a General Plan map amendment 
to increase the height and bulk limit to 350-S on the entire site. 
Please 
note: The public review period for the Draft Environmental Impact Report is 
closed. The Planning Commission does not conduct public review of Final EIRs. 
Public comments on the certification may be presented to the Planning Commission 
during the Public Comment portion of the Commission calendar.





Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the Final Environmental Impact Report.

filing fee, and make other adjustments for cost recovery.

recovery, change the timing of Environmental Impact Report payments; add a new 
fee for mitigation and condition of approval monitoring; and clarify phase

first reading with your amendments.

On introductions this week, Supervisor Campos introduced a resolution that 
requests the Planning Commission or Planning Department extend the public 
comment period on the California Pacific Medical Centerâs Draft EIR to a minimum
