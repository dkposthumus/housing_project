HARRY TRACY WATER TREATMENT PLANT (HTWTP) LONG-TERM IMPROVEMENTS PROJECT
 - 
Public Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Report -
 The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) is proposing  TC "San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC)" \f A \l "1" to implement the Harry Tracy Water Treatment Plant (HTWTP) TC "Harry Tracy Water Treatment Plant (HTWTP)" \f A \l "1"  Long-Term Improvements Project to meet WSIP levels of service for water quality and delivery reliability, seismic reliability, and other improvements necessary to the enhance the operation of the HTWTP. The treatment process would generally be the same even with the proposed improvements. The primary differences would be to solids handling, whereby solids from the sludge holding tank would be transferred to a solids dewatering facility before being trucked off site, and to the treated water storage, which would occur in a single new tank north of the main plant site instead of two tanks southeast of the main plant. The HTWTP is located on 52.3 acres in an unincorporated area of San Mateo County just east of Interstate 280 (I-280) TC "Interstate 280 (I-280)" \f A \l "1"  near the City of San Bruno and the City of Millbrae. A small portion of the site is within the City of Millbrae.


Preliminary Recommendation: No Action Required


Note: Written comments will be accepted at the Planning Departmentâs offices until the close of business on Monday, May 17, 2010.

I also had some things to bring up that is more geared toward staff issues, but out of courtesy to the Director, who is not here, I will bring them up next week.


Commissioner Moore:


I also had a couple of questions for the Director regarding staff, but with him not being here, I think it is not the correct thing to do.

Board of Supervisors Hearings this week
:


Public Safety Committee:


        
Sit/Lie Ordinance
 â this Commission did not recommend approval or disapproval but instead recommended that the City maintain the streets and sidewalks as a vital component of the Cityâs open space system.  You further urged that extra consideration be given for 1) those who live in Single Room Occupancy Hotels or areas where the Planning Code requires less private open space per unit and 2) day laborers who may sit on the sidewalk while waiting for employment.  After 5 ½ hours of testimony and discussion, the item was continued to May 24.


Land Use Committee:


        
150 Otis Street
 was heard â
 they voted to recommend approval to the full Board


        
Double Density bonus â 
This Commission heard thin in October of 2009 and recommended approval.  The Committee approved the amendment and continued it for two weeks.


Full Board of Supervisors:


        
There was action on 2 of the 3 ordinances that comprise the Development Stimulus/Fee Reform and Deferral package â 
The Housing Transfer Fee ordinance was continued to the call of the chair; and the other two ordinances were approved on first reading this week with all 12 of your recommendations being incorporated into the legislation.


        
CEQA Appeal of 424 Francisco Street â 
there was an appeal of the Cat Ex.  The Board voted to overturn the Cat Ex and sent it back to the department for an EIR.  The Board:

1.
      
made findings that the Department must require an EIR for all proposed garage installations in the newly-enacted Chiu/Garage legislation (NB, NCD, Broadway NCD, C-town, new SUD) that must study traffic impacts, historic resources, impacts to land use, and impacts to affordable housing; and
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
2.
      
they interpreted the Administrative Code provisions for noticing to mean that all categorical exemptions issued by the Department must be noticed.  In the past the Department had interpreted the Administrative Code as requiring notice for certain projects where a âwritten determinationâ was provided such as where a historic resource is present or a demolition is involved.


        
On May 4
th
 there was also a CU and CEQA appeal on the Masonic Center at 1111 California Street â 
after a lengthy hearing, the Board did vote to uphold the Cat Ex and to modify the CU by adding 15 new conditions of approval.  Most of the new conditions were alterations to the conditions imposed by this Commission, such as limiting maximum capacity to 3300 instead of 35oo, changing show times to start at 7 pm or later and end at 11:30 pm or earlier, as well as additional traffic and loading controls.


 


Board of Appeals

            Commissioner Rafael Mandelman resigned and Christine Wang has been sworn in.
