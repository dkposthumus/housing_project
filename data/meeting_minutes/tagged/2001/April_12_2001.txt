(BUFORD: 558-5973)


ISSUANCE 
      OF TAXI MEDALLIONS
 – 
CITYWIDE
 - 
Appeal of Preliminary Negative Declaration.


The San Francisco Taxi Commission, 
      City and County of San Francisco, proposes to issue approximately 500 additional 
      taxi permits ("medallions"). After implementation of the project, 
      the number of taxi permits available in the City would increase from 1,381 
      to 1,881, an increase of approximately 36%.
 
New permits may be issued if supported by a 
      finding that additional permits are required to meet the public convenience 
      and necessity.
 
Once issued, the 
      permits would result in 500 additional taxis in use. Operation of taxis 
      in the City limits is subject to regulation and review by the San Francisco 
      Taxi Commission.
 
Proposition K, 
      a 1978 initiative ordinance governing the operation of taxis in the City, 
      requires that the permits, once issued, be operated continuously.

      pedestrian

Prior use of the site was an auto repair.

1250 MISSOURI STREET
 - west side, between 
      25th and Cesar Chavez Streets, Lots 14, 15 and 16 in Assessor's Block 4287. 
      Request for Discretionary Review of Building Permit No. 9820408, proposing 
      to construct an approximately 53,000 gross square foot light industrial 
      building, in a M-1 (Light Industrial) District, a 65-J Height and Bulk District, 
      and an Industrial Protection Zone.


 
Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary 
      Review and approve the project as proposed.





       
      




 
SPEAKER(S):


 
(-) Sue Hestor






-
          
      




This is an unusual site






-
          
      




It is one of the largest parking lots in the City






-
          
      




Another problems with this project is the layout of the units






-
          
      




We are recycling live/work plans and creating inaccessible commercial uses 
      by policy if we allow this






-
          
      




Planning Commission has the responsibility of saying is this viable? Is 
      this real? Or are people trying to fool us all?






-
          
      




This case should be continued and ask for some accessibility input






-
          
      




Every unit on this mezzanine is inaccessible


(-) Dick Millett, 
      Potrero Boosters Neighborhood Association






-
          
      




This building was presented to him as a live/work project a couple of years 
      ago, and I definitely told them that no way we would support it.






-
          
      




This was an IPZ






-
          
      




It is on a very unimproved street.
 
Are 
      they going to improve it all the way from Cesar Chavez to the site? Or are 
      they just going to improve half of the street?






-
          
      




Traffic for the taxi cabs is going to be horrendous






-
          
      




This is a dead end street and can never be connected with other streets 
      because it dies into the bank of the 25
th 
- 26
th
 Street 
      hill.






-
          
      




There are no future methods proposed of connecting this street with any 
      other street





       
      




(+) Jim Ruben






-
          
      




This is a project that truly has been chasing something of a moving target






-
          
      




When it was purchased in 1988 it was probably not located in an area that 
      was a center of things to begin with.
 
One 
      would hope that the market would have caught up with this land.
 
It didn't and as you know, the market has changed 
      dramatically






-
          
      




We are here to get an approval for something that is not a live/work.


It can't be a live/work. It can be small units for industrial use






-
          
      




There is a minor encroachment permit already achieved.
 
They will improve the street.






-
          
      




Accessibility is no longer an issue






-
          
      




Lockers and shower areas have been added


(+) Nathan Graham, 
      President Yelow Cab Cooperative






-
          
      




The street is indeed in need of improvement






-
          
      




Looking forward for something to be built in that location


(+) Tom Lewis






-
          
      




Developed his own property in 1977 and completed in 1979






-
          
      




In favor on anything that solves the vacancy of the proposed location






-
          
      




This proposed structure is the best use of this property and is consistent 
      with the business and structures of the neighborhood


 
(+) Joe O'Donoghue






-
          
      




Finds it ironic that this is not a developer.
 
This is a woman that had never (developed) anything in her entire 
      life.
 
She is the owner of a market






-
          
      




She changed the plans 3 times






-
          
      




This is an industrial/commercial building

35 LOMBARD STREET
 - 
south side of the street between Taylor and Jones Streets, Lot 020 in Assessor’s 
      Block 0073.
 
Request for Discretionary 
      Review of Building Permit Application No. 2000/07/13/5089S. The subject 
      property contains one structure, a portion of which extends into the required 
      rear yard. The proposal consists of two components: (1) to construct a new 
      425 square foot rear addition on the fourth floor, within the permitted 
      buildable area, and (2) to remove the gable roof, creating a flat roof and 
      deck atop the noncomplying portion of the structure at the rear of the subject 
      property.
 
The height of the roof 
      with proposed deck, on the non-complying portion of the building, will be 
      reduced from 20’-4" to 18’. The site is in an RM-1 (Residential, Mixed, 
      Low Density) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District. 




Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and 
      approve the building permit application with modifications as submitted.

SPEKEAR(S):


 
(-) Rick Sears, 
      Representing DR requestor






-
          
      




They are 3 different buildings built at various times






-
          
      




The proposed space where they want to build now is the only portion left 
      for open space






-
          
      




It will block the light from his windows






-
          
      




They should be in the front of the house, instead of the proposed site


(-) Ms. Alioto, Discretionary 
      Review Requestor (Mr. Rick Sears spoke on her behalf)






-
          
      




Lived in her property for 80 years






-
          
      




Proposed project would block her bedroom light






-
          
      




In 1970 they proposed to build a fence around and they were disapproved






-
          
      




Clearly if they were denied to build just a fence, why would they be allowed 
      to build a building there?






-
          
      




This area was purposely left open 






-
          
      




Urged them to consider an alternative location






-
          
      




Would like to stress that there has not been any effort to compromise


(-) Adam Ng






-
          
      




There will be a severe blockage of view 






-
          
      




Constructing in the front of the property is a viable alternative


(-) Maria Ho






-
          
      




Do not approve the project


(-) Deborah Ng






-
          
      




Lack of light in her parents house would worsen their health






-
          
      




Should be considerate to the neighbors and build in the front of the building


(-) Betty Ng






-
          
      




This structure will impact their property immensely






-
          
      




They should compromise by building in the front






-
          
      




Everyone involved is elderly






-
          
      




We do not oppose her building, but she should do it where she does not 
      affect her neighbors

      of Building Permit Application No. 2000.10.05.2384 proposing to construct 
      a vertical addition to a single-family dwelling in an RH-2 (Residential,

SPEAKER (S):




 
(-) Erick 
      Limesider, representing Discretionary Review Requestor






-
          
      




Owner of this property had lived in this house for more than 50 years






-
          
      




Mr. Benezini, totally disabled, spent a good deal of his time in the house, 
      particularly in the kitchen






-
          
      




The kitchen window that we are concerned with, is the only source of natural 
      light penetrating the house on that side.






-
          
      




The proposed development would cut all the light off






-
          
      




This would be a major impact on the availability of natural light 






-
          
      




Onother issue is the change of structure of the windows on 740 Vermont, 
      overlooking the back yard at 734 Vermont






-
          
      




There is an increase of approximately five windows to about 8, or 6 to 
      9






-
          
      




If this project goes thru, the people at 740 Vermont would have a panoramic 
      view into the back yard of the Benzene's residence






-
          
      




There will not be any privacy

Needs to take care of this issue because of her grandmother's illness

There is plenty of light coming into the building next to hers






-
          
      




Windows are being reduced






-
          
      




They have an illegal deck 






-
          
      




In regard to the illegal window:
 
It 
      is cut in between two other buildings






-
          
      




They can see thru to my house from their deck






-
          
      




They are continuously building in the back of their house illegally






-
          
      




Plans showed we had moved windows away from their home, reducing these 
      windows in order to preserve my privacy


(+) Dick Millett






-
          
      




Neighborhood has been very supportive






-
          
      




Will make a big contribution to the neighborhood
