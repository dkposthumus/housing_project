LIVE-WORK TO LOFT HOUSING AMENDMENT
 - Consideration of adoption of 
amendments to Part II, Chapter II, of the San Francisco Municipal Code (Planning 
Code) by amending Sections 102.7 and 102.13 redefining "live/work" units as 
"loft housing" and classifying them as residential uses; repealing Section 233 
regarding live/work; adding Section 232 to establish requirements for loft 
housing that would subject it to some existing live/work controls except that 
there would be no restriction on the nature of work which could be performed in 
the unit so long as the use is permitted in the SSO (Service/Secondary Office) 
Zoning District and no requirement that the occupant(s) work in the unit, would 
require loft housing to comply with existing inclusionary housing policies, 
would require loft housing in residential areas to comply with all requirements 
for residential uses including the residential design guidelines, would require 
loft housing constructed in areas not zoned residential to comply with 
non-residential design guidelines and all requirements for residential uses 
except for front setback and open space requirements, would establish procedures 
for converting live/work units to non-residential uses, and would establish loft 
housing, rear yard exposure requirements.
  

This ordinance supersedes any inconsistent Planning Commission 
policies.

Applying a legal parking deficiency of 25 spaces for the previous 
industrial use, under Planning Code Section 150 (c)(1), the amount of required 
parking is reduced to 33 spaces. The required parking will be provided off-site 
at 130 Townsend Street, Lot 8 in Assessor’s Block 3788, which is within 800 feet

the most historically successful retail complexes is a shopping center in 
Hawaii.


- 
Fisherman’s Wharf shops are very grateful for the F-line Streetcar of

(-) 
Steve Williams - DR Requestor


- He was 
retained to do a legal analysis of the project.


- The 
houses in the area are absolutely identical and were constructed at the same 
time and by the same builder.


- A 
previous project similar to this one on 22nd Avenue was settled by eliminating 
the 3rd floor.


- This 
house is already the largest house on the block with a large lot.
  
If the proposed addition is approved, 
the house will be twice as large as the neighbors.


- There 
are no additions on either side of the block.


- The 
analysis by the planner is not correct.


(-) 
Michael Dolan


- He was 
not informed as to the proceedings.


- The 
planner never informed him of the proceedings and knew that he was opposed to 
the project.


- This 
is a quiet, peaceful neighborhood.
  

This request is totally obnoxious.
  

It will decrease the value of his home.


(-) Name 
Not Clear


- He 
objects to the addition because it will affect the character of the 
neighborhood.


- He has 
lived in the neighborhood for many years.


- There 
is plenty of room in each home for good-sized families to 
live.


(-) 
Cecilia Suarez


- The 
addition would be okay in the back of the house but not on 
top.


(-) Mark 
Marowitz


- The 
houses are completely uniform.


- There 
is only one property, which is out of character with the rest of the 
homes.


- It 
seems unjust for these types of additions to be built.


(-)Name 
Not Clear


- Read a 
letter from Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan who are opposed to this 
project.


- 
Several years ago there was a similar proposal proposed on the block and there 
were consequences to that proposal.


- If the 
Commissioners lived near the proposed addition, would they approve 
it?


(-)Name 
Not Clear


- He has 
a similarly constructed house as the one proposed.


- He 
would not like his light to be blocked.


 


(-) Jeff 
Rogers - DR Requestor


- He 
submitted over 30 letters and petitions of opposition to this 
addition.


- The 
family of the proposed addition is a relatively small family.
  
Their house is one of the largest in the 
neighborhood.


- They 
did agree to a low-profile plan in the back but subsequently changed their 
minds.


(-) 
Cliff Luger


- He has 
lived in the neighborhood for many years.


- All 
the houses in the Sunset are similarly constructed, then all of a sudden there 
is a big box which is a 3rd story house.


(-) 
Michael Morise Dolan


- He 
grew up in the neighborhood.


- He 
repairs flats and properties in the area where he lives, which is Santiago 
Street.
  
All the houses in that 
neighborhood have similarly constructed homes and have kept it that 
way.


- The 
proposed addition falls out of the character of the 
neighborhood.


(+) John 
Jay - Project Sponsor


- This 
addition complies with all the rules of the Planning Code.


- Mr. 
Euwing has  bent over backwards  to meet the issues of the neighborhood.
  
He has gone to each of the neighbors to 
deal with their issues.


- There 
are some objections including, the addition is out of character to the 
neighborhood; privacy; etc.


(+) Amon 
Euwing


- He has 
a large family and his family is still growing.
  
There is a legal in-law apartment but he 
still needs more space.


- He has 
spoken to all the neighbors and has tried to be sensitive to their 
needs.


(+) 
Darolyn Gin


- Her 
parents bought the house in 1968.


- When 
Mr. Euwing told them about the extension, they agreed to it because they also 
come from a large family and can understand.


(+) Lee 
Rosenthal


- She 
has no objections to the plans to his house.


- 
Homeowners should be able to do to their property depending upon their 
needs.


- She 
would like for this project to be approved.


(+) 
Michael Klestoff


- He 
lives and works in the neighborhood.


- Mr. 
Euwing has done more than what the guidelines require.


- If the 
homes were supposed to be kept the same way all the time, the area would have 
been a planned development and restrictions would have been 
imposed.

At this 
time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to 
the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission 
except agenda items.
  
With respect 
to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded 
when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.
  
When the agenda item has already been 
reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to 
testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to 
address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of 
the Calendar.
  
Each member of the 
public may address the Commission for up to three minutes. 



 


The 
Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not 
appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public 
comment.

comment, the commission is limited to: 


 


(1)
  
responding to statements made or 
questions posed by members of the public; or


(2)
  
requesting staff to report back on a 
matter at a subsequent meeting; or 


(3)
  
directing staff to place the item on a 
future agenda.
