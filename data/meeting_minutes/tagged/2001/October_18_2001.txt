                    Discussion and consideration of proposed amendments to the Planning Commission's Inclusionary Housing Policy.
                    Preliminary Recommendation:  Approval
(Continued from Regular Meeting of October 11, 2001)
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Joe LaTorre – Mayor's Office of Housing.
- The items that are listed in the letter he submitted to the Commission are not focused on the appropriate percentage of units or even the income levels that should be targeted.
- The purpose of this list would be to begin a process of thinking, not because there is any definite outcome.
(+) Dr. Arelious Walker – Pastor of the Church of God in Christ
- He would like to talk about affordable housing offsite (of any particular development project).
- Affordable housing in the Bay View is not going well.
- He has been trying to find a solution to this problem for years.
- He has lost up to 35 families who have moved to other areas of the Bay Area because they cannot afford housing.
(+) Marty Dalton – Private Developer – UPC Holdings
- He was thrilled when Dr. Walker came to him to build affordable housing.
- He shares the vision of Dr. Walker to move some of the inclusionary housing from market rate housing to the neighborhoods to produce affordable housing where it's most needed.
- They did an analysis by looking at the cost of production of housing in a high-rise site downtown and the cost of housing in a low-rise neighborhood offsite.  This would produce more units of the same quality in a smaller amount of time.
- He would like to have the support of the Commission to formulate this mechanism and make this happen. 
(+) Kelley Dearman – Haight Street Mortgage Co.
- There are a lot of people who feel that they cannot afford a home.  They help people to be able to afford affordable homes.
- They have held 1 credit repair and pre-qualification seminar in the Bay View district that had great attendance.
- There are a number of people who are anxious to be homeowners in San Francisco if the opportunity presents itself.
(+) Reverend Arnold Townsend
- They wanted to present a tangible project to show the Commissioners what they mean by moving inclusionary housing off-site where possible.  This would be a good thing for the Commission to adopt as a policy.
- This would provide stability in certain communities that need it so badly.
(+) Tania Alexander – Caring and Restoration Homes/True Hope Church
- She is a native San Franciscan.
- She is one of the persons that Reverend Townsend and Dr. Walker have spoken about since she has had to move away from San Francisco because she couldn't afford to live here.
- All of the work that they (her and her husband) do with the community is done in San Francisco.  Yet she has to cross two bridges in order to come to San Francisco.
(+) Lynn Sedway – Real Estate and Urban Economist and Consultant – Sedway Group
- The Commission is challenged today with the goal that many people have of producing more affordable housing.
- Her firm has worked on this for many years.  It seems easy to increase the percentage of inclusionary housing.  Yet this will cause less housing to be built--particularly in high-rise developments downtown.
(+) Gregory Richardson – Richardson Consultant
- He is in full support of the inclusionary process.
- In order for a City to grow, the community must be stable and have a base.  Without a base there is no hope.
- All Americans have a dream to one day own a home.
- Please consider what is being put on the table and make decisions with harmony and understanding.
(+) Rev. Ed Stewart – Community Assembly of God
- He is in support of this inclusionary process.
- This will provide fine young people in his congregation to be able to find a home.
- This will help to retain energetic and viable people, encourgeing them to remain in this City.
(+) Bill Poland
- There are some aspects of Mr. Gosh's presentation that he disagrees with on costs.
- He has a housing affordability study by Recurs University that was handed out by Urban Land Institute in Boston (he submitted it to the Commissioners).
- The target of necessary housing is understated.
- There are people that want to live here that work in other cities in the Bay Area.
- Demand is very high.  
(+) Pamela Duffy
- She would like to suggest that the Commission consider the inner relationships of various programs designed to deal with housing generation and housing demand through all segments of the housing consumer marketplace ranging from the very low income to the market rate consumer of housing.
(+) Calvin Welc          h – Council for Community Housing Organizations
- He is here to point out that non-profits cannot build their way out of the affordability housing problem and the importance of the inclusionary zoning requirement is key.  This would involve the for profit housing development sector.
- His other point is the extraordinary nature of the affordability gap.
(+) Bob Myers – Architect and City Planning Consultant
- He wanted to summarize the survey that his firm did regarding affordability and inclusionary requirements all the way from San Jose to Sacramento.
- The typical city has either no affordability requirements or 10 percent at the maximum.  Only three jurisdictions exceed that by 15 percent the increased 5 percent above the 10 percent is at 100 percent of median.  That is where they negotiate height, density and parking bonuses.
- The cities that are considering increasing the affordability requirements are worried that they will drive market-rate housing developers away to other communities. 
(-) John Bardis
- Mr. Gosh has made an interesting case.  This is a program that will help improve something that will provide housing to those who might afford it, but the cost of the program would inflate the price of the market-rate housing that would be produced by the same project.
- This would be a flaw in the program.
(+) Tim Tosta – Steffel, Levitt and Weiss
- He recognizes the great complexity and difficulty in changing a policy that has so many needs to meet.
ACTION:          No Action Taken.  Public Comment remains open.  Item will be brought back to the Commission in November.

Good afternoon Commissioners, my name is Boris Delepine, Legislative Assistant to Supervisor Gerardo Sandoval.

- This residential neighborhood is already saturated with antennas.
- On October 1, the neighborhood requested a meeting with the project sponsor and with Sutro Tower.  The meeting occurred on October 10.  The neighborhood learned that this site is not technologically necessary for Metro to deliver services to its customers.  The neighbors also learned Metro customers would be better served by a system that is relatively low to the ground, more typical of the wireless industry.
- The fact that the other wireless carriers can deliver service to its customers without antennas on Sutro Tower suggests that this is technologically feasible for Metro as well.
- The neighborhood residents should not have to bear the consequences of Metro's poor planning.
- There are other safety issues regarding this proposal as well.
(-) Doris S. Linnenbach – 
- Since 1966, she has been attending meetings regarding Sutro Tower.
- This tower was a television tower and an FM tower.  She was never told that this tower would have so much cellular antennas.
- She would like to have the Commission take Discretionary Review and be allowed to have some meaningful dialogue with Sutro Tower.
(-) Tracey Hughes - SNAFU
- She hopes that the Commission listens to the people here who are against this project.
- All antennas need to follow the WTS Guidelines and this does not. Maybe it's tricky and it can be exempt but she is not sure.
- There are different frequencies that antennas use and it could cause problems with frequencies for 911.
- Members of the community do not have  big hot shot  lawyers to do their research for them.
- It's time that these antennas are stopped.
ACTION:          Did not take Discretionary Review and approved the building permit with the standard conditions for facilities on Sutro Tower.  
AYES:          Baltimore, Chinchilla, Fay, Joe, Salinas, Theoharis

F.          PUBLIC COMMENT
At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes. 
The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public comment, the commission is limited to: 
(1)  responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or
(2)  requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or 
(3)  directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.  (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))

Re:  Letters from Dr. Abdul Ashtani
- On Tuesday night she heard a wonderful broadcast by a structural engineer by the name of Abdul Ashtani, He has been commissioned by the Federal Government to investigate the World Trade Towers.  This engineer worked with them pro bono to investigate Sutro Tower.  He said that Sutro Tower had seen better days.  It is an interesting thing to watch.  Dr. Ashtani wrote two letters.  She will include Dr. Ashtani's letters and a picture of Sutro Tower in a folder.

Re: Structural Stability Study
- During the last hearing, the Commission heard insistently that Sutro Tower conduct additional structural stability studies.  In the last nine months Sutro Tower has conducted every study that every expert has recommended they do.  Sutro Tower will be submitting new building permit applications in December.  At that time any member of the public (who wishes) will be invited to view that data.
- On behalf of Sutro Tower, they are amenable to holding community meetings with representatives of TPIA and Midtown Terrace before that application goes forward.
