        STREET
 - north side between Spruce and Locust Streets; Lot 
        9 in Assessor's Block 1011.
 
Request 
        for Conditional-Use Authorization pursuant to Planning Code Section 724.53, 
        to allow Business or Professional Service on the first floor of the subject 
        property.
 
The legal use of the 
        building includes a restaurant (Tuba Garden, which is now vacant) on the 
        first floor and a dwelling unit on the second floor. The second floor 
        dwelling unit was converted to office use and is currently occupied by 
        a property management firm.
 
The 
        proposal is to convert the restaurant space to a business or professional 
        service on the first floor and restore one parking space in the basement.
 
Since the Planning Code does not permit business 
        or professional service use above the first floor, the project is required 
        to restore the dwelling unit at the second floor level.
 
The subject property is located in the 
        Sacramento Street NCD (Neighborhood Commercial District) with a 40-X Height 
        and Bulk District.

Discussion of Planning 
        Code Requirements for Bay Windows


 
(Continued from Regular 
        Meeting of February 15, 2001)





         
        




- Jonathan Pearlman, Architect, raised this item during a public 
        comment portion of the calendar at a previous hearing.
 
His question was how the Planning Department 
        was implementing the bay window provisions to the Planning Code, which 
        have been in place for a number of years but it hasn't been formally modified.


- What it states is that when a bay window is determined, what 
        is measured is the amount of glass.
 
Earlier 
        bay windows did not have glass on the sides.


-
 
The requirement was 
        that 50% of the areas of the vertical surfaces be of glass and that at 
        least 1/3 of that glass be on the face of the building, parallel to the 
        street and 1/3 of glass be on the side pieces of the window, perpendicular 
        to the street.


- He (ZA) hasn't heard that this is a big issue; he has spoken 
        to various architects that have not expressed concerns.


- He will continue to look further into this and will report 
        more information if either

        Mr. Pearlman or the Commissioners have more questions.

        and reduce the height of the project, passed by a vote

        +5 –1, Commissioner Joe voted No.

SPEAKER(S):


(+) Alice 
        Barkley


- 
She faxed 
        a letter requesting for the project be continued but she wanted to publicly 
        state the reason for the continuance.


- At around 10:00 p.m. last night, during the Board of Appeals 
        hearing, Ms. Hestor handed her a stack of papers, which included a request 
        for continuance as well as a brief submitted by Mr. Butler.
 
She (Ms. Barkley) obviously did not have time 
        to review the material since she didn't get out of the Board of Appeals 
        hearing until 11:30 p.m.


- When she returned to her office she discovered that there 
        was a fax from Ms. Hestor, which arrived after the Board of Appeals hearing 
        had started.
 
At that time, she 
        was already at the Board of Appeals hearing.


(-) Joseph 
        Butler


- Part of the problem Ms. Barkley has had is that he finished 
        his brief and distributed it to the Commissioners on Tuesday night.


The copy to staff and Ms. Barkley was delivered on Wednesday.


He also delivered a copy to Ms. Barkley during the Board of Appeals 
        hearing via Ms. Hestor.
 
He realizes 
        that things should have been done in a more timely matter yet he received 
        information needed for the brief late.

Preliminary Recommendation: 
        Adopt Resolution formulating Preliminary Plan and finding said plan generally 
        consistent with General Plan





         
        






SPEAKER (S):


(+) Maria Ayerdi – Mayor's Office of Economic Development 
        and Mayor's Transbay Terminal/Caltrain Project Director.


- The reason 
        why this project is of such vast importance is because it addresses two 
        major issues of San Francisco--traffic congestion and lack of housing.


- The site 
        would be our own Grand Central Station at the current Transbay Terminal.


- The facility 
        would be a 5-level intermodal bus and rail transit station, which would 
        be a model for integrating regional, state and nation-wide public transportation.


- The new 
        facility will be an exceptional, environmentally sustainable station that 
        will provide service to AC Transit, Samtrans and Golden Gate Transit.


- The new 
        facility will also provide expanded service to MUNI and Caltrain Station 
        service.


- The parcel 
        surrounding the terminal will provide at least 3,000 housing units.


- Groundbreaking 
        is expected by 2003.


(+) Karen Oshburn – SMWM Architects – Professional Consultant 
        Team


- Showed 
        a Powerpoint presentation of the design of the new Transbay Terminal.


- There have 
        been various plans that have come forth regarding the design of the terminal 
        but none has had as much support from the various agencies.


- The current 
        design will allow excellent connection to the various transit services 
        of other cities.


- Using public 
        transportation is part of everyday life.


- All the 
        services will come into the terminal; that way people can access all these 
        services conveniently.


- Below grade 
        will have six tracks for Caltrain and high speed rail; the next level 
        up (ground surface) will access MUNI; the concourse level will contain 
        retail, the next level up will service AC Transit; the next level which 
        is a half level up will service Greyhound.


(+) Jim Haas – Member of the Transbay Citizen's Advisory 
        Committee for the Survey Area


- 
Everyone who has been involved in 
        this project has done a tremendous job and has been working very hard 
        to make this project happen.


- This project 
        will not receive Federal or State funds.
 
The only way this will happen will be to use public properties as 
        well as tax increments.


- The CAC 
        has not taken a position on the detail plans.


He feels confident that they will endorse this project.


- There is 
        a consensus, at least among the CAC, that in the Rincon Hill area there 
        are opportunities for increased heights, for housing, incentives for adding 
        affordable housing along Folsom Street, etc.


So he hopes that the Commission and staff will again start working 
        on the Rincon Hill Rezoning.


(-) Lloyd Schlagle


- This is 
        a very busy and successful transit area.


- The proposal 
        is very disruptive.
 
Also, the 
        voters had voted this proposal down before, meaning that this proposal 
        is not supported.


- When completed, 
        this area would be just too busy.


- The City 
        can save itself building this proposal since there is a transit facility 
        already.


- A moratorium 
        should be established on large office buildings since there are many already.


These types of constructions should be put on hold until the next 
        generation of builders.


- Presently 
        there are signs of being overbuilt.


(+) Clark Manus


- He would 
        encourage the Commission to approve this project.


- It's the 
        kind of project that this City needs.

        Street to The Embarcadero between Mission and Howard Streets, Lot 002 
        in Assessor’s Block 3715.
 
Request 
        under Planning Code Section 309(g) for City Planning Commission Review 
        related to Compliance with Section 138 for the Project proposed in Building 
        Permit Application No. 2000/12/11/7669S/R1, which consists of the renovation 
        of an existing two-story-over-basement building at 115 Steuart Street, 
        and the addition of three new floors.


The modified building would contain up to 23,500 square feet of 
        net new office space and a 720 square-foot rooftop open space.
 
The project lies within a C-3-O Zoning District and an 84-X Height 
        and Bulk District.


 
Preliminary Recommendation:
 
Staff recommends that the Commission determine 
        not to conduct a hearing (pursuant to Section 309(g)).





         
        




SPEAKER(S):


(+) Andrew Junius – Reuben and Alter – Representative of Project Sponsor


- He's not going to speak much especially 
        since Ms. Hestor is not present.


- He agrees with everything that 
        the planner has said.


- The only reason they are here today 
        is because of a letter that Ms. Hestor sent to the Department, which was 
        dated January 16, 2001.
 
This letter 
        doesn't even meet the minimum threshold of asking for a hearing under 
        Section 309(g).
 
Under this section, 
        a person is supposed to identify modifications that one wants, state why 
        the modifications are necessary and what policies they might support and 
        state why there is something wrong with the project's open space and why 
        it doesn't comply with the code.
 
Ms. 
        Hestor's letter doesn't state any of this.


ACTION:
 
Determined not to 
        conduct a hearing.

2210 43rd Avenue
 - 
east side, between Rivera and Santiago Streets, Lot 041 in 
        Assessor’s Block 2307.
 
Request 
        for Discretionary Review to add a third story to the existing two-story 
        single-family home. The front wall of the addition would be set back 3 
        feet from the existing front building wall and will have a balcony at 
        the roof of the second story. The plans have been revised to make the 
        rear wall of the new story even with the existing rear building wall, 
        in the RH-1 (Residential, House, One-Family) District and a 40-X Height 
        and Bulk District. Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review 
        and approve the Building Permit Application with modifications.





         
        




SPEAKER(S):


(-) Carol Ann Sanders – DR Requestor


- She is concerned about her view 
        and the neighborhood.


- There aren't any houses in the 
        neighborhood this tall.


- She is concerned about the impact 
        there will be on parking.


- The proposed construction will 
        have eight rooms, which is just too much.


- She submitted a letter from a neighbor 
        who has her same concerns.


(-) Antoinette Bolonokoft – 2
nd
 DR Requestor


-
 She lives across the street from the proposed project.


- Her concern in the impact the project 
        will have on the neighborhood since this building is just too large for 
        the area.


- She doesn't have any problems with 
        the addition but she is not in agreement with the design.


- This project will not fit in, even 
        with the three-foot setback.


- She agrees with the planner on 
        many things but other items are just not right.


(-) Ray O'Leary


- He lives across the street from 
        the proposed project.


- He has been a resident of this 
        block for 46 years.


- He just surveyed 300 houses and 
        there are no vertical additions.
 
There 
        have been horizontal ones but not vertical.


- The neighborhood is so uniform 
        that this structure will change the image.


A box-like structure just does not fit into the neighborhood.
 


- If it could be modified, he would 
        go along with it.


(-) Raul Artiga


- He agrees with the comments the 
        previous neighbors have stated.


- He would also like to have the 
        3
rd
 floor addition removed.


- The addition can be done horizontal 
        with no problem.


- He provided some plans for the 
        Commissioners with the design he recommends.


(+) Annie Chong – Project Sponsor


- She and her sister are proposing 
        this project.


- The proposed project will be a 
        single-family home.


- They will be removing one of the 
        bedrooms on the second floor to make a bigger living room.


- It is her culture to have all her 
        family together.
 
Right now there 
        are seven family members living there.


They don't have any intention to have more people living there.


- There are various two and three-story 
        buildings in the neighborhood.


- They have spoken to a lot of people, 
        which are in support of the project.


Many people are working so she didn't feel comfortable enough to 
        ask them to come to the hearing.


- There are not going to be additional 
        people living there so there will not be additional parking problems.


(+) Ann Berry – Neighbor


- She loves all her neighbors.


She is very honored to have the project sponsor's family as neighbors 
        for 10 years.
 
They always keep the home clean.
 
Their family is large but they are very united.




- She doesn't mind the construction 
        to be vertical.
 


- Families are very important.


(+) Ana Chong – Co-Sponsor


- She is married and has a son.


Since he was born, the three of them were sharing a room.


- She would like to have more room 
        so that their son can have his own room.


- She would like the Commission to 
        approve the project.


ACTION:
 
Take DR and approve 
        project with modifications.

2634 25th Avenue
 - 
east side between Vicente and Wawona Streets, Lot 044 in Assessor’s 
        Block 2472.
 
Request for Discretionary 
        Review to construct a one-story vertical addition to the existing two-story, 
        single-family home. This addition will be set back 5’-8" from the 
        existing front building wall, and will stop 3’-6" short of the existing 
        rear building wall. A portion of the roof deck proposed to the rear of 
        the addition, which houses a fire escape, would overhang the rear yard 
        by 4’-10" in the RH-1 (Residential, House, One-Family) District and 
        a 40-X Height and Bulk District. 


 
Preliminary Recommendation: 
        Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the Building Permit Application 
        as submitted.





         
        




SPEAKER (S):
 


(-) Roger Wong – DR Requestor


- 
As soon as he became aware of the project, he was concerned 
        that the proposed project would block his sunlight.


- He contacted the project sponsor 
        in order to reach a compromise so that at least his light well would not 
        be blocked.


- He wasn't able to contact the project 
        sponsor so he contacted a neighborhood association.
 
When a meeting was scheduled, the project sponsor did not show up.


- So he figured that applying for 
        a Discretionary Review would be the way to go about it.


- He bought his house because it 
        has a lot of light and air.
 
Neighbors 
        should respect other neighbors.


- There is also a potential problem 
        of leakage between the buildings.
 
This 
        concern was brought to the architect but the architect did not respond.


- A side setback would eliminate 
        many problems.


- He has no objection to development 
        but it should not be done at his expense.


- He passed to the Commissioners 
        a petition signed by various neighbors who are in support of the project 
        and agree to the good-neighbor modifications to the design.


(-) did not state name


- She lives near the proposed project.


- She is concerned about having a 
        third story built in her neighborhood.


- There is one house that has a third 
        story and it is an ugly thing.


- There is a lot of fog in the area 
        and creating a third story would block sunlight to the Wong's home, which 
        will cause mold and mildew in their home.


- A little consideration has to be 
        given.


(+) Robert Mins – Project Architect


- Susan Chong and he are pleased 
        to be working on a design for an addition that is respecting the neighborhood 
        pattern as well as being integrated with the neighborhood pattern as well.


- Some of the neighbors are concerned 
        that there is a boxed structure across the street and the neighbors feel 
        that the design he is proposing will be similar.


- He displayed pictures of the proposed 
        construction.


- This proposal is very close to 
        the planning design guidelines.


- They have added many architectural 
        elements that respect the neighborhood pattern.


- The addition follows the existing 
        block face and rhythm of the street.


- After meeting with the DR requestor 
        and reviewing some of the concerns of the neighbors, they have made revisions 
        for both the neighborhood and DR requestor.


- The DR requestor is concerned that 
        people hanging out from the fire escape balcony of the proposed construction, 
        could easily travel onto his roof.
 
The architect has made various changes in order to solve this problem.


- The DR requestor disapproves of 
        Spanish-type tiles.
 
But the predominant 
        look of the other homes is Spanish.


- He performed a shadow study and 
        he discovered that there would be no change in sunlight after the construction 
        compared to the current home design.


- The DR requestor claimed that due 
        to wind-blown rain, the DR requestor's drainage system would be overloaded.


He conducted a calculation and taking into consideration the vertical 
        wall, his downspout can handle 2.5 times the amount of water from a severe 
        storm.


ACTION:
 
Take 
        DR and approve project as mended but removing the third floor rear screens.
