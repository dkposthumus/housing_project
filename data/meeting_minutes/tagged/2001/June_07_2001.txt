4038 
    17TH STREET
 - north side between Castro and Douglass Streets, Lot 011 
    in
 
Assessor's Block 2623.  Request of Discretionary Review of Building 
    Demolition Permit Application No. 9814005 and Building Permit Application 
    No. 9814006. The proposal would alter an existing vacant one‑story over 
    garage, single‑family dwelling into a three‑story over garage, 
    three‑family dwelling in an RH‑3 (Residential, House, Three‑Family) 
    District and a 40‑X Height and Bulk District. Note: This project was 
    previously heard by the Commission on April 6, 2000 and May 10, 2001, respectively. 
    Following public testimony on April 6, 2000, the Commission moved to continue 
    the hearing indefinitely, so the Project Sponsor could develop a design that 
    
(1) does not require demolition of the existing structure (the demolition 
    building permit application will be withdrawn by the project sponsor); (2) 
    retains a substantial portion of the front part of the Victorian house; and 
    (3) allows three dwelling units to be constructed on the site.
 The revised 
    project proposes to retain approximately 42 feet of the front of the existing 
    building which includes both exterior sidewalls and some of the interior walls. 
    The existing facade would be preserved and moved forward by approximately 
    3 feet 4 inches and lowered by approximately 4 feet. The facade would be attached 
    to a reinforced and expanded structure constructed between its new location 
    and the existing portions of the sidewalls, which are to remain in place. 
    The sidewalls would be extended downward by approximately 4 feet and the 3‑foot 
    11‑inch parapet would be removed. The revised project would further 
    include building additions above and behind the retained portion of the existing 
    building, resulting in a three‑story over garage, three‑family 
    dwelling. The revised project would also require the justification of a rear 
    yard variance, which will be heard by the Zoning Administrator concurrently 
    with the discretionary review.

north side between Castro and Douglass Streets; Lot 011 in Assessor's 
    Block 2623 in an RH‑3 (Residential, House, Three‑Family) District 
    and a 40‑X Height and Bulk District.  REAR YARD VARIANCE SOUGHT: Subject 
    to Discretionary Review by the Planning Commission, the current proposal is 
    to alter an existing vacant one‑story over garage, single‑family 
    dwelling by remodeling it into a three‑story over garage, three‑family 
    dwelling in an RH‑3 (Residential, House, Three‑Family) District 
    and a 40‑X Height and Bulk District.  Note: This project was previously 
    heard by the Commission on April 6, 2000 and May 10, 2001, respectively. Following 
    public testimony on April 6, 2000, the Commission adopted a Motion to continue 
    indefinitely, so the Project Sponsor could develop a design that (1) does 
    not require demolition of the existing structure, (2) retains a substantial 
    portion of the front part of the Victorian house and (3) allows three units 
    to be constructed on the site. The revised project proposes to retain approximately 
    42 feet of the front of the existing building which includes both exterior 
    side walls and some of the interior walls. The existing facade would be preserved 
    and moved forward by approximately 3 feet 4 inches and lowered by approximately 
    4 feet. The facade would be attached to a reinforced and expanded structure 
    constructed between its new location and the existing portions of the sidewalls, 
    which are to remain in place. The sidewalls would be extended downward by 
    approximately 4 feet and the 3‑foot 11‑inch parapet would be removed. 
    The revised project would further include building additions above and behind 
    the retained portion of the existing building, resulting in a three‑story 
    over garage, three‑family dwelling. The revised project would also require 
    the justification of a rear yard variance which will be heard by the Zoning 
    Administrator concurrently with the discretionary review.  Section 136(c)(25) 
    of the Planning Code allows enclosed and  unenclosed  extensions of  


                        buildings, as  permitted  
    obstructions,  to  extend  no  more  than  12  feet into the 


                        required open area, provided 
    that the structure shall be limited to a height not exceeding the floor level 
    of the second floor of occupancy, excluding the ground story, at the rear 
    of the building on the subject property, in which case the structure shall 
    be no closer than 5 feet to any interior side lot line. Section 134(c) requires 
    a minimum rear yard of approximately 35 feet, measured from the mid‑point 
    of the rear property line for the subject lot. The new addition to be constructed 
    behind the retained portion of the front part of the existing building would 
    be three stories tall, extending 12 feet into the required rear yard to be 
    within approximately 33 feet 6 inches of the rear property line and would 
    encroach entirely into the required 5‑foot separation from the east 
    side lot line and from the west side lot line, respectively.

            8.         Commission Matters


Commissioner Lim:      - There was an audit 
    completed by the Department of the Controller regarding Development Impact 
    Fees.  This audit was sent to the BOS on May 30.  There was a resolution that 
    was passed urging the Planning Commission to certify existing studies calculating 
    the average area purchase price for the development fees.  She would like 
    to know what would be the best way to respond to this audit.  
{This shall 
    be calendared under Director's Report during the hearing of June 21, 2001, 
    which will allow for public comment.}


                                 - There have 
    been a lot of discussions at the BOS regarding the budget for the Planning 
    Department.  She would like the Director to reiterate the importance of this 
    budget to the BOS since there are 3 Supervisors who are very concerned about 
    the Planning process of their districts: Sup. Maxwell, Sup. Daly and Sup. 
    Sandoval.   
{This shall be calendared for a hearing during July 2001.}


 
President TheoharIs:      
    
- She saw the BOS meeting on Monday and read an article in the newspaper 
    about the rezoning of Rincon Hill.  One of the Supervisors mentioned that 
    the Planning Commission was approving this project and the Supervisor was 
    disturbed.  The Commission has not been presented this project.  There should 
    be an Environmental Impact Report done and then a hearing will be scheduled 
    to receive input from the public.  She wanted to clarify this to the public 
    and asked Director Green to help the Commission clarify this to the public.  
    She would like the Director to get in touch with Sup. Daly to obtain any names 
    of people who might want to receive the Environmental Reports.

-      What 
    happened to the other 9 tenants that were burned out of these units?


 
-     Further 
    accountability and proper appropriate management standards for these SRO units 
    have to be put in place and watched.


 
-
          
    
 
There is an incredible amount of 
    need for SRO housing


 
(+) Gabriel 
    Metcalf, Deputy Director of SPUR


 
-
          
    
 We believe this is a good project


-     A lot of SROs that are burned out are hard to be replaced


-     This developer has found a way to help the people who lost their homes.


 
-
          
    
 
This is a textbook-planning example--where 
    new parking should be part of it, especially in this City that has a huge 
    parking crisis.

Urged the Commission to support it.
