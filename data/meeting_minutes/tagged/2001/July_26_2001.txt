B.          COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS

<<Project Start>>
4.          Commission Matters
Commissioner Lim:
During the last hearing of the Board of Supervisors, Supervisor Leno proposed a resolution that the Planning Commission should not approve projects that does not include housing even if a Conditional Use permit is not required for the approval.  Supervisor Leno gave an example of a project that was approved recently by the Planning Commission that is located on Market and Polk.  Because the project did not require a Conditional Use permit, the inclusionary affordable housing was only five percent.  Supervisor Leno suggested that the Commission not approve projects that don't have inclusionary housing.  She believes that the supervisor is misinformed.  She knows that the Commission has most always approved projects that have at least 10 percent of inclusionary housing.  Since Supervisor Leno is misinformed, she would like to clarify the policy of this Commission to the supervisor.  She urges the Commission to expedite Commissioner Chinchilla's request about looking into the policies that cover inclusionary housing.
Commissioner Chinchilla:
He agrees that Supervisor Leno is misinformed.  The only reason that this Conditional Use was not applied to the project on Market and Polk Street is because there is a flaw in the policy.  He requests that the Planning Department review and potentially update the policy.  It might be a drafting error.
Commissioner Salinas:
He requested information on the timeline of projects that have inclusionary housing.  He is concerned that we have affordable housing that is in great demand but the process is not an expeditious one.  He would like the Department to provide Commissioners with the most current 30 projects and determine the timeline for each project.  The Commissioners are willing to help make this process an expeditious one.

5.          Director's Announcements
Larry Badiner (Acting Director)
Re:  Supervisor Leno's Concern:
It is not that the Commission is avoiding applying 10 percent affordability.  He agrees that there is a drafting error and this was carried into Supervisor Leno's current proposal.  The project located on Market and Polk did not require a Conditional Use so this was an exception.  Another question and/or issue would be that another potential requirement should be a variance.  Director Green has committed to having a hearing regarding these issues.

The project is located in a C-3-O(SD) (Downtown Office, Special Development) District, and a 150-S Height and Bulk District.
                    Preliminary Recommendation:  Approval with conditions.

                    - There are businesses surrounding this project.
                    - This project is not necessary at all.
                    - This is not a good place for this type of project.

                    - The developer is trying to squeeze in too many units

                    - He would like the Commission to stick to the 10 percent policy.
                    - There should be a lot of open space throughout the building.
                    - This building is providing TDR's.
                    - This project is providing housing in the downtown as opposed to office use and this is a good thing.

SPEAKER(S):
(-) Mr. Rothman – President of the Laurel Heights Improvement Association
- There are many additions, which have been made in this neighborhood, and the Commission has always approved proper additions.

- Character is quite an important issue.
- They are seeking to protect the light, air and rear yards of the properties.  Vertical extensions would jeopardize the neighborhood.
- The general feeling of the neighborhood should be protected by the code.

- He displayed a model of how the proposed construction is compared to the adjacent buildings.
(+) John Cushel – Planning Consultant
- He has been a planning consultant for many years.
- There are 16 letters, all from immediate neighbors, who are supporting this project.
- He had a discussion with Supervisor Newsom, and they have no intension to do any legislation on this matter.  They are not in favor of down zoning and would not introduce anything related to this matter.
- As a result of all this, a new organization--Laurel Heights Alliance, has been created.
- There are a number of substantial 4-story buildings in the neighborhood.
- This construction is just for a family who would like a place for their mother to live in.

- She owns a pair of flats in the neighborhood.
- There was a letter that was sent to the Laurel Heights Improvement Association, which had misinformation regarding this project.

- They believe that they will be able to have children and would like to at some point made additions to their property.
- If this project is not approved, it will keep young families from coming into the neighborhood and growing.
- There have been some inaccuracies related to this project.
(+) Don Holter
- He lives on Collins Street
- He supports the project sponsor.
- As a neighbor in the area, he is against the statement that there are various neighbors who are against this neighborhood.
- The houses in the neighborhood are quite expensive so this is not an inexpensive neighborhood.

- One of the major reasons they ask for the support of the Commission is so that the church will be able to provide housing from the budget they have.
- This particular property fits their financial capabilities and is close to the church.
- This would not be detrimental to the neighborhood.
- On behalf of the Bishop, he hopes the Commission will approve the project.
(+) Father Jason Parkin – Pastor of St. Mary the Virgin
- This project has been a commitment for various years and has been growing strongly.
- Churches are not well equipped and are not interested in becoming landlords.
- He is here not only as a pastor but also as a father and husband.
- The issue here is not about the Parkin family but about the ministry of this church and this community.
ACTION:          Discretionary Review was not taken.  The proposed merger was allowed with the following condition:  Must construct a basement unit.

15.          2001.0209D          (JONES: 558-6477)
                    235 SANTA PAULA AVENUE - between Yerba Buena Avenue and San Jacinto Way, Lot 026 in Assessor's Block 3078, request for Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application No. 2001/12/21/8505, proposing for the construction of a two-story rear horizontal extension to the existing two-story, single-family residence in an RH-1(D) (Residential, House, One-Family Detached Dwellings) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
                    Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take DR and approve as submitted.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Sue Hestor – Representing DR Requestor
- She displayed a picture showing the front of the subject property and adjacent properties.
- There is a rather steep grade between Santa Paula and Yerba Buena.  As a result, the lot is fairly shallow and the DR requestor looks into a hill.
- The addition is to the rear of the house.
- They are requesting that instead of the addition going straight up from the old addition, that the 2nd floor be set back 3Â½ feet and instead of having a pitched roof, to have a flat roof; so windows can continue to look out at the sky; 
(-) Lisa Jacobson
- She lives on Santa Paula Avenue
- She purchased her home in 1995 and has one of the smallest homes in the Saint Francis Woods area.
- One of the many things she loves about her house is the cottage style.
- The proposed construction will block 3 windows that provide sunlight to her home.
- She would like the addition to be pushed back 3Â½ feet and for the roof to be flat so she won't loose so much of the natural sunlight.
(-) Arnie Lerner – Architect
- He was asked by the project sponsor to view the design.
- He displayed pictures of the project.
- He doesn't believe that the requests that they have made are unreasonable since they don't affect the urban design or the character of the neighborhood.
(-) Peter Van Dousky
- He and his wife have lived in Saint Francis Woods for over 18 years.
- The peaked roof from the proposed construction will block light from their yard and to their office located on the first floor of their house.
- They support the proposed modifications suggested by DR requestor.
(-) Vanessa Marque
- She lives on Yerba Buena.
- She wasn't able to be here for the first meeting but she is here today representing her next door neighbors as well.
- It is very disconcerting that trees have been cut down and now they are proposing the addition.
(+) Robert Crem – Project Sponsor
- He lives on Santa Paula Street
- They moved into their home in 1999.
- They discovered that there were several structural problems with the home.  They hired an architect to help them fix these structural problems yet keep the design and character of the home.
- He met with their neighbors and members of the homeowner's association.
- They have worked very cooperatively with their neighbors.
- They have letters of support from various neighbors and organizations.
- The DR requestor has not been too cooperative.
- He believes that his project is very modest and hopes that the Commission will approve his project.
(+) John Lau – Civil Engineer and Building Designer
- He has been a building designer for over 30 years.
- The main structural problem with the property was the foundation.
- He came up with a plan to improve the foundation and increase the size of the home with a design that would match the character of the neighborhood.

F.          PUBLIC COMMENT
At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes. 
The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public comment, the commission is limited to: 
(1)  responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or
(2)  requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or 
(3)  directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.  (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))
Sue Hestor
Re:  311 Notice Process
- In the past month, she has had 3 cases where after notices were sent out, the plans went to DBI and they suggested changes to the plans.  She has been speaking to DBI, planning and BOS in order to try to get out of this impasse.
- If an expansion of the building envelope happens while the project is going through the approval process of DBI it should get another 311 Section notice.
- It is frustrating to have to deal with these cases when they are under construction or they are at the Board of Appeals.
- This needs to be dealt with and the Commission needs to be aware of how important this issue is.
Adjournment: 6:30 p.m.
THE DRAFT MINUTES ARE PROPOSED FOR ADOPTION AT THE REGULAR MEETING OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 2001.
ACTION:          Approved
PRESENT:          Baltimore, Chinchilla, Fay, Joe, Lim, Salinas
ABSENT:          Theoharis
