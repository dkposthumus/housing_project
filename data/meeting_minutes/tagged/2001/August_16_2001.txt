          10.          Commission Matters
Commissioner Baltimore:
Re:  Bay View 
She would like to request that staff invite members of the PAC of Bay View Hunters Point and the Redevelopment Agency.
Director Green will schedule this item under the Director's Report on September 6, 2001.
Commissioner Chinchilla:
Re:  Transportation and Land Use Committee Meeting
He was able to view the committee's last meeting and was upset to see that an unnamed Supervisor criticized an unnamed Planning Commissioner for the Planning Commissioner honoring his oath of office and requiring the City to enforce the affordable housing policy as written.  He is glad that there are rules and regulations in order to avoid arbitrating capricious actions on the part of governmental agencies and wayward and misguided legislators.
Commissioner Salinas
Re:  Continuances
He is opposed to the kind of continuances which are happening at the Planning Commission Hearings since this is causing a  domino affect  on the remainder of the hearings scheduled.
C.          DIRECTOR'S REPORT
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
          11.          Director's Announcements
Re:  Continuances
- He realizes the frustration everyone is having regarding continuances.
- Many times the request for a continuance is because the case might be close to being settled.  This would justify the continuance.
Re:  Special Use District – Industrial Protection Zone for the Bay View Hunter's Point
- Because of the fact that Mr. Maltzer had to be hospitalized, this item will be  continued to September 6, 2001 and not on August 23, 2001 as it had been originally scheduled.
Re:  Commissioner Baltimore's Request
- The PAC of the Bay View Hunter's Point area will be scheduled on September 6, 2001.
Re:  De Young Museum
- On Monday, August 20, 2001, Paul Maltzer and he will be attending the Board of Supervisors meeting to respond to an appeal of an action the Commission took regarding certifying the environmental impact report on the new De Young Museum.  The Board of Supervisors will determine if this document is accurate.  Unfortunately, the document is inaccurate since some of the data which the department received was flawed.  This caused the report to be inaccurate in regards to the shadow analysis report.  The consultants did not do the proper investigation.  The director will request that the document be remanded back to the Planning Commission and a hearing can be held on an updated and accurate document.
Re:  Neighborhoods Program
- They have been working with neighborhoods and neighborhood representatives.
- There will be 3 workshops for Balboa Park which will be on September 5, 2001; September 8, 2001; September 19, 2001.
- There are mailers which are being sent today.
- A public workshop on September 25, 2001 will be held regarding the Waterfront.
- They are working on a workshop in early October for the Market and Octavia workshops.

                    1725 LAKE STREET - south side between 18th and 19th Avenues, Lot 035 in Assessor’s Block 1378 - Requests for Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application No. 2000/07/03/4299’S’ proposing to add two floors, an extension to the rear and additions to both sides and the front of an existing single-family house in an RH-2 (House, Two-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District. 
                    Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the building permit application as revised.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Steve Williams – Representing one of the DR requestors.
- This is the same case that was brought to the Commission about 3 years ago.
- The Commission stated findings on this case on March 20, 1998.  At that time the Commission found that this project was in violation of the priority policies of the Master Plan and the Housing Element of the Master Plan.
- There is a petition that has 80 names of people opposed to the project in 1998.
- There is a resolution from San Francisco Neighborhoods who oppose the project.
- He walked from his house up to the subject house and took a photo of the small houses along the way.  This project would set a precedent in this neighborhood.
- Last time, there was a unanimous decision to oppose this project.
(-) Larry Minnich – 2nd DR requestor
- He lives on Lake Street
- They felt that the neighborhood did not get a notice of the hearing.
- This is a replay of a situation 3 years ago.  It also went to the Board of Appeals.
- A sound affordable house will be replaced by a 4-story monster structure.
- The packet indicated that the neighbors were not concerned and that they were not opposed.  This is not true.  There have been about 80 signatures from people who have signed a petition in opposition to this project.
- There were many people who were not able to attend because they couldn't take time off from work. 
- He would like the 4th story eliminated.
- He likes his neighbors but he is just opposed to the project.
(-) Carl Marshall – 3rd DR Requestor
- He was also here in 1998 and the review board in 1999.
- The house is the same as it was at that time.
- His house looks good if you drive by it.
- They already have a 4th story in this neighborhood.
- The project sponsors are good people but the project is just too large.
- They have had very little notice about this hearing.
- They are against destroying this little house.
- He hopes that the Commission remembers the history a few years ago about this house.
(-) Yasuko Morimoto
- She has lived in this house for 31 years.
- These houses are the last of those built in 1906.  She knows that the neighbors fought hard to save the house and not be demolished in 1998.  They have also gone to 3 appeal hearings.
- This construction would be just as large as the original developer's construction.
- She hopes that there will be some kind of compromise so that everyone can enjoy the quality of life they have and be able to share the air and light.
(-) Elizabeth Jasper
- She lives on Lake Street.
- She understands the need for people to have families and be able to enjoy their space but his project will change the character of the neighborhood.
- She will loose sunlight and a bit of privacy if this project is approved.
- It appears that the project sponsor has the financial possibilities to find a larger home.
(-) Anne Ingram
- She has lived on Lake Street for over 3 years.
- She realizes that this family is allowed to grow and build a larger home, yet this project will block their view and cause the sunlight coming into their apartment to be minimized.
(-) Hiroshi Fokuda
- He belongs to the Richmond Neighborhood Association
- This project was too large a few years ago and it's still too large.
- San Francisco is a great City and one of the things that makes this City great is its diversity.
- If this family wanted a larger house, they should have purchased a larger house.
- In the Lake Street area a smaller car would be more appropriate also.
(-) Chris Hoffman
- He lives on Lake Street
- This project should be similar in size as the one that just went up at the corner.
- He would like to have the Commission preserve the quality of life for himself and his neighbors.
(-) Dan Cheetnam
- He is an architect and lives on Lake Street.
- He has also owned a home before and did construction to the house but did not change the envelope so drastically.
- It is not much to ask to have the volume of the house be minimized.
- He asks that the Commission modify the plans.
(-) Eric Reyes
- He was here a few years ago when the house was going to be demolished.
- Any potential buyer was told that if they wanted to do any type of remodeling and it was outside the character of the neighborhood, the neighborhood would oppose.
- If the family wanted a larger house, there was no need to purchase this particular house.
- The people proposing the construction are not developers but it still requires the approval of the neighborhood.
(-) Gina Morimoto-Reyes
- She lived on Lake Street from 1969 until a few years ago when she got married.
- One of the special things about San Francisco is that although it's a big City, it is also a small town because everyone knows each other.
- The neighborhood has fought hard to keep the integrity of the neighborhood and to save this house.
- Even though she doesn't live in the neighborhood, there is something special about the neighborhood and about this house.
(-) Bill Iracki
- He lives on 17th Avenue
- Many neighborhoods have fought these monster homes.
- It is more economic to make alterations without changing the envelope.
- He feels the economics are against this project.
(+) Kenneth Liu – Project Sponsor
- They purchased this house two years ago since this was a house they could afford at that time.  They are not wealthy.
- This is not the biggest house on the block.  They have been very generous on the setbacks.
- The house is the smallest house on the block.
- They have been waiting very patiently
(+) Monique Ann Liu
- There are many people who oppose this house.
- When they purchased the house, this was one they could afford when they got married and thought it would be great for starting a home.
- The houses on Lake Street are very expensive.
- They would like to have the opportunity to have 3 or 4 children and be able to have her parents live with them.  This is their Chinese culture.
- They have been very open to the design of the home.
(+) Jason Chan – Project Architect
- At the beginning of the project, they did a thorough study of the adjacent buildings.
- They have tried to do everything possible to accommodate the neighbor's concerns.
- They have not been very successful in getting the neighbors to agree with the design.
- They have worked really hard to deal with neighbors' issues.
ACTION:          Continued to September 20, 2001 in order to provide more information on how this project differs from the previous ruling of March 20, 1998.
