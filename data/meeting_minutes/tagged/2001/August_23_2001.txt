B.          COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
8.          Commission Matters
                    Commissioner Salinas:
                    Re:  Status of Affordable Housing Projects
                    He would like to know what the status is on the affordable housing projects that are on the drawing board.  He would like to have a time frame for these projects being completed.
                    The Director responded that information would be provided to the Commissioners in their packets for the hearing of September 6, 2001.
                    Commissioner Baltimore:
                    Re:  Approved below market rate units
                    She had requested information on the number of units the Commission has approved in the below market rate (at 80%, 100% and 120% of meadian income levels).
                    The Planning Director will schedule a presentation on September 6, 2001.
                    Commissioner Theoharis:
                    Re:  Resolution from Supervisor Leno
                    Commissioner Chinchilla brought up the recent resolution from Supervisor Leno urging the Commission not to approve residential housing projects of 10 units of more with less than a 10% or 15% affordability.  The resolution stated that despite the guidelines, the Commission continues to approve projects that require far less than 10% affordability.  Supervisor Leno has made the correction to this legislation.  She also remembers that this legislation was put forward in the year 2000 and then withdrawn.  She would like the Director to include this information in the report he will be giving on September 6, 2001.
                    Re:  Continuances
                    She would like to let the public and developers know that projects cannot be constantly continued.  This makes the calendar get out of hand since sometimes the hearings end at 10:00 p.m. and sometimes at 3:00 p.m.  She would like the Commission Secretary to keep watch on the cases that are requested to be continued and make sure that the developers and the public know that even though there was a request for continuance, it does not mean that it will be granted.
                    Commissioner Lim:
                    Re:  Commending Planning Department Staff
                    She wants to commend the Planning staff on their very professional work.
                    Commissioner Chinchilla:
                    He would like each commissioner to receive the PAC's Revitalization Concept Plan for Bay View Hunter's Point.  
                    The Planning Director stated that he would be in contract with the Redevelopment Agency and provide the Commissioner's with their copy.
C.          DIRECTOR'S REPORT
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
9.          Director's Announcements
                    - The Planning Director will report on items brought up during Commissioner Matters on September 6, 2001.
                    Zoning Administrator:
                    Re:  Demolition Policies
                    - The Department now operates under a memo that the ZA issued as a policy in 1998.  This policy needs to be revisited because there have been a number of demolitions.  He has been working with the Department of Building Inspection to develop a policy.
                    Commissioner Lim:  Would it be a possibility for the Building Department to do a thorough inspection of homes that are to be demolished?  She would like to have colored pictures of these site visits.
                    The ZA stated that he would take this into consideration when he meets with inspectors of DBI.

10.          Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
                    BOS
                    RE:  Appeal of the Environmental Impact Report for the New De Young Museum.
                    - The Director along with Paul Maltzer attended the Board of Supervisor's hearing.  The EIR will go back to the project sponsor's consultant to provide accurate and sufficient date.  They will have to modify slightly the historical content in this report.  He expects that this will be brought back to the Commission at a hearing during the later part of September.  
                    BOA:
                    1432-34 Kearny Street – Discretionary Review in 1997 or 1998.  This DR was withdrawn but then resubmitted.  The issues were regarding underpinning.  The Board denied this permit.  This project was resubmitted without underpinning.  The ZA stated that this was the same project and it did not require a 311 notice.  This decision was appealed at the Board of Appeals last night.  The Board determined that a 311 notice was required and requested that this project be brought to the Commission.

                    Preliminary Recommendation:  Uphold Preliminary Negative Declaration
                    (Continued from Regular Meeting of July 19, 2001)
SPEAKER(S):
(-) John Andrews
- This project does not conform to the character of the neighborhood since it is much larger and bigger than the other buildings.
- Most of the homes in this neighborhood are single-family homes.
- Traffic in the neighborhood will increase substantially which will cause a variety of environmental problems.
(-) David Hooper
- He lives near the proposed project.
- He does not support the environmental report since there are many buildings that come close to the height of the proposed project.
- This project will increase the demand on automobiles.  He does not believe that people will only have one car per unit.
- The traffic will become denser.
- Does this project have to be 4 stories high?
(+) Marcelle Arcilion
- He lives within a block of the project site.  If he were to choose between a mechanic shop or a residential building, he would choose a residential building because he is concerned about chemical exposure.
- He is in full support of the project that allows people to move into these units.
(+) Jim Reuben – Reuben and Alter – Representing Project Sponsor
- He thinks that the department did a great job on all the aspects of the environmental impact and has addressed all of the concerns.

The property is located in a RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District and 40-X Height and Bulk District.  
                    Preliminary Recommendation: Disapproval
                    (Continued from Regular Meeting of July 26, 2001)
                    Note: On July 26, 2001, following public testimony, the Commission closed public hearing and continued the case to August 9, 2001 to allow the project architect to submit revised architectural drawings and to have a representative from the Building Department attend the hearing.  The Vote was +6 –0.  Commissioner Theoharis was absent.
                    SPEAKER(S):
                    (+) Michael Levit – Project Architect
                    - Under conditional use a structure is allowed to be built on this lot without the lot subdivision, which would be the same size structure of the same width.  Because of the additional width of the existing lot, there is enough square footage to accommodate three units.
                    - This project has gone through many reductions in scale.  He has tried to respond to the department's issues and surrounding neighbors.  There are many neighbors in support of the project.
                    - He displayed diagrams that showed the design of the project.
                    (+) Denny Andyelkduci
                    - He has seen the plans and was given an explanation by the project sponsor of the details of the project.
                    - He believes that this will improve the neighborhood.

                    - She lives across the street from the property and it will benefit her to have an improved building across the street.

                    - He and the architect have been working very hard on this project.
                    - He has reached anybody who has showed interest in this project.
                    - There is no way to completely satisfy everyone who has concerns about this project.
                    - This project will be very compatible with the neighborhood.
                    - They have done many revisions to the project, taking into consideration all the issues the neighbors have had.
                    (+) Joe O'Donaghue
                    - This project is two units and staff recommendeds disapproval.
                    - The project sponsor is not a developer.
                    - This homeowner has invested into this project and should be allowed to go through with it.
                    - The Planning Department needs to approve project (like this), which are beneficial to the needs of today.
                    (-) Salem Muffarreh
                    - There are many homeowners here that are against the project.

                    - Her concern is related to privacy.
                    (-) Oscar Tagle
                    - He lives on Diamond Street
                    - He had supported the project in the beginning since it was initially designed as a 3 story home.  Now the design has changed to a 4-story home and he does not agree with this.
                    (-) Norberto Melendez
                    - He lives near the proposed project.
                    - There is no need to maximize projects to their maximum height and width.
                    - If there are any neighbors supporting this project it is because they live across the street.  There are other neighbors in the back part of the building, which do not support it.
                    - His concerns are related to the building height and mass and loss of privacy.
                    (-) Phillip Platt
                    - Twenty-Fifth Street is 1 story below the level of Clipper Street.
                    - His bedroom is below the height of the existing building.
                    - Many of the trees, which are already there, will be removed.
                    - This project is not compatible with the neighborhood.
                    (-) Jerry Polon
                    - He lives on 25th Street.
                    - He did not receive a notice regarding this hearing.  He found out about this from a neighbor.
                    - He does not support this project.

                    Preliminary Recommendation:  Approval with Conditions
                    (Continued from Regular Meeting of August 2, 2001)
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Joe Conte – Project Sponsor
- He has the following three requests:  1) build a rear patio to accommodate more guests; 2) build a functional area to handle the amount of garbage they generate since their current recycling program requires 5 different garbage containers, the recycling program does not allow plastic bags so they also need cemented space with a drain to wash out their garbage containers; 3) they will be required by the fire department and the Building Department to upgrade an exit and install a sprinkler system to the whole building.
- He has had various conversations with the neighbors but only recently have these meetings been productive.
- He is willing to design the space requested with all the conditions that are required of him.
- The project will cost $200,000.  In order to be able to pay for all these upgrades, he needs to have the hours be less restrictive.
- The following conditions are in addition to the ones requested by the Planning Department:  1) all conditions stated in the already existing  Noise Reduction Plan ; 2) small tables seating 2 to 4 people each; 3) add a roof to the garbage area (subject to Building Department approval); 4) low lighting; 5) no music; 6) close patio at 10:00 p.m.; 7) no bar; 8) no smoking; 9) will not be used for a standing or waiting area; 10) no private parties or banquet events; 11) rat slab will be built under the deck; 12) sound proof back wall; 13) the awning will remain closed after 8:00 p.m.; 14) remove fireplace from proposal; 15) add the following noise reduction recommendations resulting from a meeting with a neighborhood representative named Dana Campini and a sound engineer.
- He realizes that these extra conditions will probably take an extra effort but he is willing to do this in order to keep his restaurant open.
(-) Tina Dahl
- She is a resident on Landers Street.
- She handed a petition with signatures of people who are opposed to the construction.
- Parking is greatly impacted by the increase of people coming into the neighborhood.
- In the morning she can see about 10 empty spaces of cars that were parked there attending the restaurant.
- Most of the buildings are three stories and the noise disturbs most of the neighbors.
- She would like for the Commission to not be lenient.
- They are concerned that the entire leniency that the restaurant owner is showing is just to get the project approved but they won't stick to the requirements.
