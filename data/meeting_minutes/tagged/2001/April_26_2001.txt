Commission Matters


 
Commissioner Theoharis:


She received a letter from the Union Square Business Improvement 
      District.
 
There have been a lot of complaints about a 
      mesh signage at the construction site of the French Connection (Ellis and 
      Powell).
 
She would like to know 
      if the mesh is there as signage or to protect the public from the construction.
 
She would like to have a report at the May 
      10, 2001 hearing.
 
There is also 
      a trademark issue but this is not part of the jurisdiction of the Commission.

Turk 
      Street
 - Appeal 
      of Preliminary Negative Declaration: 
The proposed project would construct 
      a mixed-use building on the southeast corner of Turk and Taylor Streets. 
      The proposed building would be approximately 96,984 gross square feet (gsf), 
      accommodating 12,432 gsf of mechanical and maintenance space in the basement 
      floor; 7,207 gsf of retail on the ground floor; 40,484 gsf of parking on 
      floors 2-4; and 36,861 gsf of office on floors 5-7. The tenant-parking garage 
      would provide 76 parking spaces, without any loading spaces. The building 
      would be 106 feet tall. Vehicular site access to the proposed parking garage 
      would be from Taylor Street. Pedestrian street-level site access to the 
      retail and office spaces would be from Turk Street. The existing 84 parking 
      spaces on a surface- and basement-level garage would be demolished. The 
      project site, approximately 12,940 sf, is on Assessor's Block 0342 and Lot 
      011, in a C-3-G Zoning District and a 120-X Height and Bulk District.

SPEAKER(S):




Comments on Continuance:




Andrew Junius




- Ms. Hestor has requested a continuance based on the fact that she 
      did not receive a case report.
 
Ms. 
      Hestor is aware that the material is available at the Planning Department 
      a week before the hearing.
 
She could 
      have also called the planner and asked for a case report.






- They are not in agreement to the continuance.




Sue Hestor




- The parties are supposed to be mailed a brief.




- This is sloppy work from the planner




- She is ready to have the hearing since the item will not be continued.





       
      




 
SPEAKER(S):


 
(-) Sue Hestor – Appellant (representing 
      various Tenderloin residents)


 
- One of the biggest problems is the way staff 
      summarized their issues.


 
- The issues are that when there are loading 
      activities not only is the parking lane occupied but also the traffic lane--either 
      because there are vehicles double-parked or because there are items being 
      brought into the theatre. 


 
- There is a lost traffic lane on the east side 
      of Taylor Street.


 
- When people get off the freeway and go down 
      6
th
 Street towards Market, because it's a strange intersection, 
      there are many cars that are involved.


 
- There is a big jumble of traffic mess.


 
- All they are asking is for staff to do an 
      analysis of traffic on Turk Street.


 
- They want an honest analysis of the traffic 
      patterns.


 
(-) David Baker 


 
- He is a long time resident of the Tenderloin.


He lives a block from the proposed site.


 
- This area has suffered from traffic problems 
      for many years.


 
- There should be an analysis done of what counts 
      and what is important:
 
is it pedestrians, 
      the public, etc.


 
- He is not asking much.
 
An entrance on Turk Street instead of an entrance 
      on Taylor Street should be considered.


 
(-) Brother Collins


 
- There is a lot of chaos on Taylor Street.


 
- During the mornings, there are cars double-parked 
      at a grocery store.
 
The Orpheum 
      Theatre has traffic that double parks as well.


 
- He sometimes has to jaywalk because of so 
      much traffic.


 
- He is not in disagreement of the project.


He would just like to have a traffic analysis done or just have the 
      entrance moved.
 
The design could be improved as well.


 
- He challenges the parking study.
 
He has been living and working in the neighborhood 
      for many years and the results of the study are not what he sees.


 
- His organization has had to find parking for 
      their six cars, which becomes quite difficult.
 
St. Anthony's Foundation has had to look for parking of their four 
      cars as well.


 
(-) Ernestine Weiss


 
- She travels on the No. 33 bus.
 
The streets in the neighborhood are not wide 
      and they are very dangerous.


 
- She would like to have the entrance of this 
      building on Turk Street.


 
- Parking garages should be built underground.


 
(+) Andrew Junius – Reuben and Alter – Representative 
      of Project Sponsor


 
- The negative declaration was based on the 
      requirements of CEQA.


 
- The project has no significant effects on 
      the environment.


 
- CEQA requires that a project be focused on 
      the project.
 
None of the statements 
      made at this hearing have to do with the environment.


 
- The Turk Street entrance would cause more 
      significant problems.


 
- The impacts on the project state that the 
      transportation studies during peak hours are worse.


 
- He spoke to one of the managers of the Orpheum 
      Theatre and also looked in the Pink Section of the Chronicle and in the 
      next month there will only be 5 shows at the theatre.
 
When an analysis could be done is not certain since there will not 
      be many shows in the next month.


 
- He is available for questions.

- He recalls 
      that the public hearing is closed except for the open space.


 
- He heard 
      the Commission's concerns and talked to representatives of the Chinatown 
      Economic Development Group.


 
- They have 
      spent some time upgrading the rooftop open space recognizing that it's highly 
      unlikely that they will build this open space if the variance is not granted.


 
- He is available 
      to show photos of this open space to the Commission.


 
(-) Ernestine 
      Weiss


 
- Their neighbors, 
      Golden Gateway Center, never received notice of this hotel going up.


Several members passed by the Yank Sing restaurant and saw a notice 
      that a hearing had been held.
 
These members were not able to come to that 
      hearing since they did not know about it.


 
- There is 
      an over supply of hotels, the economy is down so there is no need for a 
      hotel at this time.
 
Housing, housing, 
      housing is the most important issue now.

Request for Conditional-Use Authorization under

      antennae to be mounted inside the top of a new flagpole to be located at

      of a wireless communication network in an SLI (Service/Light Industrial) 
      Zoning District and 50-X Height and Bulk District.


The Project Site meets Location Preference Number 4 (Preferred Location 
      Site) of the Wireless Telecommunications Services (WTS) Facilities Siting 
      Guidelines, as it is within an industrial structure.


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
Approval with conditions





       
      




 
SPEAKER(S):


 
(+) Robert 
      Krebs – Representing Project Sponsor


 
- This site 
      complies with the WTS Sighting Guidelines and the San Francisco Municipal 
      Code.


 
- Three antennas 
      would be installed in a flagpole and screened from view.


 
- This is 
      an important site to provide better service for this area.


 
- They looked 
      at other locations but none were feasible.
 
Many sites were vacant sites and it would not be appropriate to 
      just have a flagpole on a vacant site.


 
- A community 
      meeting was held and no one attended the meeting.
 
The notice for the meeting was sent out to 
      various residents and property owners in various languages.

SPEAKER(S):




(+) David Silverman – Reuben and Alter – Representing Project 
      Sponsor




- He submitted revised parking information.




- He is available for questions.




(-) Max Schmeder




- He has been living on this block since 1981.




- The one-story project will create a lot of traffic problems.




- The concerns they have are regarding expanding--adding spaces to 
      the plan.
 
He referenced a diagram of the parking issue.




- The spaces are not big enough and there aren't enough of them.




- Under regulations, businesses have overnight caretakers.
 
If they moved into these units it would become 
      a residential building and would still cause parking problems.




- A four-unit residential building should be considered.




(-) Dick Millet – Potrero Boosters Neighborhood Association




- The attorney for the project sponsor sent him the revised parking 
      information.
 
At first he didn't 
      have a problem but now he does.




- Parking does not work.
 
It 
      will be difficult to get a car in and cars out.




- He recommends taking a bathroom and moving it next to the men's 
      bathroom and moving the wet bar into the office.


This would give five more feet.




(-) Elena Myers




- One of the very large businesses on the block has created a lot 
      of problems because they have huge trucks coming and going.




- They have acknowledged that this is a residential neighborhood.




- The Commission needs to look at this as a residential project.




- There are already lofts on the block.




- This project needs to have four parking spaces.
 
There aren't enough street spaces to accommodate all the cars.




- Two cars per unit should be considered.

SPEAKER(S):


 
(-) Harold Wright – Forest Hill Neighborhood 
      Association (FHNA)


 
- There are new homes and extensive additions 
      without any problems.


 
- Many of the better homes are built on large 
      lots.


 
- This is the first time that anyone would like 
      to demolish his or her home to subdivide the lot.


 
- They wouldn't object to a subdivision of a 
      vacant lot.
 
They are opposed to 
      demolishing a home just for subdividing a lot.


 
- Since the lot is steep the back yard is unusable.


 
- The current owners have not maintained the 
      house for 14 years.
 
The paint is 
      peeling and the garden is uncared for.


 
- The owners want to demolish the most interesting 
      part of the front faÃ§ade.


 
- The garage is proposed to be moved and subdivide 
      the house at the left side of a gate.


 
- The owners have conveniently decided that 
      only the left side of the house is architecturally significant.


 
- Their directors (FHNA) voted to not approve 
      the demolition but construct an addition to the house instead.


 
- There are not that many neighbors that approve 
      the demolition.
 
They would rather 
      have the house preserved.


 
(-) Kay Yanemoto – Secretary of the Forest 
      Hill Neighborhood Association


 
- 
She strongly 
      opposes the demolition of this house.


 
- The organization has held public meetings 
      and everyone was invited to attend.


 
- This project is bad for Forest Hill and she 
      asks the Commission to oppose it.


 
(-) Gaile Robbins


 
- The traffic would be increased in the neighborhood 
      since 2 homes will be added.


 
(-) Radolf Scott


 
- He lives on San Marcos Street.


 
- This street is a split-level street.


 
- He feels very strongly about preserving the 
      character of the neighborhood.


 
- He was approached by Dr. Kelly soliciting 
      his approval and endorsement of the project.


Nowhere does it clearly state what the approach will be.


 
(-) Tom Grassof


 
- He is opposed to this project because it will 
      increase traffic on the street since it is a small street.





       
      




 
(+) John Sanger – Sanger and Olsen – Representing 
      Project Sponsor


 
- This project would demolish a large portion 
      of the house and subdivide the lot.


 
- This opposition is only for the subdivision 
      and not if the project follows the residential design guidelines.


 
- When the project sponsor purchased the home 
      they were notified that there were two lots they were purchasing.


 
- The construction will be in conformance to 
      the residential design guidelines and it will not cause blockage of light 
      and air.


 
- There is no basis to take DR.
 
There is nothing in any of the plan remodeling 
      which will be in conflict with the residential design guidelines.


 
(+) Albert Lanier – Project Architect


 
- They have never had any problems with DR's 
      and especially in Forest Hill.


 
- Various neighbors are in agreement with this 
      home.


 
- The garage was severely damaged in the 1989 
      Loma Prieta earthquake.


 
- The project sponsors really like the house.


 
- They intend to respect every design feature, 
      which has been done.


 
- He would like the Commission to deny this 
      Discretionary Review and approve the project.


 
 
(+) 
      Dr. Kelly


 
- He and his wife own the house on San Marcos 
      Street--which is the subject property.


 
- It is difficult for him to speak about the 
      exaggerations of the Forest Hill Association.


 
- The lot was originally two lots.


 
 
- Has 
      been waiting and waiting to receive notice from the neighborhood association 
      to attend their meeting.


 
- He received a call from the Association and 
      they stated that they had already met and were in disagreement with his 
      project.

The Planning

      per Planning Commission's decision.





       
      






SPEAKER(S):




(-) Michael Dolan




- He lives next door to the proposed construction.




- He passed out a letter from the FBI




- The Declaration of Independence reads that everyone has the right 
      to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.




- If the proposed construction goes ahead, it would mean the devaluation 
      of his property where he has lived for the past 42 years.




- He was not notified of the hearing in January.




- He submitted the letter he read to the Commission.




(+) Mr. Edwin Yuen




- He is here to follow guidelines from the previous hearing.




- The addition is up to code.
 
He 
      and the architect spoke to staff in order to know what is allowed by the 
      code.




- They have lived in this house for three generations.
 
It has been a long two years and hopes that it will end today.

- He owns a real estate company.


He is here to speak in support of this proposal.




- Mr. Yuen has responded to the exact details of the proposal from

- He likes the area a lot.




- Mr. Yuen has shown courtesy and kindness to his neighbors and has 
      tried to make more than a sufficient effort to mitigate the neighbors' concerns.




- He hopes the Commission won't put Mr. Yuen to more aggravation. 
      




(+) Nelson Li




- He is 13 years old and shares the same room with his grandparents.




- He would like to have his own room.

      Yuen.
 
She is here to speak on behalf 
      of Susie Yen who is a neighbor that could not attend the hearing but wrote 
      a letter in support of the project.




- She also hopes that the Commission approves the project.




(+) Betsy Ho




- She lives on 29
th
 Avenue, one block from the proposed 
      project.




- She is here to show support of the project and to her neighbors.




- As a property owner everyone has the right to build on his or her 
      property.




(+) Roger Nottingham




- It is a really strange situation when a man originally wants to 
      build in the back so he designs a tiny addition on top of his house and 
      then the Commission approves to build in the back again.




- There has to be a limit to this and he hopes the Commission will 
      approve the project.




(-) Jeff Rogers




- He lives next door to the proposed site.




- Previous speakers have stated that the extension is six feet.
 
There are a lot of misunderstandings.
 
The Yuen's house is already 50% larger than 
      any of the other houses in the neighborhood.




- An addition is ok with the neighbors but a reasonable addition 
      is all he asks for.




- A massive addition should not be allowed.


If this addition is approved, they will go through the process of 
      appeals.




(-) Steve Williams




- After the hearing in January of this year, he thought that they 
      had an agreement.




- Jeff Rogers retained him some time ago.




- He wished that there was more time to look at the design.
 




- Two full stories would be a negative impact on the neighbors.




- There is no encroachment on the open space.




- This whole area will become a battleground unless there is a compromise.




- He would request that the second story be eliminated.




(-) Queta Rogers




- She understands that the project sponsor needs to expand.




- They are willing to accept an addition that is within the law.




(-) Michael Mourese Dolan




- He spoke at the January meeting.




- Michael Glesoff gave an address on Noriega Street that is his work 
      address not his home address.




- This addition is outside of the scope of the surrounding properties.
 
The project sponsor has a large home and many 
      people live there.




- There is a bedroom that will be added behind the garage.




- There is a laundry area in the plans.




- He is a licensed real estate broker and was born and raised in

SPEAKER(S):


 
(-) Steven Ma


 
- He is a homeowner on 45
th

- He spoke to Mr. Samuels over the phone once and met once at the 
      community board.
 
He has tried to 
      resolve their differences but hasn't been able to.


That's why they are here.


 
- He gathered over 80 signatures of neighbors 
      against this project.




- The construction would not follow the neighborhood characteristics.
 
It will be considered an eyesore.




- A two-story building would be more appropriate.
 
This construction would cast a shadow over his neighbor's property.




- Parking and traffic are issues as well.


If adequate parking does not exist or can't be provided, this proposal 
      should not be constructed.




- The proposed house was built since the 1900s.




- He would like Mr. Samuels to lower the proposed construction.




- There are no 4
th
 story homes in the neighborhood.


 
(-) Tim Hittle




- He and his fiancÃ© own a home on 45
th
 Avenue.




- If this house is built they will significantly lose the view they 
      have of the ocean and the western sky.


They have established an organic garden, which would be affected.




- The proposed structure is larger than a billboard near their house.




- They will lose both light and air with this new construction.


 
(-) Michael Lother


 
- He lives directly across from the proposed 
      structure.


 
- He has lived in his house since 1952.


 
- As time goes by he has seen how the original 
      style of cottages is all but gone now.


 
- He talked to Steve about the actual proposal 
      and objected more because the construction will be right in his face.


 
- The corner services two major bus lines (18 
      and 71).


 
- There are just no parking spaces after 7:00 
      p.m in this neighborhood.


 
- The 4

- He has lived on 48

He is really familiar

- This house deserves to be saved.
 
This house could sell for less than $300,000.


 
- Apartments will be built here--not condominiums.


There are no other four stories in the area.


The vast majority of the structures are original two stories.


 
- The least that could be done is to save the 
      house and build on the rest of the property.


 
(+) Lu Blazej – Representing Project Sponsor


 
- This is the first time the Commission is seeing 
      him on a Discretionary Review case.


 
- He took this case because Mr. Samuels, who 
      is the project sponsor, was in distress since he had 9 units he wants to 
      build in San Francisco--some affordable units and small commercial space.


 
- There were some design issues that staff raised 
      but Mr. Blazej worked out these issues.


 
- Displayed an aerial photo of the site.


 
- There is parking available on all streets.


Parking and traffic will not be an issue or a problem.


 
- There will be very little shadow impacts.


 
- There are no parapet or roof appendages.

- He is one of three owners of three separate 
      lots where there will be three separate buildings.


 
- Pattern of development in the Sunset; there 
      are 4-story buildings in the area.
 
For 
      example:
 
22
nd
 and Noriega, 
      22
nd
 and Vicente, 23
rd
 and Vicente, 47
th
 
      and 48
th
 and Judah, etc.


 
- There are many more 4-story buildings in the 
      area.


 
- He passed to the Commissioners two books that 
      have extensive pictures of 4-story buildings in the immediate neighborhoods.


 
- Regarding the parking problems, he believes 
      this is a bogus issue.


 
(+) William Heijn – Project Architect


 
- He doesn't have much to add only that he is 
      available for questions.


 
(-/+) Mario Pilpel


 
- He owns property on Noriega Street.


 
- He is concerned about the historical significance 
      of the property since he used to run a pharmacy across the street from the 
      subject property where in the early 70's a musical group called The Tubes 
      used to practice there.
 
Since then 
      it's been vacant.


 
- He spoke to Mr. Samuels and said that all 
      the neighbors agreed to the project and that is not true.
 
He told Mr. Samuels he did not support the 
      project.


 
- The aerial photos were taken in 1995; in July 
      of 1995 he closed the pharmacy he was operating; there was no traffic being 
      generated by that location until approximately a year later.


 
- What Mr. Blazej mentioned is not a valid conclusion.


 
- On Sunday mornings, it is difficult to park 
      in the area because there is church there.
