B of A: None


 


7.        Presentation on Controller's Office Audit and Department's response.


SPEAKER (s):


(-)  Sue Hestor


 
-
          
    
 Planning Department should get out of the business of handling 
    money.  This department is not set up as a money handling department


 
-
          
    
 Controller's Audit did not identify a problem that she was 
    able to identify--which is the Planning Department staff does not understand 
    the provisions of transit impact fees, which covers not only offices but also 
    business services


-     There are no close-out procedures for files.  The Department needs 
    to close them out and notify the appropriate agencies


 
(-)   Alice Barkley


 
-
          
    
 We do not need to create another Department to solve these 
    problems


 
-
          
    
 The School District does very well.  They do not issue your 
    site permit or your building permit until you pay the fees


 
-
          
    
 Since most impacts do not happened until the building is completed 
    and people moved in, and since DBI is the collecting agcncy, they [DBI] should 
    have within their tickler system a way to know whether or not the fees have 
    been paid before they issue any permits of occupancy or certificate of occupancy 
    whether it is temporary or permanent.


(-)  Phil Donohue


 
-
          
    
 Does seem to him that the Controller's Office is doing a good 
    job, the entire process has been politicized

    Master Plan, for a graduate level management degree program occupying no more 
    than 10,000 square feet of space in an existing office building.


Preliminary Recommendation: The Department recommends that the Planning Commission 
    not hold a public hearing on this request.

San 
    Francisco Federal Office Building


- Informational presentation on the conceptual design of the proposed 
    new Federal Office Building at Seventh and Mission Streets. 


            Preliminary Recommendation: None. 
    Informational only, with no staff endorsement


(THIS ITEM WAS TAKEN OUT OR 
    ORDER AND FOLLOWED ITEM #10.)


SPEAKER (S):


(+)   Maria Ciprazo, GSA


 
-
          
    
 Hopes the Commission will share our enthusiasm for this long 
    waited project


 
-
          
    
 This federal project not only rethinks the office building 
    prototype, but also creates a new place--a destination within the City's fabric


 
-
          
    
 This will become a catalyst for change


 
-
          
    
 The creation of community space that is within the complex 
    is intended to facilitate a critical mass of people to come into the area 
    to make use of not only of the federal services but the facility in and of 
    itself.  It is to enlighten a San Francisco neighborhood that has been lacking 
    a public use space for many years


 
-
          
    
 In July 2000, GSA gained title to the site on 7
th
 
    and Mission.  At this location, we were given an opportunity to showcase our 
    historic 9
th
 Court of Appeals by developing a structure that serves 
    and frames the beauty of the Court House as well as preserves view corridors 
  


 
(+) Tom Mayne, 
    Project Architect


Gave a detail description of the 
    project


(+) Catherine Dodd, District 
    Director for Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi


 
-
          
    
 We are loosing a lot of Federal employees to Oakland and Richmond.  
    We have lost the Social Security Administration, Drug Administration and several 
    others.  We are soon to loose the National Park Service Office from San Francisco 
    because of the high cost of office space and the lack of Federal office building 
    space.


 
-
          
    
 This proposal is a very slender building.


 
-
          
    
 It will reflect the sky and the historic buildings surrounding 
    it.


 
-
          
    
 It would be a very active plaza


-     Embrace this new design


(+) John Anderson, Federal Employee


-    Believed this new plaza would 
    be very nice and very different from United Nations Plaza


-    Would be a very safe place 
    to work


(+/-) Michael Levin-


 
-
          
    
 Ever since he first heard about this many years ago, especially 
    with the jewel building across the street--Old Court of Appeals, and the glorious 
    City Hall, he felt it might be fair to compare our government buildings with 
    the best government buildings in Washington D.C. 


 
-
          
    
 Hoped to see a building that would be complimentary to the 
    glorious Court of Appeals


 
-
          
    
 He is greatly pleased by the large plaza because it affords 
    one a view to the beauty of the Court of Appeals, and because of the open 
    space


 
-
          
    
 He has a problem with the design.  Does not believe it compliments 
    the Court of Appeals in any way.  It is slender from the east-west perspective--that 
    is certainly a plus, but from north and south it is a huge rectangular mass 
    that appears not to blend with the rest of the buildings in the neighborhood


(+) Jim Haas


 
-
          
    
 This building is essential to the east side of the Civic Center 
    and Mid-Market area with the 3000 employees and the agencies that are going 
    to be there


 
-
          
    
 The building should try to connect 7
th
 Street to 
    Civic Center--which has been a goal going back before the 1906 earthquake 
    when the Court of Appeals was built


-     The Federal Government is 
    giving us an opportunity to try something new for a change


-     Have concerns mainly about 
    the plaza


 
-
          
    
 This project will bring thousands of new people to this area. 
    Although it is in a transit corridor, the building itself virtually won't 
    have any parking.    Parking will become a chaos


(-) Lu Blazej


 
-
          
    
 I had seen many projects–private and government projects.  
    It has been a long standing policy that both the Federal and State government, 
    even though they are exempt from local laws and ordinances, respect those 
    law and ordinances.


 
-
          
    
 Clearly the massing and the lay out of this project do not 
    meet the provisions of the Downtown Plan.  The Downtown Plan and the planning 
    process is for the whole City.  The State and Federal government should respect 
    what is [established to guide development] for San Francisco.  


 
-
          
    
 Surprised that GSA came before you with a project that so exceeds 
    what the policy and guidelines are.  It is unbelievable.


-    This is totally disrespectful 
    to what the Planning Code stipulates


 
(-) Robert Meyers


 
-
          
    
 Agreed with the former speaker


 
-
          
    
 We might as well throw the Urban Design Plan and Larry Badiner's 
    Downtown Plan out of the window if this project is approved


 
-
          
    
 Open space and energy conservations are terrific


 
-
          
    
 It is mainly the mass on Market Street.  This mass would create 
    terrible shadows on Market        


Street.

Permanent Industrial Protection Zone
 - Proposed initiation of an amendment to create a 
    Permanent Industrial Protection Zone as a special use district in the industrially-zoned 
    lands within a multi-block area generally bounded by Bayshore Avenue, 26

    Bay, Islais Creek, Third Street, Evans, Rankin, Phelps, Oakdale, Selby, and 
    Helena; and proposal to hold a public hearing on said proposed amendment no 
    less than 20 days following initiation of the amendment.


SPEAKER (S):


(+)  Alice Barkley


 
-
          
    
 Glad to see that the Department is moving forward with this 
    legislations


 
-
          
    
 What the Department has right now, in a way, makes it even 
    more restrictive in some of the IPZ areas than what is being proposed by the 
    Board of Supervisors in terms of housing.


 
-
          
    
 The Department should really look at this map.  Agreed that 
    there are some areas where there should not be any housing at all.  But there 
    are some pockets that at a minimum, the staff should allow non-profit, totally 
    affordable housing to go forward.   Make it double the density for affordability


(+)  Lu Blazej


 
-
          
    
 Glad that this is moving forward 


(+)  Joe O'Donoghue


 
-
          
    
 Good that this is getting concrete planning like this, but 
    unfortunately, this going down the same path.


 
-
          
    
 Unlike in the past, when there was more money available to 
    the Department and the Board of Supervisors had some interest in solving the 
    housing and job issues, we have now constraints on the Department.


 
-
          
    
 One of the problems we have is that the model, which we had 
    set up, is deficient.  We should, as part of the model, when we give the number 
    of the many possible jobs, we should also put a tax dollar increment as revenue 
    to these figures, especially in terms of housing. Because the fact is that 
    job and housing production and property tax revenue is the economy engine 
    that in fact provides 90% of the revenue to this City.


(-)   John Sanger


 
-
          
    
 Unfortunately this is moving forward and no analytical foundation 
    has been establish whatsoever, either on land use analysis or economics for 
    this proposal


 
-
          
    
 It took fifteen years through the 60s and 70s to change the 
    City's zoning and get rid-off of the provisions on housing and mixed use in 
    Industrial districts.


 
-
          
    
 This is been unfairly presented.


 
-
          
    
 This isolated the residents of these areas including the traditional 
    Dogpatch neighborhood which is located immediately adjacent to the Special 
    Use district


 
-
          
    
 A creative approach might be in the form of some variation 
    to the existing interim controls   that bounces between how to deal with vacant 
    land, land that is already occupied by industrial uses of various types, and 
    how to somehow juggle the mixture of uses that have been traditional in San 
    Francisco Zoning.


(-)  Steve Vettel


 
-
          
    
 South of Cesar Chavez is perfectly appropriate


 
-
          
    
 His concern is the north area of Cesar Chavez.  It is a mixed-use 
    area that is currently undergoing community planning as part of the Better 
    Neighborhoods 2000-2002 program in the Central Waterfront Plan.


 
-
          
    
 It seems little precipitous to impose permanent bans on all 
    housing in an area that is undergoing studies under Master Plan policies and 
    the Better Neighborhood 2000-2002 program.


 
-
          
    
 Let this Better Neighborhood process go on in that area.


(+) Stanley Marouca, Redevelopment 
    Agency project manager for the Bayview-Hunters Point

Supports the proposed 
    project that has been presented to the Commission 


(+)  Jim Martin, Economic Development 
    Chairperson for the Project Area Committee (PAC)


 
-
          
    
 Respectfully requested that the Planning Department reconsider 
    the boundaries of the                    proposed perminent Industrial Protection 
    Zone. To exclude from the proposed perminent Industrial Controls the land 
    within Assessor's blocks 4355, 4356, 4357, 4377, 78, 5217, 5226, 5304 and 
    5313.  These blocks are either directly adjacent to 3

    or to the pending MUNI 3
rd

-
          
    
 Focus on capitalizing on the economic development and affordable 
    housing opportunities provided by the lightrail line


 
-
          
    
 Requested that instead of creating a new community plan study 
    area for the Bayview Hunters Point, that the Planning Department and the Commission 
    work with the Bayview Hunters Point Project Area Committee (PAC) and the Redevelopment 
    Agency, because in creating a redevelopment survey in 1995 the Board of Supervisors 
    granted the PAC future planning jurisdiction for all properties line south 
    of Cesar Chavez Boulevard and Highway 101

Community Plan Study Areas and Policies and 
    Procedures in Some Industrial Lands
 - Proposed resolution establishing 
    four community plan study areas encompassing the industrially-zoned lands 
    in the South of Market, Showplace Square/Lower Porter Hill area, Bay view/Hunters 
    Point, and the area of the Mission District generally bounded by the Central 
    Freeway, Porter Avenue, Cesar Chavez, and Guerrero; and establishing policies 
    and procedures for development proposals in some industrially-zoned lands 
    within the four proposed community plan study areas and the Central Waterfront.


SPEAKER (S):


(-)  Alice Barkley


 
-
          
    
 I think this needs to be clarified. 


 
-
          
    
 Secondly, you referred back to resolution 18461, the department 
    staff under Mr. Ghosh has got to stop referring and putting layers and layers 
    of resolutions, one on top of another.


(-)  Quentin Maeck


 
-
          
    
 In the current zoning of South of Market, the SSO is the only 
    area where office development is allowed.


 
-
          
    
 Early this year we requested through Supervisor McGoldrick's 
    office and Supervisor Daly's office a list of business services in the SOMA.  
    We received that list and are currently in the process of researching the 
    available space that now stands vacant and cannot be used for anything else.  
    Mr. Badiner had indicated that he will not be issuing any more termination 
    of business services.


(-)   Bob Meyers


 
-
          
    
 Pointed out that in the SLI district one of the goals presented 
    today was to encourage and maximize housing in the SOMA.  The SLI district 
    which occupied one half of the entire SOMA has a restriction in it--while 
    it permits housing by conditional use, the only housing that is permitted 
    there is low income housing.  Since this plan was adopted in 1989, outside 
    the redevelopment area no low-income housing has been produced.  If we want 
    affordable housing in the SOMA, it has to be associated with market rate housing


 
-
          
    
 Urged that market rate housing through conditional use (in 
    order to generate the desirable affordable housing) be considered through 
    our planning process for the SLI and other districts.


(-)  Jim Martin, Economic Development 
    Chairperson for the Project Area Committee (PAC

 We need to find ways to encourage neighborhood serving, neighborhood 
    building development in SOMA


(-)   Joe O'Donoghue


 
-
          
    
 In the past there have been a lot of documents produced by 
    this Department, and nothing ever happened.  For example, the live work. Reports 
    like this came out; we were supposed to build 10,000 live work units in the 
    SOMA.  That never happened because halfway through the process you get the 
    protestors.  You get the self interest groups.  And the protestors this time 
    came from the outside, not from the people generally around the area, as this 
    Commission very well knows


ACTION
:            No action.  
    This matter will be continued at future hearings.

Development
 - Public
 Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Report
:  
    Assessor's Block 269, Lots 2, 2a, 3, 22, 24, 25, 26, which is the approximate 
    middle third of the Block between Bush, Pine, Kearny and Montgomery Streets.  
    The proposed project which would have frontages on both Bush and Pine Streets 
    would be a 250-foot-high (19 stories), 400,000 sq.ft. office building that 
    would incorporate the historical San Francisco Mining Exchange Building (San 
    Francisco Landmark No. 113).  The proposed office tower would be set back 
    from the Bush Street faÃ§ade of the Mining Exchange Building.  The project 
    as proposed would contain 360,000 sq.ft. of office use, 7,270 sq.ft. of retail 
    use and 32,730 sq.ft. of parking as 100 subsurface parking spaces.  Four existing 
    buildings (465-469 Pine, 451-453 Pine, 447 Pine, and 441-443 Pine) would be 
    demolished.  The project site is located in the Financial District of downtown 
    San Francisco in the C-3-O Zoning District and 250-S Height and Bulk District. 
  


Note: Written comments will be received at 
    the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m. on July 5, 2001.


Preliminary Recommendation:  No action required.

 Concerned about the mass of the building 


 
-
          
    
 EIR is lacking in graphics and photographs, this was something 
    the Landmarks Board members brought up


 
-
          
    
 There are not any photos of the interior of the Mining Exchange 
    Building, and this is a Landmark.  The architect expressed various aspects 
    on what they plan to do to preserve it.  This should be part of the EIR.


 
-
          
    
 Building has been vacated for many years and glad to see a 
    proposal that would energize it


 
-
          
    
 Photos were very interesting but not useful.  For example, 
    the photos in the EIR showed a drawing of the building that is significantly 
    different from what the actual building may appear to be.

845 
    Vienna Street 
– Request for Conditional Use authorization to allow 
    expansion of an existing private elementary school at 845 Vienna Street (School 
    of the Epiphany), under Planning Code Section 209.3(g).  The proposal is to 
    demolish an existing one-story converted church building, which houses the 
    present gymnasium and construct a new two-story building, approximately 13,800 
    square feet at the northeast corner of the school site.   The property is 
    located within a RH-1 (Residential, House, One-Family) District and a 40-X 
    Height and Bulk District.  


Preliminary Recommendation: 
    Approval with conditions.  


SPEAKER (S):


Monsignor Bruce Rayer


 
-
          
    
 The project before you has been a dream for the last five years


 
-
          
    
 The existing school building that we have now it just inadequate 
    to meet the needs of the 600 students we have right now in our program.


 
-
          
    
 We were planning originally to put this building on top of 
    the school, but we encountered some real problems in developing that because 
    the roof is wood, we had to put in a concrete floor, and the concrete floor 
    triggered retrofitting of the entire building


 
-
          
    
 Our original church was built in 1911.  It has been moved a 
    coupled of times in our neighborhood.  It has been our gymnasium since 1951.


 
-
          
    
 Made a reference to Condition #5:  This conditions states that 
    the new two-story building, that is part of the School of the Epiphany should 
    be used only by the school and should not be rented out for outside events 
    or used for non-school related events.  He believes that this is a very narrow 
    sentence.  First of all, our facilities are not available for rent.  We do 
    not rent to any outside group.


ACTION
:            Approved 
    as amended:


 
The new two-story building 
    that is part of School of the Epiphany shall be used only by the school and 
    shall not be rented out for outside events or used for non-school 
and non-parish 
    
related events.

-
          
    
 Lived in the neighborhood for many years


 
-
          
    
 Surprised by the size of the project


 
-
          
    
 Concerned about the space between the two residences


 
-
          
    
 Windows are the only resource of light to the laundry room 
    and kitchen


 
-
          
    
 Will be deprive of light and ventilation


 
-
          
    
 Concerned about the noise coming from the other house


 
-
          
    
 There is also a fire hazard because of the closeness of the 
    properties


 
-
          
    
 Over all the project is too massive and parking will create 
    an impact in the neighborhood


(+) Paul Curtis


 
-
          
    
 Lives very close to the proposed project


 
-
          
    
 This proposal would impact the character of the neighborhood


 
-
          
    
 There are no fourth floor buildings on Chennery Street


 
-
          
    
 Would block enormously the only sunlight that comes into this 
    house


 
-
          
    
 It is out of context with the rest of the neighborhood


 
-
          
    
 Commission should impose the removal of the fourth floor as 
    one of the conditions of approval.


(+) Mary Ann Wurly-Deignan


 
-
          
    
 Has lived in the area for 80 years


 
-
          
    
 His mother spends most of her time in the kitchen since she 
    retired because it is the sunnyest room in the whole house


 
-
          
    
 With this new proposed project, his mother will not be able 
    to enjoy the little bit of sunlight that she has in her house


 
-
          
    
 This will be detrimental to his mother's health as well as 
    the property value of the house


 
-
          
    
 The rooftop is unacceptable.  It would violate their privacy.


(-) Charles Karl, Architect


-   Gave a description of the project


ACTION
:  Take Discretionary Review and approve project with modifications:


 
               (1) Obtain demolition clearance 
    before approving any building permits to demolish and reconstruct a building 
    on the subject property;


 
 
    (2) Reduce the 12-foot permitted obstruction at the rear of the property from 
    three (3) to two (2) stories to comply with the Residential Design Guidelines 
    to respect rear yards and open space;


 
 
    (3) Eliminate the proposed fourth story completely to reduce the mass and 
    scale of the building and to be more consistent with the established two and 
    three-story development pattern on the block and in the surrounding neighborhood;   
    


 
 
    (4) Eliminate the roof deck completely to further negate the need for any 
    additional structures (stair tower and railing) protruding vertically from 
    the proposed building envelop.  However, should the roof deck be allowed and 
    access to and from the roof area is required, then propose a stair penthouse 
    of a minimal size instead of a spiral stair tower that is so grandiose in 
    design.  Furthermore, the stair penthouse should be located where it does 
    not negatively impact the adjacent neighboring property to the west and is 
    not so visually dominating from the street;


 
 
    (5) Increase the building separation between the subject and the adjacent 
    building to the west from three (3) to a minimum of four (4) feet;  


 
 (6) Modify or remove all horizontal and vertical projections 
    located along the west side setback area, including the stair tower and two 
    (2) chimneys to minimize negative impacts on light, air, and privacy to the 
    DR requestor’s property line windows

-
          
    
 This has been done fast to avoid any additional process


 
-
          
    
 Project would have 52 windows.  32 of those windows would be 
    looking into every room in our house--into our private airwell, deck and garden.


 
-
          
    
 This is a house with no regard to neighborhood context and 
    neighbors

Preliminary Recommendation: 
    Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project as proposed.     
  


SPEAKER (S):


(+)  Melvin Seraca, DR requestor


-     This is one the oldest residential 
    buildings in the City 


-     Project was built contrary 
    to plans


-     Do not authorize the 4
th
 
    floor addition


(+)  Shirley Bentley


 
-
          
    
 Does not support project


 
-
          
    
 This is the first demolition in the Telegraph Hill Historic 
    District since its designation–which was very controversial. The plans which 
    became part of the approved certificate of appropriateness, memorialized the 
    specific set of compromises and agreements between the developers, the Telegraph 
    Hills Dwellers and the adjoining neighbors to resolve substantial controversies 
    concerning the building envelope and height--specifically including the impact 
    on the adjacent land locked historic cottages at 1334 Montgomery Street


(-)   John Lutrell


 
-
          
    
 The balcony has to come off 


 
-
          
    
 There are a series of maneuvers or actions that the developer 
    has taken that are not in conformity with the original Cetificate of Apropriateness


 
-
          
    
 This can only be interpreted as an intentional departure [from 
    the agreements]


 
-
          
    
 [If the agreements were kept,] the original height would be 
    exactly what it should be, without going up 2 feet, 3 inches further


(+)  Nancy Shanahan


 
-
          
    
 Windows and doors, except for the garage and front doors, were 
    prefabricated vinyl, instead of painted wood.  Windiws should be double hung 
    windows with wood trim that would open onto the balcony


 
-
          
    
 Materials were an important element of the plans, and were 
    agreed upon before becoming a part of the Certificate of Appropriateness


 
-
          
    
 As a specific condition of the Certificate of Appropriateness, 
    it was required that working drawings be prepared.  We asked for them on November 
    22, 2000.  We could not find them. They did not exist.  The detailed plans 
    would have shown the materials, the trim and the proper prospective.

 This is the largest collection of pre-1870 buildings in the 
    City of San Francisco


 
-
          
    
 Suggested that the Commission review in detail what had been 
    built on top of this building.


 
-
          
    
 This parapet absolutely would destroy the view for other buildings

 (3)
    
 Add a Notice of 
    Special Restriction stating the conditions of approval and also referencing 
    and attaching to it the original C of A and the conditions that this Commission 
    imposed.  She believes this is reasonable as an amendment to the original

    on.  In the future we will know what is to going to be required and what is
