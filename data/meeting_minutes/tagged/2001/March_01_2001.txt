Status Report on Annual
Office Limit


 


SPEAKER(S):


Sue Hestor

- She would like to know when the public would be allowed to have input on this
item.

- Is the public testimony on the 15th or the 22nd of March?

- She would just like to have some sort of information in writing for the
public.


Jeff Heller

- He has concerns about having outside architects consider the projects.

- Bringing outside people created several major problems in the past. 

- The people who came in were not substantially educated in regards to Master
Plans, etc. Eventually, this idea was abandoned.


Joe O’Donaghue

- Responding to Commissioner Baltimore’s question regarding housing and what we
can expect regarding low cost housing, not affordable housing--we should look
to the past. In the past, a certain amount of housing and millions of dollars
were collected for extraction fees from downtown developers. We need to see
what we did with those millions of dollars.

- Part of the analysis of today is to look at what worked before.

- We also need to see who were the benefactors of that non-profit housing.


John Bardis

- Mr. O’Donaghue has a very interesting analysis.

- The Commission needs to look deeply in the process of fees being asked as
mitigation measures for the housing impacts of these developments that are
being submitted for application.

- This has been a problem the City has had for 30 to 40 years. The imbalance
between what we are providing in terms of construction of facilities that can
expand the construction work force and the construction of the housing to house
that work force.

- Because of that imbalance we have the problems we have today.


David Cincotta

- He is one of the participants of the projects being considered next week.
People are wondering how much time they have available, how these projects will
be presented, etc

SPEAKER(S):


(+) Alice Barkley


- At the
end of the first hearing the Commission made a motion of intent to make certain
revisions.
 
One of the staff
recommendations was a setback to match the lightwell of Mr. Moran.
 
This has been done.
 
The sponsor would lower the building.
 
The building has been redesigned to be
lower.


- The
building has been lowered 5Â½ feet from the first design.


- All the
conditions the Commission requested have been met.


(+) Joe O'Donaghue


- There
have been substantial reductions made to the building.


- This is
a single family who would just like to have their family together.


- The
opposition will always be in opposition.


The Commission just needs to bring a closure to this.
 
To string it out further will just be a
great detriment to this family.


(+) Patrick McGrew – Project Architect


- There
has been a considerable amount of compromise in the changes of design to meet
the request of the neighbors.


- There
have been many changes done already to the design to match the design of the
neighborhood.


- No
matter what is done, the opposition will always be in disagreement.


(-) Joe Butler – DR Requestor


- What he
is asking for is what is in their brief, which was distributed a week ago.
 
He doesn't understand why the Planning
Director just viewed it last night.


(-) John Litgo


- He would
like to thank the Commission for taking all this testimony into consideration.


- Although
they are very disappointed with the fact that the Commission didn't accept
their settlement envelope, they certainly respect the opinion of the
Commission.


- At the
previous hearing, Commissioner Fay asked how much could the building be
lowered.
 
Department of Public Works has
determined that the house could be lowered without disrupting the sewer.


- If the
Commission were to accept the project sponsor's new design, the Commission
would be rewarding them for failing to provide correct information.


(-) Ron Slain


- He lives
across the street from the project sponsor.


- He
resents that Mr. O'Donaghue has to speak badly about the neighborhood.


- Even
with the changes made by the Commission, there is still a negative impact.


- This
does nothing to improve the light and air issues.


- They
feel that they are back at  square one! 


(-) Bob Nelson


- He and
his wife live on the same block as the proposed site.


- The
offer the new design proposed will still have a shadow impact on his house.


- It is
still possible to lower f the building three more feet.


- If a
north lightwell could be built, it would allow a lot more sunlight to his
property.


- Please
adopt their settlement offer.


(-) Joann Nelson


- She
lives next door to the proposed building.


- She and
her husband have done a lot of renovations to their home in order to let more
light come into their home.
 
This has
taken a lot of money and effort.


- The
proposed construction will block much sunlight into their home.


- There
will also be a considerable amount of heat lost.
 
It will be very cold.


- It is a
very noble cause to take an elderly parent into your home yet it doesn't have
to be such a tall home. 


(-) Michael Moran


- He is
also a next-door neighbor on the uphill side.


- He would
like the Commission to require that all deck rails on the proposed project be
as open as possible in order to have more sunlight come into his property.


- Another
request would be that all the vertical walls should be set back five feet.


- Please
adopt their settlement envelope.


(-) Joe Butler


-
Displayed a design, which shows the spirit and intent of the Commission.


- The
fifth level still needs to be mitigated regarding the light and air issues.


 


ACTION:
 
Take
DR and approve project with open railings (all around) and a 15-foot setback on
vertical wall.

INDIA
BASIN INDUSTRIAL REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AREA PLAN AMENDMENT/ 3433 THIRD STREET)

- Request for a finding of consistency with the General Plan for an amendment
to the Redevelopment Plan for the India Basin Industrial Park.
 
The amendment would apply to Lot 23 in
Assessor’s Block 5203, 3433 Third Street at the southeast corner of Cargo
Way.
 
It would allow up to 50,000 gross
square feet of Retail and Business Services uses (a category that includes
business and professional offices) and would reduce the parking requirement to
one space for each 1,000 occupied square feet of Business Services space, and
one space for each 7,000 gross square feet of telecommunication space.
 
It would reduce the loading requirement to
one space for each 100,000 square feet of Retail, Business Services, and
Telecommunications space.
 
This
amendment would enable the construction of a proposed development at 3433 Third
Street, described below.


 
Preliminary
Recommendation: Find the proposed amendment of the Redevelopment Plan
consistent with the General Plan.


 
(Continued
from Regular Meeting of February 8, 2001)


 


SPEAKER(S):


(+)
Stanley Miraoka – Project Manager


- The proposed plan came about as a result of the
Agency processing the allocations of this building.


- The existing plans permit up to 196,000 square feet
of retail and business space.


- The bulk exists at Bay View Plaza.


- This is an appropriate plan amendment.


- They have made a determination that the limitation
on the parking and loading requirements are fine.


- The building will be mixed use--commercial and
retail.


(-) Sue
Hestor


- At the hearing of the BOS some important
information came up.
 
This building will
take about 25 megawatts of electricity.




- In San Francisco there has been a proposal to
replace the power station in the Bay View Hunters Point area.


- If the Potrero Hill plan comes about, this power
station will not be able to be closed and many people will still suffer from
health problems.


- This project has to abide by the energy standards
imposed on the City.


(+) Steve
Vettel


- The energy demand on this project will be 7
megawatts of electricity not 25.


- What's before the Commission is the office and the
retail plan.

their home.

PUBLIC COMMENT


 


At this time, members of the public may address the
Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject
matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.
 
With respect to agenda items, your
opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached
in the meeting with one exception.
 
When
the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members
of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public
hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during
the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.


Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three
minutes. 


 


The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking
action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including
those items raised at public comment.


In response to public comment, the Commission is limited to: 


 


(1)
responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or


(2)
requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or 


(3)
directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.
 
(Government Code Section 54954.2(a))


 


 


Joe O'Donaghue – Residential Builders


Re:
 


- When
left-wing groups take power they become more reactionary than their right-wing
counterparts.


- This is
not a progressive City -- it is regressive.


- Both of
these contentions were validated at a Board of Supervisor's hearing recently.


- The Land
Use Committee holds hearings at the same time as the Planning Commission
hearings.
 
This is an unprecedented
move.


- The
Board staff guaranteed him personally that because of the large body of people
expected, the hearing would be held in the large hearing room.


- Three
minutes per person have always been allocated to both sides.


- Ms.
Hestor has come before the Planning Department requesting that the public
receive due notice on information regarding land use matters 10 to 30 days in
advance, something that the new Board of Supervisors has conveniently forgotten
about.


-
Regardless of what the press has said, what happened was that he and other
members arrived early for the moratorium hearing and were sitting quietly in
the large Board of Supervisor's chambers.


They were then informed that the hearing was changed to a smaller
hearing room.
 
He left the chambers and
went to the smaller hearing room.
 
He
requested a point of order on the parliamentary rule.
 
Mr. McGoldrick denied his point of order since the meeting had
not yet begun.
 
He asked Mr. McGoldrick
why the meeting had been moved to a smaller hearing room.
 
Mr. McGoldrick refused to answer but later
mentioned that it was for security reasons. He then later asked the sheriff to
escort me out of the hearing room.


- His
organization has never been disruptive in any of the meetings they attend.
