D.          CONSENT CALENDAR
The following items appear to the uncontested cases, and as of the  of publication of the Commission Calendar, no letters or phone calls opposing the requested authorization have been received by the Department staff.  Following review by the Department, it has been determined that the project complies with the criteria of Section 303 of the Planning Code.  The Planning Director's preliminary recommendation is for approval with appropriate conditions.  These cases are therefore considered routine and will be acted upon by a single roll call vote of the Commission.  There will be no staff presentation nor discussion of these items unless a member of the Planning Commission or the General Public so requests.  In the event of a request for discussion, the Planning Commission may entertain limited discussion prior to taking action or continue the matter to another regular scheduled hearing date.  The Commission President will announce the date of the hearing at the time the item is removed form the uncontested calendar.
