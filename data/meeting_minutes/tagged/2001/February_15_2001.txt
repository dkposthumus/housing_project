BATTERY STREET HOTEL
 - 
Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact 
        Report (EIR).
 
The proposed 
        project would demolish three existing structures at 425‑427 Battery 
        Street and 418 Clay Street, and would construct a new 11‑story mixed 
        use building on a 14,025 square foot site in downtown San Francisco (Assessor's 
        Block 206, Lots 3, 4, and 5).
 
The 
        new building would include about 17,700 square feet of retail space, and 
        up to 348 hotel rooms.
 
The hotel, 
        called Club Quarters, would be a private business hotel for exclusive 
        use of member organizations.
 
Off 
        street loading would be accessed from Merchant Street.


No off‑street parking would be provided on site.
 
Note:
 
written comments on the Draft EIR will be accepted 
        at the Planning Department offices until the close of business on February 
        20, 2001.




Preliminary Recommendation: No Action Required

(-/+) Christopher Cole
 


















- His building is a two-story building next to the proposed 
        site.


- He also has concerns and issues and is working with 
        the project sponsor.


















(-) Alexander Sidle
 


















- He is one of the tenants of the proposed project.


- He was interested in the portion of the EIR related 
        to jobs and displacement.


- He would like to have these concerns addressed.


- The EIR states that there are about 100 tenants when 
        there are actually about 300.


- The project has low proposed employment.


- Displacement of jobs in downtown is very significant.


(-) Roger 
        Brandon


- This is across the street from a popular hotel as 
        well as another hotel about a block away.


-

(WYCKO: 558-5972)




525 Golden Gate Avenue - City Administration Building
 - 
        
Certification of Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR).
 
The project involves 
        the demolition of an existing, vacant State of California office building 
        and construction of a new building for City offices on City-owned property 
        at the southwest corner of Polk Street and Golden Gate Avenue on Lot 1 
        of Assessor’s Block 766 in the San Francisco Civic Center area.
 
Two options are under consideration: Option 
        A would entail construction of a 14-story, 181-foot-tall building containing 
        about 255,500 square feet of office space, while Option B would consist 
        of a 12-story, 156-foot-tall building containing about 215,000 square 
        feet of office space.
 
Each option 
        would include two basement parking levels containing about 100 spaces 
        (corresponding to about 140 spaces with valet operations).


The project would require a height reclassification (amendment 
        of the height and bulk designations in the zoning maps and General Plan 
        maps) of the site to accommodate the proposed building and will also seek 
        a Variance from the Planning Code for on-site parking and loading.


 
Preliminary Recommendation: 
        Certification of FEIR





          
        




SPEAKER(S):


(-) Diane Cramton


- There is an environmental impact 
        in regards to shadows on the learning center close by.


- Children need to have sunlight.


(-) Brother Cohen


- The zoning for this area does not 
        allow such a tall building.


- This will cause an environmental 
        impact on the learning center.


- The building should not be so tall.


(-) Michael Levin


- He does not have problems with 
        the project except that any City building ought to set an example to all 
        the developers.


- If there is any significant change 
        to the building from the photo on the report, there should be a supplemental 
        EIR written.


- This is an important building in 
        an important location.


(-) Roger Brandon


- This building is located behind 
        the courthouse.


- He does not see the purpose of 
        developing another government building.


- This building is not good for the 
        City and people should be against this project.

- Assessors Block 327, Lot 22, southeast 
        corner of Powell and O'Farrell Streets. 
Appeal of a Preliminary Negative Declaration
 for the proposed project 
        that would demolish three existing buildings, one to three stories tall, 
        fronting on O'Farrell Street (171, 179, 181 O'Farrell St.) and would retain 
        and renovate the 150 Powell Street building including the construction 
        of a new seven floor addition to 150 Powell Street structure on the O'Farrell 
        Street lots.
 
Three floors would 
        be added to a portion of the 150 Powell building. The proposed project 
        would be an increase of about 35,900 gsf of retail space and about 19,100 
        gsf of office space. The renovated and remodeled building would be about 
        105 feet tall.
 
The Elevated Shops Building is a Category IV 
        (Contextual Importance) building.
 
The 
        project site is in the C-3-G zoning district and an 80-130-F Height/Bulk

- There is an issue regarding parking and the loading 
        dock in front of his building.


- There will be 28 windows, which will be completely 
        blocked by the proposed project.


- He hasn't had time to look completely at the reports.


(+) Steve 
        Atkinson – Baker and McKenzie - Representing project sponsor


- This negative declaration was prepared by a very experienced 
        consultant and was reviewed thoroughly by the Department.
 
A firm of great experience prepared the transportation 
        study.
 
The report totally meets 
        CEQA standards.


- The appellant owns a vacant building adjacent to the 
        proposed project.
 
None of the 
        issues raised in the appeal are meritorious.


- The sponsor is seeking an exception of the off-street 
        loading requirement but this will be brought to the Commission in a future 
        hearing.


- Regarding the loading dock, the negative declaration 
        states that there is no impact on loading with or without an off-street 
        loading.
 
Much of the loading will 
        be done in the storefront and with limited hours.


- Regarding the property-line windows, there is no impact 
        since the code allows for this type of construction.

        requiring Conditional-Use Authorization for dwelling units in a C-M District 
        per Section 215(a) of the Planning Code.


The proposal is to increase the floor-to-ceiling height of the 
        ground floor by 6’-6" and to raise the upper stories of the building 
        to accommodate the taller ground floor.


Although there would still be a total of three stories, the overall 
        height of the building would be increased from the existing height of 
        approximately 32’-0" to approximately 38’-6".
 
In addition, the ground floor would be extended 
        to the rear property line and the facade of the building would be modified.


No change in the number of dwelling units is proposed.


The project is within a C-M (Heavy Commercial) District and a Mixed

        52-feet tall building that will contain three residential units with ground 
        floor parking.
 
This project lies 
        within the Broadway Neighborhood Commercial District and within the 65-A-1 
        Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Approval 
        with Conditions
.





          
        




SPEAKER (S):


(+) Bruce Baumann – Rep. of the project sponsor


- The project is exempt from environmental 
        review and there are no shadow impacts.


- The benefits to the project and 
        mid-block open space are that the project has a rear yard instead of a 
        side yard.
 
The project is consistent 
        with the policies regarding mid-block open space.


(+) Alice Barkley – Attorney for the project sponsor


- The site is unusual and warrants 
        a waiver.


- This project does not impact any 
        of the neighbors.


(-)
 
Peter Craggy


- He is one of the owners of 540 
        Pacific.


- There is a substantial lot between 
        his property and the proposed property.


- The notice that he received stated 
        that the property was located at 2 Rowland Street and not 2 Rowland Place.


- He needs to see how this affects 
        his property related to shadows.


- The people in his building use 
        the yard to have their lunch. 


(-) Francesca Valdez


- Her property is adjacent to the 
        proposed site.


- She opposes the project since the 
        proposed property has been in a commercial zone and used as commercial 
        use.
 
This change will cause disarray 
        to the existing businesses.


- Rowland is a narrow alley.
 


- The building height will cause 
        shadows to the adjacent properties.


- Many of the businesses are restaurants 
        and are open until about 2:00 a.m.


(-) Carl Prescott


- There are three exits that run 
        into Rowland.


- The garbage under the stairways 
        will cause problems to the new owners.


- The height of the building will 
        block his view of the City.


(-) Steve Soriani – Owner of the Bubble Lounge


- The stage in his establishment 
        will be adjacent to the proposed project.


- They are discussing alternatives 
        to block out noise.

Request for Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application 
        No. 200006213244 proposing to construct a one‑story addition ‑ 
        391 square feet in size ‑ on the second floor on an existing deck 
        adjacent to the master bedroom, above the garage on the east side of the 
        property.
 
The addition will accommodate an exercise room 
        and a dressing room and will not encroach into the required rear or side 
        yards.
 
The property is in an RH‑1 (D) (Residential, 
        House, Single‑Family, Detached) District and a 40‑X Height 
        and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: 
        Do not take discretionary review and approve project as submitted.


(Continued 
        from Regular Meeting December 14, 2001)





          
        




SPEAKER(S):


(+) Christopher Moscone – Representing one of the DR 
        requestors


- The project sponsor has worked 
        in good faith with him and his client and his client's issues have been 
        resolved.


(-) Sue Hestor – Representing one of the DR requestors


- This project was continued from 
        December because she discovered that multiple building permits had been 
        taken out. They had not done what the Department requires them to do--do 
        one application for all of the improvements.


- She disagrees with the Department's 
        legal characterization.


- The Planning Department did not 
        pull up the variance decision.


- The Planning Department did not 
        apply the Planning Code to this project.


- The developer is adding view rooms 
        all over the place.


- All the windows have 180
o
 
        views.


 
(-) Byron Litman – DR Requestor


- He and his wife have lived on Sea 
        Cliff Avenue for 20 years.


- Their house is across the street 
        from the proposed project.


- He read a passage from the Sea 
        Cliff magazine published 85 years ago, which states that all houses should 
        conserve the beautiful sea views.


- When the project was originally 
        proposed there was no opposition.
 
But 
        through a series of changes, it has become too massive. 


- Trees can be adjusted, a building 
        cannot.


- If this project is approved, it 
        will take away the view that his family has enjoyed for many years.


- He urges the Commission to deny 
        this project.


(-) Marlene Marsai


- She lives on Sea Cliff Avenue across 
        the street from the proposed project.


- She had asked that the project 
        be reshaped for less neighborhood impact.


- Sea Cliff was established in a 
        master plan to allow for view and limit the height of trees.


- Trees should just be allowed to 
        grow to the level of the rooflines.


- The allowance of light and air 
        is a character of this neighborhood.


- Whenever the trees became unruly, 
        they were trimmed.


- The request to lower the trees 
        has been going on since 1997.


- An arborist has been consulted, 
        which has said that the trees can be safely trimmed.


- There should be a condition that 
        requires the trees be lowered to the lowest level allowed.


(-) Mr. Hirsh 


- He lives across the street from 
        the proposed project.


- He was sitting in Mr. Passmore's 
        office in July of 1999.
 
He asked 
        if there was going to be any other buildings and the answer was no.
 
All he could recall about the variance was 
        that there be no construction on Saturday and Sundays.


- The trees grew and began to block 
        their view.


- Although there is not much to see 
        from his attic window, there is a feeling of openness.


(-) Tarrance Marsai


- The home in which he lives is across 
        the street from the proposed project.


Although it's a large home, it is designed in a way for he and 
        his family to enjoy open space and it does not block his neighbors' views.


- The reason that this has become 
        such an issue is because the trees have grown just too tall.


- If this project is approved, he 
        would like to have the project sponsor have conditions to keep an open 
        space and to keep shrubbery to certain limits.


(-) Mr. Morgolan


- He lives on Scenic Way, which is 
        one block away from the proposed project.


- He was not notified of this hearing.


- He has trees in front of his property 
        yet when these trees become obstructive, they are trimmed.


(+) Alice Barkley – Representing project sponsor


- This project is not by a developer.


It is the project of a homeowner.


- There is a provision that each 
        home should have a side yard.


- The project is going to be set 
        back more.


- One of the speakers showed pictures, 
        which were taken 12 years ago.


- The trees grow 24 inches per year.


- The project sponsor has trimmed 
        the trees.


- She would like to have the Commission 
        take Discretionary Review with three conditions:
 
1) conditions subject to Mr. Badiner's letter; 
        2) plans be revised; 3) trees to be trimmed annually.





          
        




ACTION:
 
Take 
        Discretionary Review and approve project with the following conditions:


1) that the design of project shall conform to the plans presented today;


2) the BAP affirms the ZA's written determination that the proposed project 
        will not require a variance application;


3) the project sponsor will retain a licensed arborist to trim the two 
        New Zealand Christmas trees at the front yard annually, to the maximum 
        extent feasible without harming the health of the trees.

proposing to merge two dwelling units into one dwelling unit in 
        a RH‑2 (House, Two‑Family) District and 40‑X Height

Preliminary Recommendation
:
 
Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the proposal 
        as it was submitted.





          
        




SPEAKER(S):


(+) Scott Lamert – Project Sponsor


- The Planning Commission is responsible 
        for representing the public.
 
This 
        project does not harm in any way any of the neighbors.


- He purchased the house for his 
        family since his family is growing.


- They are not changing the footprint 
        of the home or changing the faÃ§ade.


-


Before they purchased the house, they did research and found out 
        that there would be no difficulty to merge the units.
 
Since then the Commission has approved a policy about dwelling unit 
        mergers.


- There are no complaints regarding 
        this merger and the neighbors and neighborhood associations support this 
        merger.


(+) Joe O'Donahue


- Families should be allowed to stay 
        in this City.


- This family, which is growing and 
        requires more space, wants to live here.


- There is no protest to this project.


- This is a matter of equity and 
        mercy rather than justice.

Request for 
        Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application No. 2000/09/20/1100, 
        Case No. 2000.1265D, for the property located at 282 Upper Terrace, Lot 
        No. 002I in Assessor's Block 2629.
 
Discretionary 
        Review is requested of Building Permit proposing to construct a two‑story 
        rear addition with a second-floor roof deck and stairs on a dwelling in 
        a RH‑2 (House, Two‑Family) District and a 40‑X Height 
        and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation:


T
ake discretionary review and approve 
        the project per staff recommendations.





          
        




SPEAKER(S):


(-) Dr. Barbara Hennessy – DR Requestor


- She is 
        the only neighbor who will be affected by the construction.


- The project 
        sponsor did not show her the plans before submitting them to the Department.


- The most 
        important aspect is the sunlight being blocked to her home because of 
        the construction.


- She requests 
        that the project sponsor make some modifications.
 
She made this proposal to the project sponsor 
        but the sponsor wasn't in agreement.


- Her second 
        request is that the project sponsor put siding on the wall on Ms. Hennessy's 
        side.


- She does 
        not think that these requests are too much.


- She hopes 
        that the Commission takes this into consideration.


(-) Gary Gerber – Contractor and Designer


- Ms. Hennessy 
        has pretty much covered everything.


- He is a 
        solar engineer and has made an analysis of shadow studies.
 
Because of the proposed construction the sunlight 
        to the DR requestor will be impacted.


(-) Greg Framlechlin – Architect


- He was 
        hired to view the plans and try to come up with a possible mediation.


- The hallway 
        on the upper floor is rather large for the proposed house.
 
He suggests reducing the hallway and office, 
        which would allow for a window and light to come through.


- He did 
        some sunlight studies and showed some computer diagrams, which show the 
        impacts.


(+) Alfred Sanchez – Rep. of Project Sponsor


- He is willing 
        to take into consideration the suggestions made by staff.


- (He displayed 
        a model of the proposed construction.)


- There has 
        been some hill cutting to bring out the deck.


- He does 
        not want to shove his project into the hill.


- If he were 
        to bring the construction into the hill it would cause a shadow affect 
        to the DR requestor.


(+) Carol Cox, Project Sponsor


- The DR 
        requestor stated that she didn't make an attempt to speak to her when 
        she did.


- There are 
        several discrepancies in the review analysis (e.g. that the sunlight to 
        the DR requestor will be diminished, which is not so).


- She was 
        born and raised in this neighborhood so she is familiar with the neighborhood.


(+) Darie Saba


- She does 
        not live in the neighborhood but is a friend of the project sponsor.


- If the 
        proposed construction is reduced, the addition will look like a closet.


(+) Robert Tarlin


- He lives 
        a few houses away from the proposed project.


- His house 
        has an identical floor plan.


- He has 
        a small open area in his back yard.


- Taking 
        off three feet will not provide any more sunlight.


- He supports 
        the construction of this proposal.


(+) Kenneth Gordon


- In general 
        support of the proposed.


(+) (name unclear)


- She lives 
        on Upper Terrace


- Her niece 
        and her niece's mother, who is the project sponsor, grew up in this house.


She should not have to compromise three feet. 


- It is very 
        unfair that her niece's project is not going forth.





          
        




ACTION:
 
Take 
        Discretionary Review and approve project per staff recommendations regarding 
        finished side material.

Sue Hestor


Re:
 
250 Sea 
        Cliff Avenue


- She feels 
        very frustrated since she sent a letter to the Planning Department on 
        December 11, requesting consolidated plans.


Since then she kept calling the Department trying to find out if 
        the plans had been filed.
 
The 
        plans were submitted on December 28; but she did not receive a copy even 
        though she should have received a copy.




- She then 
        spent the next six weeks trying to find out where the plans were.
 
Various planners were on vacation yet she left 
        messages.
 
No one could find the 
        plans.
 


- The plans 
        were finally found 10 days ago.
 
Plans 
        that she should have gotten on December 28, she got in February.


- The first 
        notice she received of a variance was when she got a copy of the calendar 
        last Friday.


- The planner 
        mentioned that there wasn't a variance report and that the only documents 
        the Commission was going to receive would be what Ms. Barkley would submit.


- She later 
        discovered by one of the DR requestors that there was a variance set of 
        plans that she had never seen.


- If she 
        is involved in a case, there is no excuse for staff not to give her the 
        same information that the Commission, DR requestors, etc. receive.





          
        




Joe O'Donaghue – Residential Builders


Re:
 
Ken Garcia


- He wants 
        to make it clear that the ideas Mr. Garcia has that Mr. O'Donaghue's company 
        is moving to Oakland are not true.
 
Mr. 
        O'Donaghue has been trying to contact Mr. Garcia but has not been able 
        to do so.
 
Then, Mr. Garcia's attorney 
        writes a letter to him stating that Mr. O'Donaghue was trespassing.


- Also, last 
        week at the BOS, Mr. Garcia stated that Mr. O'Donaghue walked out of a 
        hearing.
 
What happened was that 
        he was denied access to a hearing, something that has never happened in 
        the BOS.
 
The Land Use hearings were moved from a bigger 
        room to a smaller room.
 
Since 
        he brought a lot of members, they were denied entrance.


- Instead 
        of denying entrance, they should have reduced the time of the speakers.
