                    Discussion and possible action on modifications to the Planning Commission's Inclusionary Housing Policy.
SPEAKER(S):
Steve Vettel
- It is important that the analysis looks at the feasibility of what the Commission is doing if they want to increase the affordability level.
- Before raising the 10% ratio or respond to Supervisor Leno's legislation, someone should do an analysis of the feasibility.
- There is a real danger that with the concern of making affordable housing available to everyone in the city, that building housing would become infeasible.
Calvin Welch – Council of Community Housing Organizations
- It is important that the Commissioners have the number of housing units a year that have been approved pursuant to a conditional use permit versus how many housing units the Commission approves each year that don't have this condition.
- It is important that the Commission understands that the developers can't really  shop around. 
- It is clear that this policy needs to be an ordinance.
- Can this Commission work in a coordinated matter with the housing production agencies in this City to develop a comprehensive program of affordable housing?
Bob Meyers – City Planning Consultant
- There is an article from Mr. Erickson in the recent SPUR newsletter that really states the numbers very clearly and succinctly.
- In San Francisco, labor costs are high, mobilization costs are high, and access in and out of the city is difficult.
- He urges the Commission to tread very carefully.  Ten percent seems to be an acceptable level.  Beyond that the costs get too high.
Joe O'Donahue  - Residential Builders
- A question should be asked:   Why is there a housing crisis in the City? 
- It is important to look at all the proposals and determine why they haven't worked in the past.
Sue Hestor
- Inclusionary housing might be a burden on developers but it is also a recognition that every rental building built after 1979 is totally exempt from rent control.  This has an economic value in San Francisco.
Alice Barkley
- Rent control does not necessarily benefit low and moderate income households in this City.
- Until the Commission has all of the factors, they will not know whether or not the private sector can even do it.
ACTION:          Meeting held.  No action taken.  Staff will bring this matter back to the Commission on 10-11-01 for the Commission to consider proposed modifications.

SPEAKER(S):
(+) Joe Jodowitz – Reuben and Alter
- The project is moving forward and under construction.
- The only issue here is the reduction of 2 feet on the loading dock.
- Even if the loading dock were 12 feet high, this project did not anticipate any large truck traffic.
- The hotel will not have too much commercial truck traffic.
(-) Alexander Seidel
- Trucks that park on Merchant Street block the traffic and cause traffic jams.
- Merchant Street is very small and if there is one vehicle parked there it would block off the street.

ACTION:          Discretionary Review Withdrawn
F.          PUBLIC COMMENT
At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes. 
The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public comment, the commission is limited to: 
(1) responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or
(2) requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or 
(3) directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.  (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))
Joe O'Donaghue
- There was a rumor that Commissioner Salinas had been fired because of him.  This is a false statement.
- If he would have had any problems with Commissioner Salinas, he would have gone to the union to deal with those matters.
- He does not go behind people's backs.  If he dislikes someone, he will deal with that person face to face.
Sue Hestor
- She has concerns about the calendars being paced better.  There have been a few hearings that have been too long.  When this happens, everyone gets tired and no one listens.
- Today the hearing ends before 5:00 p.m.
- There should be a uniform policy on speaker's comments.
- The public deserves the right to the Commissioner's attention.
- The time for public comment should be reconsidered.
Adjournment: 4:45 p.m.
THE DRAFT MINUTES ARE PROPOSED FOR ADOPTION AT THE REGULAR MEETING OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2001.
