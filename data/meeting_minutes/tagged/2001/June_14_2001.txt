 Commission Matters





       
      




 
Theoharis:


There was an article in the Independent Newspaper on Tuesday, 
      June 5 regarding a proposal about Supervisor Peskin's desire to legalize 
      in-law units.
 
Does staff have any information on this?


Lim:
 
There was a point brought up at the Finance 
      Committee meeting regarding having the different departments work together 
      and put together a housing strategy.
 
Will 
      our Department be included?

Did not get any information prior to the release of the proposed legislation 
      by Supervisor Peskin--there is no actual legislation drafted.








-
          
      




In response to Commissioner Lim's comment--in January or February when 
      we started the Work Program discussions we included several items that included 
      our ongoing efforts to coordinate with other agencies on housing.






-
          
      




In terms of receiving notices about the existing efforts toward base 
      community planning, we notified the Commission about the Better Neighborhood 
      meetings that have been and are being conducted.

Finance Committee Meeting is open to the public on Saturday, June 16, 
      2001, at 9:00 at City Hall

Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors 
      and Board of Appeals






-
          
      




BOS:
 
This past Monday the Board of Supervisors 
      had an appeal of a Conditional Use authorization that was granted for an 
      antenna at 501 Laguna Street.
 
That 
      item was continued for two weeks






-
          
      




Also, there was a Conditional Use on a unit development on a rather unusual 
      shaped site, at 19
th
 and Oakwood.


That case was heard by the Board and was continued to allow further 
      consideration.
 
It will be back before the Board on Monday, 
      6/18.

Calvin Welch, Counsel 
      Community Housing Organization






-
          
      




The Department is aware of the critical 
      balance between the creation of jobs and housing--most especially matching 
      the affordability levels of the jobs we are creating& 






-
          
      




Lowering housing cost by increasing 
      housing production is not politicaly correct in this City 


 
- 
 
We have to be really careful when we talk about affordable housing 
      in this City


 
(-) Jim Miko, SOMA Leadership Counsel






-
          
      




We are not anywhere near where the 
      Mission is in this process, or even Dogpatch or other neighborhoods in the 
      City






-
          
      




Pointed out the schedule for the 
      beginning of the base community planning efforts.
 
SOMA Anti-Displacement Coalition will 
      meet this Saturday, June 16, from 10 to Noon, sponsoring a community forum.


It will be held at 65 9th Street.


 
(-) Sue Hestor
 






-
          
      




Concerned about the continuation 
      of this on every calendar to give yourself the flexibility to do things 
      when you are ready.
 
It is a burden 
      on the public.






-
          
      




Concerned about reopening the South 
      of Market zoning; to undo the controls; we might have more lost jobs.


 
(-) Joe O'Donoghue


 
-
 
The Housing crisis is continuing and getting worse instead of 
      getting better






-
          
      




This report is just a fiction and 
      full of inaccuracies






-
          
      




We have to change our methodology


 
(-) Alice Barkley






-
          
      




Concerned about displacement






-
          
      




When you change the definition of 
      what is in the PDR, multimedia will no longer fit–it becomes offices






-
          
      




Industrial Use:


mixed use area is not located strictly in the industrial area, it 
      is located in what has been for a long time a mixed use zone, 






-
          
      




The Moratorium and the Commission's 
      policy did not open housing opportunity sites because the interim controls 
      that this Commission adopted are more restrictive than the moratorium adopted 
      by the Board of Supervisors.
 
They (the BOS) allowed housing to proceed under Conditional Use--you 
      wiped it out.






-
          
      




As far as displacement of PDR is 
      concerned, most of them are in vacant lands, therefore, no job displacement.


 
(-) Quintin Meck, 






-
          
      




Concerned that a lot of displacement 
      has taken place in the last few years

HOUSING ELEMENT OF THE GENERAL PLAN
 - The 
      Department has released a background report, which will provide information 
      needed for the upcoming revisions to the Housing (Residence) Element of 
      the General Plan.
 
This report, Part 
      I of the Housing Element, contains housing data and an evaluation of housing 
      needs in San Francisco.
 
It is available 
      at the Department’s office, and on its web site. (http://www.sfgov.org/planning).


This hearing will allow the Commission and the public to comment 
      on this information and other housing policy issues.





       
      




 
SPEAKER (s):
 


 
(-) Roger Brandon






-
          
      




Land should be preserved for industrial 
      use


 
-
 
Monthly rent rates should be reasonable






-
          
      




There is a need for affordable housing.


It would be better to maintain housing districts in city neighborhoods 
      that are better designed for that purpose






-
          
      




Change the rental policies of several 
      real estates firms.
 
Rent do not 
      need to be so high


 
-
 
San Francisco should remain a small city


 
-
 
Hold the exisiting zoning controls






-
          
      




There is a flaw in this report. 
      There are too many exaggerated economic forecasts. This forecast came from 
      the Association of Bay Area Governments.






-
          
      




Avoid putting high-density development 
      in places where you do not have many of them.
 
By doing so, good quality living conditions 
      in the City are reduced.


 
(-) Calvin Welch, Counseling Communities 
      Housing Organization






-
          
      




Commended the staff on their presentation 
      


 
-
 
Increasing housing construction and at the same time there is 
      an increase in housing cost






-
          
      




The goal is to maximize






-
          
      




The Planning Codes is to provide 
      a policy that links job growth, protection of existing neighborhoods, and 
      natural population growth






-
          
      




Housing that could be afforded to 
      existing San Franciscans and those who would be working here in the future






-
          
      




The greatest deficit that we've 
      faced in the last 11 years has been in affordable housing






-
          
      




We actually exceeded the projection 
      by building 8900 market rates units,






-
          
      




We have fallen short in the affordable 
      sections of our housing elements






-
          
      




That reality should motivate the 
      formation and amendments of the existing residence element.






-
          
      




How do we maximize affordable housing 
      production?
 
Simply approving housing 
      development does not work in San Francisco if the goal is to maximize affordable 
      housing for San Franciscans.


 
(-)
 
Jaime Roth, San Francisco Chamber of Commerce






-
          
      




Poll showed that most San Franciscans 
      can not afford to live in this City






-
          
      




We need to expedite the approval 
      process; to encourage infill housing; maximize the construction of housing 
      units next to transit; and we also need density


 
-
 
We cannot allow this housing crisis to keep going 






-
          
      




Home ownership should be more affordable 
      to San Francisco






-
          
      




The San Francisco work force is 
      in danger of being squeezed out of the City






-
          
      




Our great City needs innovative 
      policies to make housing and homeownership more affordable to all San Franciscan.






-
          
      




67% of the City's renters expressed 
      that they would like to buy a home in San Francisco, but feel that homeownership 
      is out of their reach






-
          
      




53% agreed that the City should 
      create new programs to help middle income workers






-
          
      




53% also support increasing the 
      density of housing along transit lines






-
          
      




1/3 of all San Franciscans are so 
      concerned about the high cost of housing, that they considering leaving 
      the City altogether






-
          
      




Numbers speak for themselves.


San Francisco voters want better housing options and they are frustrated 
      by the high housing cost






-
          
      




We just want the Commission to consider 
      the needs and aspirations of all San Franciscans 


(-) Gabriel Metcalf, SPUR


 
-
 
Virtually everyone in City agrees that we 
      need more affordable housing to be produced each year than we currently 
      do


 
-


Increasing supplies bring down the costs






-
          
      




It is good for the City if we build 
      enough housing that can meet the City's share of projected population growth






-
          
      



      Building housing--if it is well planed and well located--is the tool we 
      need to strengthen the 






-
          
      



      Neighborhoods. It is what allows us to support a transit-oriented City. 
      It is what allow us to support neighborhood commercial districts






-
          
      



      Looking forward to see the next phase of the residence element which is 
      going to talk about strategies--not just targets--but how we are going to 
      achieve those targets


 
(-) Alice Barkley






-
          
      




There are several factors that have 
      to be considered.
 
One is neighborhood 
      politics. 






-
          
      




Families in San Francisco have dropped 
      by 12%


 
-


The City needs an affordable housing program


 
-


More Middle class families would be living in the City


 
-


Consider increasing the density where it is appropriate--giving bonuses 
      for affordable units






-
          
      




Encourage the private sector to 
      come up with the lowest rates 


 
(-)
 
Sue Hestor




-
 
Troubled by the Department's abandonment of 
      tracking unit sizes--which comes through in repeated places in this report






-
          
      




Page 6 talks about the average household 
      size increased between 1990 and 2000, including doubling up of occupancy 
      in existing housing units






-
          
      




Page 19:
 
the City has not collected informational housing 
      unit sizes since 1996






-
          
      




Page 18: reminded you that Live/work 
      was 18% of the housing stock that was added from 1991 to 2000


 
(-) 
      Joe O'Donohue






-
          
      




Housing crisis started in 1986






-
          
      




This Commission is not responsible 
      for the shortage of housing.
 
The shortage was created in 1986--at least that was the second phase 
      of the shortage of housing--when we came up with the demolition controls 
      ordinances, RCC, and RCA of the Richmond and the Sunset.






-
          
      




At that time the builders pontificated 
      about the fact that family housing was not being built because you could 
      not build it. Just like you can't do 2 bedroom live/work units because it 
      is a prohibited use






-
          
      




For this Commission to be berated 
      because the staff can not control the cost of building is a redundancy.


Need to change the definition of affordable housing.


Affordable housing is subsidized housing

185 POST 
      STREET (PRADA)
 
- 
Public Hearing 
      on Draft Environmental Impact Report
:


On
 
Assessors 
      Block 310, Lot 18, the 3,600-square-foot project site, situated within the 
      Kearny-Market-Mason-Sutter Conservation District, is occupied by a vacant 
      six-story-plus-basement structure.
 
The 
      proposed project would consist of demolition of the existing 26,200-square-foot 
      building and construction of a new ten-story-plus-basement, 130-foot tall 
      building that would serve as the West Coast headquarters and retail store 
      of the apparel company Prada USA.
 
The 
      new structure would contain approximately 39,300 square feet with part of 
      the basement serving as storage and mechanical equipment space, display 
      space and a reception area on the ground floor, retail space on the second 
      through fifth levels, open space on the sixth level, showroom space on the 
      sixth and seventh levels, office space on the eighth and ninth levels, and 
      a private residential space on the top floor.


In total, the project would provide approximately 4,400 sq. ft. of 
      office space, 6,800 sq. ft. of retail space, 1,500 sq. ft. of showroom space, 
      1,700 sq. ft. of residential space, 2,250 sq. ft. of open space, and 22,650 
      sq. ft. of storage and other space.
 
The 
      site is within the C-3-R (Downtown Commercial, Retail) Zoning District and 
      80-130-F Height and Bulk District.
 
Note:
 
Written 
      comments will be received at the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m., on 
      June 19, 2001.
 


 
Preliminary Recommendations:


No action required.





       
      




 
SPEAKER (s):
 


 
(-) Dr. Charles Thiel






-
          
      




This building was constructed after 
      1906






-
          
      




Evaluated safe after the San Andreas 
      Earthquake






-
          
      




177 Post Street was constructed 
      after the 1906 earthquake






-
          
      




It is substantially different from 
      the City Hall building, in that City Hall is a free standing building with 
      no adjacent structure with which they could collide






-
          
      




We at 177 Post Street are the one 
      with which the PRADA Building may collide, if the building is not adequately 
      designed






-
          
      




Engineers indicated the separation 
      between our buildings would be 23 inches, they indicated that this separation 
      would accommodate the earthquake displacement, assuming that our building 
      is a 1988 Building Code compliant structure.
 
This assumption is erroneous






-
          
      




Our building was constructed over 
      90 years ago, not within the last 3 






-
          
      




They estimated that their unrestrained 
      building would deflect in excess of 42 inches not the 23 inches that they 
      assumed would be adequate to accommodate the deflection of both buildings






-
          
      




It is their assessment that the 
      buildings would collide during an earthquake, creating catastrophic results--both 
      to each of the buildings and to the public itself






-
          
      




The increase of vulnerability to 
      our building and the public by the development decision today, is unacceptable






-
          
      




Requested that the Draft Environmental 
      Impact assessment report, be revised, to add mitigation measures to protect 
      the adjacent buildings and the public.
 






-
          
      




Require the Developer to design 
      a new building, so the seismic performance does not post an earthquake damage 
      threat to adjacent buildings 






-
          
      




Require the Developer to provide 
      that the adjacent building owners be technical peer reviewers of the proposed 
      design documents; if the technical peer review has unresolved issues, the 
      Director of the Building Department should be advised--who then should advise 
      on how to resolve these issues prior to issuing the building permits


 
(-) Thomas P. Dove






-
          
      




There are current design violations 
      that are not adequately addressed in the EIR






-
          
      




Believed the current design violates 
      the CEQA, particularly sections 21084.1 and 15064.5 subsection (b)






-
          
      




Also believed that current design 
      violates City Planning Code, Article 11, the project is incomperable with 
      the requirements of the C-3 District


 
-
 
Earthquake safety here is very questionable


 
(+) Jason Duckworth


 
-


Lives a few blocks away from the site


 
-


Urge the Commission to approve the EIR


 
-


Would increase the value of neighborhood buildings


 
-


 
Are we destroying something 
      that is really valuable to the architecture of this great City?


 
(+) Mark Donohue






-
          
      




EIR is clear and meets design guidelines






-
          
      




Proposed building would indeed be 
      different from its neighbor.
 
It would, as the EIR suggests, not meet certain guidelines for the 
      conservation district in which it is located






-
          
      




As an architect feels in this case, 
      the differences offered by this project are not a bad thing, but rather 
      a good thing


 
-
 
The draft EIR identified two areas within 
      the historical architectural resources category that the PRADA Building 
      would be different from the guidelines of the district and therefore have 
      a significant impact in the character of the district. 


 
(+
) David Meckel, Dean Architectural 
      School at CCAS






-
          
      




The economic, social and urban vitality 
      of cities can only be maintained through renewal and regeneration






-
          
      




The nature of retail further emphasis 
      this need, which is recognized in section 5a through the description of 
      Area of History






-
          
      




The evaluation of the map under 
      the title  Progressive Development of KMNS District , dated December 2000, 
      showed 5 categories.
 
The category 
      of 1946 - 1980 makes up only 9.6% of the buildings in the district.


It is this category that holds most of the unlisted buildings and 
      provides the opportunity for increased fatalities

      off-street parking from 57 to 6 spaces, pursuant to Planning Code Section
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
      151.
 
The project proposes to provide 
      6 parking spaces (4 independently accessible parking spaces and 2 tandem 
      spaces) for approximately 15,769 square feet of occupied outpatient clinic 
      space and approximately 9,864 of administrative space on a site which presently 
      provides no off-street parking spaces. The total proposed occupied floor 
      area equals 25,633 square feet.
 
Under 
      Planning Code Section 151, the proposed uses require a total of 72 off-street 
      parking spaces, where 1 off-street space is required for every 300 square 
      feet of occupied clinic space and 1 off-street space is needed for every 
      500 square feet of occupied administrative space. The project receives a 
      legal parking credit of 15 spaces for the previous retail use, pursuant 
      to Planning Code Section 150 (d).
 
After 
      applying the legal parking credit, 57 off-street spaces are required.


The subject property falls within a NC-3 (Moderate-Scale Commercial

      17TH STREET
 - north side between Castro and Douglass Streets, Lot 011 
      in
 
Assessor's Block 2623.
 
Request 
      of Discretionary Review of Building Demolition Permit Application No. 9814005 
      and Building Permit Application No. 9814006. The proposal would alter an 
      existing vacant one‑story over garage, single‑family dwelling 
      into a three‑story over garage, three‑family dwelling in an 
      RH‑3 (Residential, House, Three‑Family) District and a 40‑X 
      Height and Bulk District. Note: This project was previously heard by the 
      Commission on April 6, 2000 and May 10, 2001, respectively. Following public 
      testimony on April 6, 2000, the Commission moved to continue the hearing 
      indefinitely, so the Project Sponsor could develop a design that 
(1) 
      does not require demolition of the existing structure (the demolition building 
      permit application will be withdrawn by the project sponsor); (2) retains 
      a substantial portion of the front part of the Victorian house; and (3) 
      allows three dwelling units to be constructed on the site.
 The revised 
      project proposes to retain approximately 42 feet of the front of the existing 
      building which includes both exterior side walls and some of the interior 
      walls. The existing facade would be preserved and moved forward by approximately 
      3 feet 4 inches and lowered by approximately 4 feet. The facade would be 
      attached to a reinforced and expanded structure constructed between its 
      new location and the existing portions of the sidewalls, which are to remain 
      in place. The sidewalls would be extended downward by approximately 4 feet 
      and the 3‑foot 11‑inch parapet would be removed. The revised 
      project would further include building additions above and behind the retained 
      portion of the existing building, resulting in a three‑story over 
      garage, three‑family dwelling. The revised project would also require 
      the justification of a rear yard variance, which will be heard by the Zoning 
      Administrator concurrently with the discretionary review.
 


 
 
Preliminary Recommendation: Because the revised 
      project has been determined by the Department of Building Inspection to 
      not require a demolition permit under the Building Code, the Planning Department 
      believes that it is consistent with the Commission's instruction to not 
      demolish the existing house as communicated on April 6, 2000. However, as 
      to whether or not, the proposal is consisted with the Commission's second 
      instruction of substantial retention of front part of the building must 
      be a decision of the current members of the Commission. No specific positions 
      or instructions were provided on April 6, 2000. In evaluating whether substantial 
      retention has been achieved, the Commission should consider the removal 
      of the front facade from the foundation (temporary storage off‑site) 
      and reattaching a restored facade 3 feet forward and 4 feet lower than the 
      current location. It is the Department's position that the restored facade 
      can and should be reattached at the existing location with some minor alteration 
      at the base to accommodate the modified driveway entrance.

On 4/6/00, the Commission asked us to come with a new design

Hope you had chance to look at the 
      letter of 5/29 sent to Ms. Lewis






-
          
      




Commented on the retention of historic 
      preservation






-
          
      




Community will not compromise.


The community did not resist the project sponsor's desire to redevelop 
      this site; they did not demand the retention of the existing building






-
          
      




Project sponsor had conceptions, 
      and maintained a substantial part of the building


 
(+) Paul Duchscherer, Architectural 
      historian






-
          
      




Its is important to know in what 
      context the house was built

The faÃ§ade in the current position 
      was part of the integrity of the streetscape
 


 
(+) Felix Smith






-
          
      




This sound like a demolition, it 
      is a violation of the instruction of this Commission
 


 
(+) Lucia Bogatay


-
 
This commission should uphold the decision 
      of the previous Board, which in her reading
 
required substantial retention of the building, not a substantial 
      retention of the front of the building

They should hire an architectural preservation specialist


 
(+) Will Prague

      One of the problems we have with dealing with a lot of projects coming through 
      Planning and Building is the definition of terms






-
          
      



      What is a faÃ§ade? Is it an architectural treatment or is it structuraly 
      part of the building?

      Moving this faÃ§ade is not necessary to accommodate the construction of the 
      3 expensive condominiums that have been proposed

Moving the faÃ§ade would destroy 
      the character of the neighborhood






-
          
      




Several homes in the area that have 
      done remodeling have kept totally within the character of the neighborhood.


This particular project does not preserve the character or the architecture 
      of the rest of the homes in that block

-
          
      



      The Commission and the neighborhood agreed to support a variance that would 
      benefit the sponsor, allowing him to build deep into the lot.

In the course of his work he has 
      to evaluate historic buildings sometimes--deciding whether they have local,

As he traveles he has gained more prospective about San Francisco 
      Victorians.
 
There is not another 
      city made of wood.
 
San Francisco 
      is very unique in the Country because many of our houses was/is made out

The retained portion 
      of the house (shall) be restored to Secretary of the Interior standards

4038 17TH STREET
 - north side between Castro and Douglass 
      Streets; Lot 011 in Assessor's Block 2623 in an RH‑3 (Residential, 
      House, Three‑Family) District and a 40‑X Height and Bulk District.
 
REAR YARD VARIANCE SOUGHT: Subject to Discretionary Review by the 
      Planning Commission, the current proposal is to alter an existing vacant 
      one‑story over garage, single‑family dwelling by remodeling 
      it into a three‑story over garage, three‑family dwelling in 
      an RH‑3 (Residential, House, Three‑Family) District and a 40‑X 
      Height and Bulk District.
 
Note: This project was previously heard by 
      the Commission on April 6, 2000 and May 10, 2001, respectively. Following 
      public testimony on April 6, 2000, the Commission adopted a Motion to continue 
      indefinitely, so the Project Sponsor could develop a design that (1) does 
      not require demolition of the existing structure, (2) retains a substantial 
      portion of the front part of the Victorian house and (3) allows three units 
      to be constructed on the site. The revised project proposes to retain approximately 
      42 feet of the front of the existing building, which includes both exterior 
      side walls, and some of the interior walls. The existing facade would be 
      preserved and moved forward by approximately 3 feet 4 inches and lowered 
      by approximately 4 feet. The facade would be attached to a reinforced and 
      expanded structure constructed between its new location and the existing 
      portions of the sidewalls, which are to remain in place. The sidewalls would 
      be extended downward by approximately 4 feet and the 3‑foot 11‑inch 
      parapet would be removed. The revised project would further include building 
      additions above and behind the retained portion of the existing building, 
      resulting in a three‑story over garage, three‑family dwelling. 
      The revised project would also require the justification of a rear yard 
      variance which will be heard by the Zoning Administrator concurrently with 
      the discretionary review.




Section 136(c)(25) of the Planning Code allows enclosed and unenclosed 
      extensions of buildings, as permitted obstructions, to extend no more than 
      12 feet into the required open area, provided that the structure shall be 
      limited to a height not exceeding the floor level of the second floor of 
      occupancy, excluding the ground story, at the rear of the building on the 
      subject property, in which case the structure shall be no closer than 5 
      feet to any interior side lot line. Section 134(c) requires a minimum rear 
      yard of approximately 35 feet, measured from the mid‑point of the 
      rear property line for the subject lot. The new addition to be constructed 
      behind the retained portion of the front part of the existing building would 
      be three stories tall, extending 12 feet into the required rear yard to 
      be within approximately 33 feet 6 inches of the rear property line and would 
      encroach entirely into the required 5‑foot separation from the east 
      side lot line and from the west side lot line, respectively.
