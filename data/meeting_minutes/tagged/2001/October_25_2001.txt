BOS:
Re:  Housing, Transportation and Land Use Committee
- He appeared before the Housing, Transportation and Land Use Committee.  He was asked by Supervisor Maxwell to participate in this hearing regarding the Interim Controls.  Staff has completed an environmental review on this issue.  Supervisor Maxwell and Supervisor Daly continued the item at the call of the chair.  Basically, it was decided that the Planning Department take the lead in these Interim Controls.  A lot was accomplished at this meeting.
- There was a request by the Bicycle Coalition for a bicycle plan and Mr. Paul Maltzer was there to provide a status report.  Mr. Maltzer stated that in order to carry out some of the plan, an environmental report is necessary.  There were concerns from some of the members of the coalition.
- The committee will also be discussing the jobs housing linkage program.  I (The Director) was not able to stay for that in order to be here at the Planning Commission Hearing.
Re:  Sunshine Ordinance Task Force
- He attended this meeting along with Ms. Linda Avery, Commission Secretary, regarding two complaints.  One of these complaints was the way the Commission voted regarding 2258 Beach Street.  The Task Force continued this matter.  Staff was not able to comment or state their concerns.
- The other issue was a complaint of 176 Clipper Street where the department was mislead regarding an inaccurate and fraudulent notice as well as staff preventing a member of the public from speaking.  The Task Force felt that the department did not comply with the relevant legislation since the notice, which was mailed out for 311 notice was incorrect.  Although, another notice was sent out, all the recipients were not notified of this new notice.  The task force requested that the department re-notice and schedule another hearing.  Because of the fact that this case will be going before the Board of Appeals, he would like to have this process go forward.
BOA
Re:  1041 Lake Street
- The Commission took Discretionary Review on May 17, 2001 to approve an addition to a residential building.  The Commission voted to remove the 4th floor.  The board upheld the Commission's decision by a vote of +4-1.
Re:  144 Eddy Street
- There was an appeal to a letter of determination for 144 Eddy Street.  This building has been vacant for 20 years.  There was an argument from the Board of Appeals; this item was continued for 60 days in the hope that more affordable housing would be considered.

Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with conditions
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Ron Wallis – Project Architect – Representing the Owners
- The owners of the firm Northshore Resources also own several buildings in the City.  
- The restaurant space where Northshore Resources would like to move have had several names.  It has been vacant for periods of time because of remodeling.  Eventually the owners decided to give it up and sell the property.
- This proposal is consistent with the West Portal community.
(+) Deborah Udin – Sales Manager for Zephyr Real Estate
- She has managed several businesses on West Portal.
- The use of the real estate office would be a negative impact on the parking as opposed to a successful restaurant.
- The merchants are concerned about parking.
-          The use of the real estate office would be negative for the area.
(+) Olive Fox – Real Estate Broker – Fox and Fox Properties
- Her and her husband have been at this firm for more than 30 years.
- They patronize the merchants of West Portal.
- Together, they will be an asset and not a detriment to the residents.
- She has signatures of 21 of the merchants who support this proposal.
(+) Bill Drypolcher – Owner of Zephyr Real Estate
- They have proposed a merger with Fox and Fox and move intend to the 215 West Portal offices.
- This merger will allow an independent real estate office to become larger.
- They are trying to fight with the  big guys. 
- This larger space will accommodate more realtors.
- Parking is an issue but they have come up with several ideas:  1) they have approached one of the title companies on the street and they have given up one parking space.  They are trying to get two more from this title company; 2) they will get a parking sticker; 2) set up a model for outreach and several residents are willing to rent their garages.  They would like to leave the parking meters for their clients.
(+) David Cooperman, CPA
- There have been so few people going to the restaurant therefore the change of use is the best idea.
- He needs more space for his business.  
- He hopes that the Commission approves this proposal.

The subject property is an existing restaurant and bar ( Curve Bar and Restaurant') located in an M-2 (Heavy Industrial) Zoning District, a 105-F Height and Bulk District, a Mixed-Use Housing Zone, and the proposed Ballpark Vicinity SUD. 
                    Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and approve the project as proposed, with conditions.
SPEAKER(S):

- The neighbors support this proposal.
- This will be very good for the area.
(+) Jeffrey Leibovitz – Rincon Point South Beach CAC
- It is important that conditions be put on the operator.  There have been problems in the past and he hope that these conditions are clear to the operator.
- This sponsor will bring some life to the area.  He supports this proposal.
(+) Scott Durquin
-          It is great to have some entertainment after ball games.
(+) Scott Ruble

Upon approval of the conditional use authorization, the property owner shall maintain the main entrance to the building and all sidewalks abutting the subject property in a clean condition.

                    761 – 3RD  STREET - north corner of King Street, Lot 005 in Assessor’s Block 3794 - Mandatory Discretionary Review of an  Extended Hours Premises  Police Permit at an existing large fast food restaurant ( Happy Donuts'). The subject property is within the Ballpark Vicinity Special Use District (BVSUD), which allows large fast food restaurants (as defined by Planning Code Section 890.91) only as Conditional Uses. The existing facility was established prior to this requirement and thus is a nonconforming use (pursuant to Planning Code Sections 180 through 185). The proposal would allow the  facility to operate lawfully 24 hours each day and thus involves the intensification of an existing nonconforming use. While this proposal would ordinarily require Conditional Use Authorization, under Planning Commission Resolution Number 14844, all BVSUD controls are currently enforced with Discretionary Review powers. The property is located in an M-2 (Heavy Industrial) Zoning District, a 105-F Height and Bulk District, a Mixed-Use Housing Zone, and the proposed BVSUD. 
Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project as proposed.
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Man Lee
- He agrees with staff's report.
- He is available for questions.
(+) Jeffrey Lievobitz
- He supports this project.
(+) Terry Milne
- The conditions will be beneficial to the neighborhood.
- He is in agreement with this proposal.
ACTION:          Take Discretionary Review with the following condition:  Property Maintenance.

(-) Diana Bowen
- She has lived on Carolina Street for 9 years.  Her house is quite small.

- He hopes the plans can be modified someway.
(+) Joseph Bradford – Project Sponsor and Owner
- Some of the Planning issues are 1) demolition vs. remodel and 2) height and bulk of the building.
- He had neighborhood meetings for many months.  There were quite a few issues that he has addressed already.
- His building is the smallest on the block.  
- He believes that he has gone above and beyond and has revised the construction plans to something that is manageable for the neighborhood.
(+) Haley Parsons

- Their issues are:  1) building height at the rear of the building; 2) the uniqueness of the adjacent buildings is not respected; 3) there are no other houses that are built so disproportionately; 4) There will be an impact on light, air and temperature to their home; and 5) applicant has not acted in good faith to reach a compromise.
(+) Robert Mince – Representing project sponsor

- He has met several times with DR requestors to talk about their concerns.
- He performed a shadow study and found that there is minimal impact.
