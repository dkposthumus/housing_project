4.          Commission Matters
AVERY:  Reported that she represented the Commission at a meeting of the Sunshine Ordinance Task Force on Tuesday, 12.18.01. regarding two complaints filed by Mr. Bob Planthold.  The first complaint was that the Commission violated the Sunshine Ord., Sec 67.16 of the Administrative Code by failing to take a  roll call  vote on item 22 of the Commission's 9/13/01 calendar.  Since Sec. 67.16 of the Sunshine Ord. only requires the Commission Secretary to record in the minutes the roll call vote–not that the policy body actually has to take a roll call vote–the Task Force found the Planning Commission to be in violation of the  spirit  of the Ordinance.  The second complaint–that of a seriatim meeting between members of the Planning Commission during the hearing of item 22 on the Commission's 9/13/01 calendar–was withdrawn by Mr. Planthold for a lack of witnesses willing to come forward.

SAN FRANCISCO CRUISE TERMINAL MIXED-USE PROJECT AND BRANNAN STREET WHARF PROJECT - Public Hearing on the Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Report (SEIR). The proposed project would involve two components: 1) the construction of two berths (including necessary dredging) and a new terminal for cruise ships that call at the Port of San Francisco, as well as ancillary commercial development, all on Pier 30-32 (Block 9900, Lots 30 and 32); and 2) the construction of a residential project on Seawall Lot 330 (Block 3770, Lots 1 and 2, Block 3771, Lot 1), across the Embarcadero from Pier 30-32. The cruise terminal would contain about 100,000 gross square feet (gsf) of floor area, while the commercial element would include about 370,000 gsf of office space and about 220,000 gsf of retail/entertainment space. About 450 parking spaces would be provided on the pier. The residential component, on the block bounded by the Embarcadero and Beale and Bryant Streets, would include about 350 dwelling units and 350 parking spaces. The SEIR also analyzes a separate but related project involving the design and construction of the Brannan Street Wharf (Block 9900, Lots 34 and 36), a new, approximately 57,000-square-foot waterfront park along the Embarcadero just south of Pier 30-32.
