SPEAKER (S):


Fran Martin - Visitation Valley
Neighborhood Alliance 


- In February of 1999, Home Depot
announced that it would build a mega store in Visitation Valley.
 
The neighborhood decided to create it's own
planning department to deal with how this would threat the community.


- The opening of this mega store
would affect the neighborhood by creating more traffic and more pollution, the
affect on the Third Street Cal Train station as well as the total degradation
of the Valley.


- The Third Street Cal Train
station would be very important to the neighborhood.


- A survey was conducted and
various suggestions were made that were of importance to the neighborhood.
 
For example: a town center, housing,
daycare, an ESL extension for City College, neighborhood-serving stores, etc.


- She would like to have the
Neighborhoods 2002 plan be started.


Linda McKay


- She lives in Little Hollywood,
which is an area that is part of Visitation Valley.


- Visitation Valley is a gateway
for tourists to come into San Francisco from the Airport.


- This area is a border between
two cities: Brisbane and San Francisco.


- The area has spent 2 years
organizing the community.


- These are the reasons why this
neighborhood should be included in the Better Neighborhoods 2002.

SYCAMORE STREET
 -
 Lot 045 in
Assessor’s Block 3576, on Building Permit Application No.
2000.06.20.2307S.
 
Request for a
Discretionary Review for the construction of a new three-unit building in a
RH-3 zoning and 50-X height/bulk-zoning district.
 
The
proposal is to remove the two existing, one-story structures (one two-unit
building and one one-unit building) and to construct a new three-unit building
with three legally independent parking spaces, accessed from Sycamore Street in
a RH-3 zoning and 50-X height/bulk-zoning district.


Preliminary
Recommendation: 
Do not take Discretionary
Review and approve project as modified by applicant.


(Continued from
Regular Hearing of January 18, 2001)


 


SPEAKER (S):


(-) Rob Weedn


- Would like to ask for a
continuance of this project because not everyone in the neighborhood was aware
of the changes to the plans.


- This building is out of
character to the neighborhood.


- The neighborhood rental stock
will be lowered and rents will be raised throughout the neighborhood.


- Sunlight will be block to
various homes.


- There are various signatures on
a petition from neighbors who agree on taking Discretionary Review.


- The neighborhood character will
be changed.


- The second design is an
improvement but the structure is still too large.


- He recommends a 3-story building
and no condominium option.


(-) Christina Bar


- She has been a resident of the
Mission District for more than 4 years.


- Although technology has improved
the Bay Area, one should not forget about people who need to live in
communities.


- Although the current building
has no tenants and no one will be displaced, the new building will be too
large.
 
This will set a precedent for
larger buildings and will create higher rents in the area.


(-) Linda (last name unclear)


- She was born in the neighborhood
and has lived there all her life.


- The sunlight is the best thing
in her building.


- She has had many operations to
her back and hip and needs the sun because when it gets cold she has a lot of
pain.


- She is very concerned about the
height of the proposed building.


- She is very reasonable and some
of the changes made to the previous design are good but she would still like
the building to be modified to be lower.


(-) Ray Mascarenas


- He is one of the DR requestors.


- He owns a building on Sycamore
since 1968.


- He has lived on this block as a
tenant as well as a landlord.


- The proposed structure will be
out of character to the neighborhood.


- He would like to preserve the
cultural diversity of the neighborhood not have the building provide
condominiums.


- The small businesses will suffer
if the character of the neighborhood is changed.


- He would like the Commission to
approve Discretionary Review and modify the design of the building.


(+) Jerry Agusta


- He is the project sponsor.
 
His company, Buena Vista Builders is located
in the Mission, about a block a way from the proposed site.


- He considers himself a good
neighbor and a good builder.


- There have been many meetings
with the neighbors and there have been revisions done to the design of the
building.


- He bought the property and drug
dealers immediately used it and a crack house was established.


- He called the police many times.


- The building really should be
demolished and a new one constructed.


- Many buildings in the
neighborhood are 3 stories over garage.


- The neighborhood is congested;
therefore, he has allowed for up to 5 parking spaces in the building.


- He has filed a Notice of Special
Restrictions on the deed.


- He has been very considerate to
the neighborhood and asks for the project to be approved and not take
Discretionary Review.


(+) Jonathan Pearlman – Project
Architect


- He displayed drawings and
designs of the proposed structure.
