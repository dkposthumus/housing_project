                    436 CLEMENTINA STREET - Appeal of a Preliminary Negative Declaration: Assessor's Block 3732, Lot 62. The site is part of the major city block bounded by Howard Street to the north, Folsom Street to the south, 5th Street to the east, and 6th Street to the west within the South of Market neighborhood. Clementina and Tehama Streets are minor streets bisecting this city block. The proposed project would demolish the existing one-story, 5,000-square-foot warehouse on this 5,625-square-foot site and construct 28 residential condominium units over approximately 1,250 square feet (sq. ft.) of ground-floor commercial space, and eight off-street parking spaces within a new eight-story structure. The proposed structure would be approximately 37,975 sq. ft. and 85 feet in height, an increase of 32,348 sq. ft. and seven stories in height above the existing structure. The project site is located within the RSD (Residential Service Mixed-Use) zoning district and within the 40-X/85-B height and bulk district. Projects within the RSD zoning district require a conditional use authorization to determine the residential density for buildings over 40 feet in height. The project site is also within the South of Market Redevelopment Plan Area.
                    Preliminary Recommendation: Uphold Preliminary Negative Declaration.

SPEAKER(S):
Re:  Continuance
Erick Quesada – Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition
- There has been an enormous amount of community planning from both the Planning Department as well as residents of the Mission District.
- Any decisions should be waited on in order for the Commission to be briefed.
- It is really important to wait to hear cases located in this district and that this case be continued until after the briefing.
Cris Sielig – Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition
- She is also in agreement to continue projects which involve residents of the Mission District until the Commission has been briefed on the community planning in this area.
ACTION:          Because the project sponsor left after the initial action and was not present to hear and respond to comments made by members of the public, the Commission again continued this matter as it was proposed with the understanding that any request for further continuance could be addressed at that time.
AYES:          Bradford Bell, Antonini, Boyd, Feldstein, Hughes, S. Lee, W. Lee

4.          Commission Comments/Questions
Commission Secretary:
1)          For the record to be clear on how each Commissioner votes, she requested that Commissioners verbalize their vote clearly, raise their hand, or institute a roll call voting procedure.  (President Bradford Bell instructed that a roll call voting procedure be used from this point on.) 
2)          Recently, department staff went through what they thought was a general public meeting training session.  It turned out that the training session was really designed for Commissioners or Commissions.  The material provided to staff will be copied and forwarded to you.  If anyone is interested, I will arrange this training for you individually or as a body.
Commissioner Antonini:
- He made comments regarding the 4th and Freelon project.
- He would like to clarity that the Commission did not at any time discuss this project in regards to height or bulk, nor did they have any input from any of the neighbors.
- He understands that this case will be coming before the Commission in the future.
- He wanted to mention this to the public so that there are no misunderstandings that there is an approval of the project already.

Re:  Briefing Sessions
12/10/02 – Briefing on the General Plan and the San Francisco Wireless Telecommunications Facilities Siting Guidelines.
12/12/02 – Department's Citywide Action Plan which is a way of explaining how all of the long-range planning efforts are related to some common objectives and goals.
12/17/02  - Better Neighborhood's Programs which involve three areas of the City.
12/19/02 – Eastern Neighborhoods like the Industrial Zones, the areas that were subject to the Industrial Protection Zone policies and were under the greatest pressure to change:  Mission District, Showplace Square, SOMA, Visitation Valley and Bay View Hunter's Point.  This order is somewhat important.
1/9/02 – There are no briefings scheduled on this date.  This hearing will involve mostly action items.
1/16/02 – Presentation on various alternatives that are coming out of the eastern neighborhoods community planning workshops.  The Commission will make statements on preferences of alternatives in these areas.  This is tentative.

6.          Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Permit Appeals
BOS:
The full Board did not meet because of the Thanksgiving Holiday.
Re:  Finance Committee - Fourth and Freelon Special Use District Ordinance
- He transmitted the Commissions' comments on this project to the Committee.
- There will be some amendments made to this ordinance.
Re:  BOS hearing on December 9, 2002:
1) There is an appeal of a Conditional Use located at 2444 to 2454 Noriega Street and the authorization granted by the Director on October 17, 2002.  This case is scheduled to be heard by the Board of Supervisors on December 9, 2002.  The appellants feel the project is unnecessary and incompatible with the area.
2) Supervisor McGoldrick has scheduled two hearings before the Transportation and Commerce Committee on Thursday, December 12, 2002.  The first one will be to hear an update on the revised housing element of the General Plan and the second will be to hear the Citywide action plan.  That day is when the Commission will be briefed on the same subject so staff has asked to have this item continued.
Re:  Small Business Commission
- Staff will be attending the Small Business Commission on Monday evening, December 9, 2002, in Room 400.  The Department will be doing a presentation on the community planning process on the Eastern Neighborhoods and the impact on small businesses.  This is a non action item but staff will be there to answer questions.
BOA
- Craig Nikitas represented the Zoning Administrator and the Commission at the Board of Appeals.
- The previous Commission took Discretionary Review on 335 Country Club Drive in the Parkside District near the Zoo for a one-story house.  The proposal was for a 1,400 square foot (sf) addition to the second story.  The Commission took Discretionary Review and modified the project by reducing the size of the sf to 900 and made modifications to the entry design.  The permit was finally issued but was appealed.  The Board of Appeals overruled the Commission +4-1 and increased the size of the second floor addition to 1,100 sf.

Re:  Continuance
Jay Estey – Glen Park Merchants/Residence

- There is not enough information for Commissioners to make an informed decision--that is why he would like this case continued.
- There is also a sherette planned that will address the overall design for future development of this neighborhood.  This should be completed before this case is heard.
- There is data which needs to be submitted to the Commission as well as other issues that are still being manifested.
Chris van Loben Sels
- Further study would benefit the Commission's decision.  That is why they would like this case continued.
Andrea O'Leary 
- Her organization was left out of this process and she cannot believe that this case is proposed to be heard.
- This will impact them very much.
David Prowler – Representing Project Sponsor
- There are about 20 or 30 people here who have taken time off from work and are here to speak.
- There has been enough notice so he does not believe that people were not notified.
- He would like to ask that the Commission not continue this item.
Randy Lins
- He would like that this matter be continued and the sherette finished so that there is true public input.
- This issue is not right for determination yet.

- He knows that the sherette has not been completed.
- He would like to suggest that the sherette be completed before the hearing.
Susan Hildreth – San Francisco Public Library
- She is not in agreement with the continuance of this project.

Mark Zinky – Glen Park Neighborhood Group of Concerned Citizens
- He would like this hearing to be continued.
Re:  Merits of Case
(-) Gary Pike – Appellant
- He is opposing this project because it will cause traffic congestion, a deficit of parking spaces, and it will have adverse impacts on neighborhood retail, housing and character.  
- More than 600 people have signed petitions to reduce the size of this project.
- This project also does not comply with prop M
- Underground parking was also proposed but is not proposed anymore.
- There are various issues which still have not been addressed.  
- He hopes that the Commission will uphold the appeal.
(-) Chris Wheaton
- His specific concern is that there are quite a few underutilized sites around the Glen Park Marketplace area which may or may not have been focused on to determine whether they can be utilized to provide parking for the public that would be using the marketplace.
(-) Tom Huber
- He is opposed to this report because it inadequately addresses pedestrian safety.
- He displayed a video of a very dangerous intersection in the area.
(-) Dan Tuttle
- He believes that Glen Park will be a guinea pig for the transit-first policy.
- They submitted a request that this area have a thorough traffic analysis.  The response was that it was not necessary.

- BART is also working on the sherrette process.
(+) Tom McGuiguin
- This project can do a lot of good for the Glen Park area.
- Having a market as well as a library will create a community center.
