<<Project Start>>
1.          Commission questions/comments
Commissioner William Lee:
1) There was an item at the Board of Supervisor's hearing yesterday related to the past audit of the Planning Department and a proposal to set up an audit committee.  He would like the director to address this issue.  Do we really need an audit committee?
2) He would like to have a presentation by the Transportation Authority regarding transportation and funding requests for the next few years. There will be changes in the transportation industry as a result of Prop B.
He is requesting this presentation because many of the projects the Commission will be voting on will be impacted by this proposition.
Commissioner Antonini:
Re:  653 Duncan Street
-  He has a patient who is one of the Discretionary Review requestors.  He has checked with the City Attorney's office regarding this issue and they said that there are two tests to determine conflict:  1) if the fiduciary interest exceeds $500.00 in the last month, which it has not; 2) Does he feel objective about this case and the answer is yes.  He feels he can participate.  He wanted to bring this to the attention of the public with the understanding that he has done the research related to ethics.
C.          DIRECTOR'S REPORT
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
2.          Director's Announcements
Re:  Commissioner Lee's question
1) Supervisor McGoldrick introduced legislation that would create a task force for the Planning Department audit.  He thought it would be effective to create this task force.  
The Director responded to this legislation at the Transportation and Audits Committee hearing saying he would be willing to work with the Supervisor on this.
After yesterday's hearing before the Board of Supervisors, a task force is more than likely.  The Director will reserve his comments until he sees the information on this task force.  He will provide a copy of the audit and his response to the Commission.
Re:  Joint Hearing
There are proposed dates of January 23, 2003 or February 6, 2003 to have joint hearings with the Redevelopment Commission and/or the Transportation Authority.
The first hearing in January will provide information on when this joint hearing will take place.
Re:  Long-Range Planning
Supervisor Hall asked that departments that are involved in long-range planning provide information on how this information is used.

SPEAKER(S):
(-) Diane McCarney– 1st Discretionary Review Requestor
- She is against this third story addition because this project will cause serious impacts.
- There were serious impacts when the house was originally built.
- This building has been growing and has come before the Commission already.
- She displayed photographs of the proposed project and how it will impact the adjacent homes.
(-) Andre Srinivasan – 2nd Discretionary Review Requestor

(-) Pauline Shulman- Representing Elizabeth Dimas, 5th Discretionary Review Requestor
- She read a letter from Elizabeth Dimas who is opposed to this project.

(-) Doug Lockyer
- He does not live in the area but knows many people who live here.
- This structure has no sense of space.
- The shadows fall across the houses on the neighbors, it is not a backyard issue at all. 
(-) Michael Miller
- This property does not fit with the neighborhood at all.
- This addition just exacerbates the problem.
- He would like to encourage the developer to work with the neighbors.

- This structure will stick out from others in the neighborhood.
(+) Deborah Stein
- This is a classic example of neighbors asking the Commission to exercise it's extraordinary Discretionary Review powers not because of genuine land use conflicts but because of interpersonal conflicts.
- There have been many emotional neighbor versus neighbor conflicts.  The Discretionary Review requestors did not want this house to be built in 1995 yet appeals were not filed in time.

- This is an incredibly diverse neighborhood.
(+) Carolyn Goeldner
- She has 16 years experience as a residential broker.
- Since the building of this home, property values have increased and have improved.
- The proposed addition is within the scale of the neighborhood.  She urges the Commission to approve this modest addition.
(+) Roberta Boomer
- The project sponsors have met the required notices to the neighbors.  The project sponsors have done everything correctly.
- All the homes in the neighborhood vary in design.
- The project sponsors should not be penalized because staff told them where to construct their home relative to the Planning Code.
