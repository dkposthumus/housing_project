          21.          2000.1164ECD                   (J. NAVARRETE: 415 558-5975)
                    1880 MISSION STREET - Appeal of a Preliminary Negative Declaration. On Assessors Block 3547, on Lots 2A, 3, 4, and 29, the existing site is approximately 51,888 square feet in size and contains two existing buildings containing warehouse use and printing plant with offices.  The proposal is to demolish the two existing buildings and construct one six-story plus two-level basement building containing 183 dwelling units and 25,811 square feet (sf) of commercial space (retail and office).  The project would include approximately 218 underground parking spaces to be used for both residential and commercial uses.  The project site is located in a Heavy Commercial (C-M) zoning district, within a 65-B/50-X height/bulk district.  Conditional Use authorization would be required for a Planned Unit Development, for dwelling units in a C-M zoning district, for a bulk exception and because the project proposes to provide less than 25% of its housing units as affordable housing.
                    Preliminary Recommendation: Uphold Preliminary Negative Declaration.

- He considers people that live in and around the areas that are impacted by any development as part of the environment.
(-) Bernard Shirtser
- He lives between 16th Street and Mission.
- He is against this project because it is a  condo castle  and because the residents of the area cannot afford to live there.
