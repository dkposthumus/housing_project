6.          Director's Announcements
Re:  Welcome back
Welcomed Commissioners back after the holidays.
Re:  Planning Budget
- Will be preparing a work program, which will include a budget that will show how fees will be received.
- This process will end in February.
- After input from the Commission, this work program will be presented to the Mayor. 
- The Board of Supervisors has created a much more accelerated process for this.
- The department will develop a work program around a budget that will include at least a $2-3 million difference in what the department was funded last year.
- It will be quite a challenge to try to do all that is expected of the department with less.
Re:  Absence of Commissioner Salinas
- Commissioner Salinas broke his leg in an accident at home.
- We will miss him today and hope he recovers quickly.

7.          Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
BOS
Re:  1101 O'Farrel Street Proposal
- The board voted +9 -2 to allowe a map change that provides for a greater height and greater bulk.
Re:  Industrial Protection Zone for Bayview
- The Board without much discussion unanimously adopted this.
BOA
Re:  2252 Beach Street
- The Director attended the BOA hearing last night regarding this case.
- The BOA heard this case in December 2001 at which time they proposed a second alternative design to the one this Commission decided on.
- The BOA voted +3 -1 to approve the amended design.  Because they needed four (4) votes to overturn the Commission, their vote resulted in the Commission's decision being upheld.
Re:  144 Eddy Street 
- This proposal is a residential hotel that had been vacant for 20 years.  The project sponsor took out permits to renovate the hotel and never informed the department that it had been vacant.  The zoning would not allow a tourist hotel.
- The ZA determined that the tourist hotel had been abandoned and that it could be used as a residential hotel.
- The Board upheld him +3 -2.  This is in the North of Market Special Use District.  It was an important victory for the preservation of affordable housing--and the most important kind of affordable housing in many ways because it is single room occupancy hotels that are affordable to the lowest income levels.
RE:  1600 Mission Street
- There is a rotating sign there.
- The ZA determined that the permits were unclear.  An entire billboard that rotates is not permitted under the code.  Elements of a billboard can rotate but not the entire billboard.
- The BOA upheld the ZA and said that rotating billboards are not allowed in the City.
- There will a clarification to make it extremely clear so that there is no ambiguity.
Re:  290 Union Street
- This proposal was approved before the Commission in 1997.
- The building was built out, but it was built two feet higher than the Certificate of Appropriateness allowed.
- A Discretionary Review was filed on the alteration permits and this was before the Commission again this past summer.
- The Commission approved the modifications and the modified certificate of appropriateness.
- The BOA upheld the Commission's decision +4-0 and determined that 24 inches beyond a permit is not in substantial compliance and need to file a new certificate of appropriateness and follow the directions of the Commission.
Re:  Community Planning Process
- At the next hearing under Director's Report, there will be a status report on this process that will begin in February.

          2324 - 2340 CHESTNUT STREET - north side, between Scott and Divisadero Streets, Lots 12 and 14 in Assessor's Block 929 - Request for Conditional Use Authorization under Planning Code Sections 121.1, 121.2, 303, 711.11, 711.21 and 711.27 to exceed the permitted lot size of 9,999 square feet by approximately 7,500 square feet for a total lot size of approximately 17,501 square feet and the permitted use size of 3,999 gross square feet for the expansion of an existing personal service use (Gorilla Sports) from approximately 11,700 gross square feet to approximately 22,700 gross square feet, and to allow hours of operation to commence prior to 6:00 a.m. (5:30 a.m. proposed) in an NC-2 (Small-Scale Neighborhood Commercial District) and a 40-X Height and Bulk District. The proposal is to incorporate the Presidio Theatre space (approximately 11,000 gross square feet) at 2340 Chestnut Street with the existing Gorilla Sports space (approximately 11,700 gross square feet) at 2324 Chestnut Street.  The conversion of use of the theatre space would involve removal of theatre seating, interior alterations as well as exterior alterations consisting of the provision of two ingress/egress doorways connecting the two buildings. The existing retail spaces at the front of the Presidio Theatre would be retained.
Preliminary Recommendation:  Approval with Conditions
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Sandra De St. Phalle
- She opposes the conversion of the theatre to an exercise facility since the theatre should be preserved.
- A venue for independent films is very important in San Francisco.
(+) Ted Nasser – Consolidated Theatre Inc.
- Gorilla Sports has been very sensitive to preserving various aspects of the Alhambra Theater.
- He believes that Gorilla Sports will be a very good tenant.
(-) Alfonso Felder
- The most important part of this is to keep the use of the theatre.
- There is a gym already on this street yet what Gorilla is proposing will remove another good use in this City.
- He hopes that all creative uses are considered before the Commission approves it.
(-) Scott Weaver
- He is against this conversion because the Presidio has character and this will destroy this neighborhood character.
- He hopes that the Commission does in-depth investigation and research.
- There are already various gyms in the area.
(-) Rona Robrig
- The Marina District has more gyms per capita than any other district in San Francisco.
- She hopes that the Commission will not approve this conversion.
(+) Kathleen Havlehan – Heaven Day Spa
- She supports Gorilla Sports expanding.
- She lives in the neighborhood and would like to have a business come in that is already thriving and exciting in other areas of the City.
(+) Ray Greggains – Physical Education Chairperson at Lincoln High School
- Because of the generosity of Gorilla Sports, Lincoln High School has been able to thrive in sports education and activities.
- They have donated generous amounts of money to improve the sports program and have also donated sports machines.
- He hopes that the Commission will approve this conversion.
(-) Tara Dale
- She would like the theatre to remain a theatre.
- It is an important place and the theatre should stay there.
- She is against this conversion.
(+) Vegas Jenkins
- He has been involved with the independent filmmakers.
- He is not against this conversion since it will allow the  independents' to show their work.
- It is hard for independent filmmakers to get into festivals so this provides an opportunity for independent films to be shown.
(-) Myriam Oliven
- She is so angry that the sign was not posted yet there are so many people here to speak on this project.
- She is against this conversion since this neighborhood should not be destroyed.
- She is a member of a gym in the Presidio since there are various gyms in the area.
(-) Patricia Voughey
- A continuation date of March 14, 2002 is fine with her.
(-) Rancy Roselini – Golden Gate Palotis
- She is opposed to the destruction of a beautiful theatre.
- She hopes that the Commission adheres to the zoning of this area.
(-) Greg Hanson – Cow Hollow Neighborhood
- This neighborhood has already rejected the chain businesses.
- He is opposed to this conversion since it will take away the only theatre left in the neighborhood but there are various gyms to choose from.
(+) Tito Biancci – Owner of the Presidio Theatre
- His family has owned the Presidio Theatre for over 40 years.
- Their best tenants have been the Century Theatres yet they were not able to renew their lease.
- There is just nobody out there who could afford a single film theatre.
- He feels that Gorilla Sports lease would give them an opportunity to preserve a building that was built pre-1906.  
- He feels this is a win-win situation.
(-) Ted Segal
- He is opposed to this conversion since it will cause an impact on parking in the neighborhood.
- He would like to have the Commission take time to consider this proposal more.  
- Allowing the gym would be an easy way out.

                    888 HOWARD STREET - Certification of a Final Environmental Impact Report (EIR).  The project, which has been revised, is the proposed construction of a 33-story, 340-foot tall hotel building of approximately 487,900 square feet with one level of below-grade parking on the northeast corner of Fifth and Howard Streets (Assessor's Block 3724, Lot 66).  The revisions to the original project and associated environmental effects are set out in the Summary of Comments and Responses – Section B. The 37,860 sq.ft. site contains an existing surface parking lot with landscaping which is used by the adjacent Wells Fargo Data Center.  The revised project would contain about 600 hotel rooms along with ancillary support uses such as meeting rooms, restaurants, and retail space (the originally proposed 60 to 70 residential condominiums have been eliminated). The hotel entryway would be on Howard St.  There are three loading docks planned with entrances from Fifth Street.  The site is located in the South of Market area within the C-3-S (Downtown Commercial Support) District and the 160-F Height and Bulk District.

375 LAGUNA HONDA BOULEVARD - LAGUNA HONDA HOSPITAL REPLACEMENT - Public Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Report.  The proposed project is the demolition and replacement of some of the existing facilities at the Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center, located on the western slopes of Twin Peaks in central San Francisco, and additional site improvements.  The project includes: 1) demolition of all existing hospital facilities except the front wings of the Main Hospital Building; 2) construction of four new hospital buildings; 3) construction of an assisted living facility; and 4) expansion of existing outpatient programs and services.  The new buildings plus the retained building area would total about 987,000 gross square feet (gsf) (approximately 282,500 gsf more than the existing building area) and would accommodate 1,200 hospital beds (about 135 more beds than are provided at the existing hospital), plus 140 assisted living beds.  The new hospital buildings would range from 4 to 7 stories tall, with heights up to about 86.5 feet.  A total of 655 off-street parking spaces would be provided, an increase of 52 spaces above existing capacity.  Off-street loading facilities would be consolidated into 11 loading spaces, about half the existing supply.  The project site, which encompasses most of Assessor’s Block 2842, Lot 7, is zoned P (Public Use) and is within two height and bulk districts:  80-D and OS (Open Space).  The project may require a Zoning Map Amendment and a General Plan Amendment, and would require Conditional Use authorization.  The 62-acre hospital campus, which is owned by the City and County of San Francisco, has been determined to be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) as an historic district and contains two buildings that appear eligible for NRHP listing as individually significant. Note:  Written comments will be received at the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m. on January 16, 2002.
Preliminary Recommendation:  Public Hearing Only.  No Action Required
SPEAKER(S):
(-) John Balestreri – Director of the Forest Hill Assocation
- He is against this project since the neighbors are concerned that there will be construction traffic that will cause problems.
(-) Katie Balestreri – Member of the Dewey Circle Beautification Project
- They work hard to enhance the beauty and quality of life in this neighborhood.
- She is concerned with the heavy construction trucks that will be coming into the neighborhood.
(-) Roger Ridgeway – Pastor of the St. John's United Church of Christ
- They do not oppose the project.  His issues relate to how serious their (the neighborhood's) input has been taken into consideration.
- There have been various communications (from the neighborhood) with planning staff that have not been included in the EIR.
- This EIR should be corrected simply because it should be the norm of responsible planning.
(-) Gene Burbank – St. John's Local Organizing Committee
- His concerns are about omissions in the Draft EIR related to traffic problems and that the project is poorly described.
- These omissions should be corrected.
(-) Corneia Sapiru – St. John's Local Organizing Committee
- She believes that the Draft EIR does not deal with traffic issues.
(-) Steve Suacci – St. John's Local Organizing Committee
- His concerns with this Draft EIR relate to transportation circulation, parking and traffic.
(-) Richard Parrino – St. John's Local Organizing Committee
- He does not agree and is concerned with the major construction impacts on the surrounding neighborhoods stated in the Draft EIR.
(-) Ann Wharton – St. John's Local Organizing Committee
- Her concern is about YGC being built here.
(-) Eileen Fanelli – St. John's Local Organizing Committee
- Several members of her community have spoken and expressed their concerns and issues regarding the EIR.
- They believe that the lack of a public scooping meeting, the failure of the EIR to reference St. John's and St. Brendan's Local Organizing Committee's written and verbal comments, and the failure to provide a detailed description of the project's scope all violate the spirit and legal intent of CEQA.  The EIR, therefore, is incomplete.
(-) Deborah Wald
- She is very concerned about the actual construction process and the quality of life that will affect her and her neighbors.
- She lives right next door to the hospital and is concerned about the YGC construction, reservoirs construction, and the noise impact of these.
(-) John Paul
- He owns property next to the hospital.
- He believes that the EIR does not correctly inform the public about this project.
(-) Father Sarkis Petoyan – St. John's Armenian Church
- He is opposed to this project.
(-) Solange Bernard–Berg
- She is opposed to this project.

                    1654 KIRKWOOD AVENUE - northeast side between Phelps and Newhall Streets; Lots 17 and 18 in Assessor’s Block 5279 - Request for rear yard, parking and front setback variances.   Planning Code Section 134(a)(2) requires a rear yard of 45 percent the depth of a lot subject to reduction to a minimum of 25 percent, based on conditions on adjacent lots or 44 percent (44 feet) for the subject lot.
