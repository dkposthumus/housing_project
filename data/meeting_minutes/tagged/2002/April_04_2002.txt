724-730 VAN NESS AVENUE - Appeal of Preliminary Negative Declaration. The proposed project involves the demolition of two existing one-story buildings at 724-730 Van Ness Avenue and 650-660 Turk Street, and the construction of a new building consisting of an approximately 130-foot tall, 14-story tower fronting on Van Ness Avenue and a 67-foot tall, 7-story tower fronting on Turk Street above a two-level subsurface parking garage and ground floor retail space, accessory office and recreation/laundry room.  The project site is located on Lots 4 and 8 in Assessor's Block 742.  The vacant 724 Van Ness Avenue building was formerly occupied by about 4,500 square feet of retail space. At  730 Van Ness Avenue, there currently exists about 1,500 square feet of restaurant space.  The existing structure at 650-660 Turk contains 9,750 square feet and is currently occupied by an auto repair business at street level and an auto glass repair shop at the mezzanine level.  The new building would consist of about 134 dwelling units on floor levels 2 through 14 with lobby access from Van Ness Avenue, 45 independently-accessible parking spaces for the dwelling units on two parking levels with vehicular access from Turk Street, and ground floor space allocated to an approximately 1,530 square foot community/laundry room, about 830 square feet of office space accessory to the residential complex, and about 2,200 square feet of retail space.  Both project site lots are within a RC-4 District (Residential-Commercial Combined District, High-Density District) and the Van Ness Avenue Special Use District (SUD) as well as a 130-V Height and Bulk District.  The project would require Conditional Use authorization for new construction over 40 feet in height. The project sponsor would also need to seek Variances regarding off-street parking and loading requirements and for the height of of the mechanical penthouse on the tower which fronts Van Ness Avenue.

                    Re:  Planning Department Audit
                    The draft audit is out and the department is reviewing it for accuracy.  The audit will be available on April 15 to the Board of Supervisors as well as the public.  There will be a hearing sometime thereafter to discuss this with the Commission.
                    Re 427 31st Avenue - antenna
                    This case will be heard by the Board of Supervisors on April 8, 2002.
                    Transportation and Commerce Committee
                    Re:   Work Program and Budget
                    - Staff was present at this hearing to respond to their request to discuss the results of the current fiscal year's work program and budget.
                    - The Board is finally getting educated regarding the budget process.  They have requested that they be given an opportunity to help shape the goals and objectives of the Department's work program. 
                    - The Committee also took issue that once a budget decision is made; the Department has the opportunity to reshape the work program.  The Committee was surprised by this and raised a lot of questions.
                    - It is not easy to start a work program in January and forecast what the work program will be and what it will cost and then in June make a decision that will fall short.
                    - Staff suggested that this should be done through a public hearing which would allow the Commission as well as the public to come to the hearing and provide their input.
                    Re:  Inclusionary Housing Policy
                    - At the end of 45 days, staff was to come before the Commission with a presentation about some proformas of various examples of projects that would be subject to inclusionary housing.  Today was the target date.
                    - The ordinance that was before the Commission, which was not approved by the Commission but approved by the Board of Supervisors, supercedes the Commission's policy.
                    - Director Green will discuss with the Commission President as to whether or not it is necessary to bring this before the Commission.

                    Re:  148 7th Avenue

268 CHENERY STREET - northwest side of the street between Fairmount and Miguel Streets, Lot 012 in Assessor's Block 6685 - Request for Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application No. 2001/08/10/5766, proposing to construct a two-story rear horizontal addition on a duplex building, located in a RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation:  Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the Building Permit
                    (Continued from Regular Meeting of February 28, 2002)
SPEAKER(S):
(-) David Trip – Discretionary Review Requestor
- He purchased his property in 2000.  When he did, he approached his neighbors regarding the addition to his home.
- The home had been vacant for 12 years and had not been kept up so it needed extensive remodeling just to be habitable.
- He then made several modifications to the plan to deal with the issues of his neighbors.
- His issue with the project sponsor is that the extension is not within the existing footprint but extends further out.
- He is not objecting to the blocking of his view but the reduction of natural light and space to the back yard.
(-) Aaron Kahn
- He lives on Whitney Street, which is a home behind the DR requestor's home.
- He is opposed to the addition because it is out of character with the rest of the neighborhood and it is what the residential design guidelines intend to prevent.
- Although the house is not out of character with the one recently built, it is out of character with the rest of the homes.
(-) Kay Laming
- She lives on Chenery Street, next door to the project sponsor.
- She opposed the first addition since the height of the building and the large windows would intrude into her privacy.
- She is also opposed to the addition since it would set a precedent for any other additions similar in height.
- Now the Discretionary Review requestor is planning an addition that is also large in height thanks to the precedent set by the first addition of another neighbor.
- The project should not be as tall or extended as far out into the rear yard since the neighbors have been violated of their privacy already.
(-) Paul Curtis
- He lives in the neighborhood.
- He is concerned that this is another major addition in the area.
- His main objection is that the proposed construction is not compatible with the neighborhood.
(-) Susan Sampson
- She lives in the neighborhood.
- She read a letter from a neighbor who is opposed to this project.
- She has been in her house for 28 years and has rehabilitated her house and has not changed the look of her home.
- She is opposed of this project.
(+) Zahid Sardar – Project Sponsor
- He has lived in his property for 18 years.
- The addition has been reduced in form in order to create a series of small structures rather than one very large one.
- The homes in the neighborhood have a different character.
(+) Yves Behar - Designer
- Read a letter from a neighbor who is in support of the project.
- He believes that it is reasonable to expect change.
- He urges the Commission to approve the project.
- He believes also that architects should be supported.
(+) Jim Zack
- He lives on Chenery Street
- He supports this project.
(+) Mark Macy – Jensen & Macy Architects
