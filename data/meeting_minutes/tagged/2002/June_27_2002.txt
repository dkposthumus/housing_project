5.          Commission Matters
Commission Secretary:
1) Commissioner Fay was not able to come to the hearing today because of a family emergency.
2) I received a call from Supervisor Amiano's office just prior to this meeting, informing me that the confirmation hearing scheduled before the Board of Supervisors to consider the recommended nominees to the Planning Commission will not take place as scheduled on July 8, 2002.  Please note however that the public hearing schedule before the Rules Committee regarding this same subject will take place on July 2, 2002.  If at least a quorum (four members) is not confirmed and sworn in prior to July 11, the Planning Commission hearing for July 11, 2002 will have to be cancelled.  I bring this to your attention because it does affect items one and two on this calendar and may have some impact on other items as we move forward in the meeting today.
Commissioner Theoharis:
1) She received a letter from Bruce Selby of Lakeshore Acres.  The neighbors are concerned about Albertson's deli section being expanded.  Their concerns are:  a) that they have permits; and b) if it will be considered fast food.  Also, it seems there is now a proposed McDonald's where Boston Market is located.  She would like to know if there is enough evidence or cause for a hearing to determine if they are following the provisions of their conditional use.  Can a planner call Mr. Selby and Mr. Quiancini to follow up?
2) Thanked the Mayor for coming today.  It has been an honor and a privilege for her to serve on this Commission.  She thanked staff for all their support while she has been on the Commission.
Commissioner Salinas:
He also thanked the Mayor and this administration for the opportunity to be a part of this Commission.  He also thanked his fellow Commissioners.
Commissioner Chinchilla:
Although commissioners have not always agreed, it has been a pleasure to serve on this Commission.  It has been an honor to serve San Francisco.
Commissioner Lim:
It has been tremendous fun to serve on this Commission.  The most important thing is that all the Commissioners are very dedicated to making this City a better place.
Commissioner Baltimore:
She thanked the Mayor.  She has enjoyed working and getting to know her fellow Commissioners.  She has obtained a better understanding of this City.
Commissioner Joe:
She also thanked the Mayor, her fellow commissioners, and the staff of the Planning Department.

7.          Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
                    BOS:
Re:  Cruise Terminal – Environmental Impact Report Appeal
- The Commission certified an EIR that was appealed to the Board of Supervisors.  The Board upheld the appeal of this environmental document.
- The issue was the discharge impact from cruise ships – the ballast water discharge.  The EIR was remanded back to the Department to ensure that environmental planners respond to this issue.  Subsequently, the document will be back before the Commission for consideration and that document will be sent back to the Board of Supervisors for their consideration.
Re:  Budget Committee
- On Tuesday, there was an amended report from the Budget Analyst.  Instead of eliminating the Planner 5 position and demoting some of the Planner 4 Environmental positions, they would now only be affected through attrition.  Only if and/or when the people currently in these positions retire or leave would these positions be eliminated or reduced in class status.  Another amendment was that instead of eliminating a Planner 3 position assigned to Neighborhood Planning, the position would be reassigned to an area where the workload and need is greater.  
- We are also working with the Board of Supervisors to have the Planning Department's fees adjusted.
                    BOA – No Report Given.
D.          PUBLIC COMMENT ON AGENDA ITEMS WHERE THE PUBLIC HEARING HAS BEEN CLOSED
At this time, members of the public who wish to address the Commission on agenda items that have already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing must do so at this time.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.

- He does not believe that Walgreen's is very interested in acquiring this spot since during this hearing and the last one they have not had repesentation here.
(-) George Nasrah
- He is against this project because it will not require parking for Walgreen's.  He is co-owner of Daniel's Pharmacy and at one point they wanted to expand but were not allowed because parking was required.
(-) Carol Rooney
- She is against this project.  She believes that if this proposal were in Pacific Heights, the Commission would probably deny it.

- If he retains all existing retail, which is 3,000 square feet, Walgreen's would end up with less than 10,000 square feet because off-street loading is not required.  Walgreen's may come up with a plan for off-street loading.  If there were 10,000 square feet of retail, there would only be 2,800 square feet for frontage.  This is not proportionately right.
(+) Rebecca Silverberg – Excelsior District
- The association supports this project.
- There is a lot of open space already in the neighborhood.  
- She is concerned about parking for the residents of the housing.
(+) Karen Hemer - OMRA

- He has spent years trying to find out how to stop people from paving over their front yards.

                    LAGUNA HONDA HOSPITAL REPLACEMENT – Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report (EIR) prepared for the demolition and replacement of some of the existing facilities at the Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center and additional site improvements.  The project includes: 1) demolition of all existing hospital facilities except the front wings of the Main Hospital Building; 2) construction of four new hospital buildings; 3) construction of an assisted living facility; and 4) expansion of existing outpatient programs and services.  The new buildings plus the retained building area would total about 987,000 gross square feet (gsf) and would accommodate 1,200 hospital beds, plus 140 assisted living beds.  The new hospital buildings would range from 4 to 7 stories tall, with heights up to about 86.5 feet.  A total of 655 off-street parking spaces would be provided, an increase of 52 spaces above existing capacity.  Off-street loading facilities would be consolidated into 11 loading spaces, about half the existing supply.  The project site, which encompasses most of Assessor’s Block 2842, Lot 7, is zoned P (Public Use) and is within two height and bulk districts:  80-D and OS (Open Space).  The project requires a Zoning Map amendment and conditional use authorization.  The 62-acre hospital campus, which is owned by the City and County of San Francisco, has been determined to be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) as an historic district and contains two buildings that appear eligible for NRHP listing as individually significant.

The approximately 18,375-square-foot site is on the northwestern corner of Harrison Street and 23rd Street, in the block bordered by Treat Avenue, 22nd Street, Harrison Street, and 23rd Street.  The proposed project would involve the demolition of an approximately 21,126-gross-square-foot (gsf) one-story plus mezzanine light industrial and office building and construction of a four-story building consisting of 54 residential units with 60 off-street parking spaces.  The total floor area of the new building would be about 59,184 gsf.  The proposed building would be about 40 feet in height, about 11 feet taller than the existing building.

SPEAKER(S):
(-) Sue Hestor – Appellant

(-) Luis Granados – Mission Economic Development Corporation
- He believes that the Negative Declaration is inappropriate.
- Previous projects, which have been previously approved on a case-by-case basis, are not stated in the document.
- It does not take into consideration the Planning Department's rezoning of the area.
(+) Alice Barkley – Project Sponsor
- This environmental review document takes into consideration existing context, like live work, which has already been constructed.
- She urges the Commission to support the negative declaration.
(+) Judy West
- They spent over two years working on a rezoning effort for this neighborhood.
