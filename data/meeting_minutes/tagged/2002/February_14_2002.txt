          4.          Commission Matters
Commissioner Theoharis:  There was a newspaper article in the San Francisco Independent regarding her intentions to resign.  She feels that because of the article she has no choice but to answer Supervisor McGoldrick's concerns.  At the time she made the announcement, she was concerned about her health.  What has changed? Her health problems have gotten better.  Also, she is no longer president so there is much less stress in her life.  Another reason she decided to stay at the Commission is because when she made the announcement, there were so many phone calls and letters that were concerned about her leaving the Commission.  Articles like this can hurt many people.
Commissioner Chinchilla:  He is glad that Commissioner Theoharis has decided to stay on the Commission.  He agrees with Commissioner Theoharis that articles like this hurt many people and are quite irresponsible.

5.          Director's Announcements
Re:  Community Workshops
- On February 12, 2002, the second of a long series of community workshops was held at the ODC Theatre.  The Department as well as the community met regarding Mission District Interim Controls and the future zoning of the district.
- On February 13, there was a unique public session on the scoping of the Stonestown EIR.  Supervisor Hall assisted in putting together a meeting place and time.  The community met to discuss their desires to ensure that certain aspects were included in the environmental review process.  This is actually the first of its kind.
- On February 20, 2002, there will be another workshop in the South of Market area.  The Arc of Refuge was the location for the meeting but there is some problem with handicap access so the alternate location is the Recreation Center and as soon as information is final, the Department will announce it.

                    Preliminary Recommendation: Pending
                    (Continued from Regular Meeting of February 7, 2002)
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Joe O'Donaghue – Residential Builders
- He considers this legislation to hide the wrinkles 
- This proposal is flawed.
- With all due respect to the Department, this analysis needs to be done on a dollar per dollar, cost for cost proforma because banks are not going to take the risk.
(-) Sean Keighran– Residential Builders
- He is a small developer.
- Small developers are not allowed the luxury of hiring contractors to build their projects for them.  They are forced to build their projects with their own hands.  
- The lenders will not allow them to draw wages for their efforts.  Small builders end up paying the highest price per unit for the land.  
(-) Denis Carlin – Residential Builders
- He is a small contractor.
- He urges the Commission not to approve this legislation since it is not beneficial for him and small builders.
(-) Richie Hart – Residential Builders
- He is a small builder.
- This legislation will stop their project since they will not be able to afford to build.
- This legislation is flawed.
(-) Charles Richards
- He is a resident, a title insurer and an underwriter.
- There is risk if this legislation passes since loan agents really look at the applications of requestors.
(-) Kieran Buckley – Residential Builders
- He is a small business builder.
- This legislation will put him out of business as a small contractor.
(-) Robert Mellett – Residential Builders
- He read a letter from a person who could not attend the Commission who is against this legislation.
(-) Angus McCarthy – Residential Builders
- He is also a small builder.
- Most of the builders have lived in the City for many years and know it quite well.
- He will have to leave this City if this legislation passes.
(-) Joe Cassidy – Residential Builders
- He is a small builder.
- He has been building for about 25 years.
- He is against this legislation.
(-) Donna Crowder
- She is a realtor for Pacific Union Real Estate, and Director of the San Francisco and California Association of Realtors.
- She urges the Commission to encourage and not discourage more home building and rental housing.
(-) John Bardis
- This legislation will discourage the construction of housing and market rate housing in the City.
- It will drive out people who can build housing.
- The downtown developers shouldn't even have these requirements.
- We should not burden the market concept with this legislation.
- He hopes that the Commission will recommend to the Board of Supervisors not to pass this legislation.
ACTION:          Motion to Approve
AYES:          Joe, Lim, Salinas
NAYES:          Fay, Theoharis, Chinchilla

Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with modifications.
SPEAKER(S):
(-)Jim Chappell – President of SPUR
- This seems to be a down zoning measure masquerading as an environmental measure.
- This is not a small thing.  This is a massive change to the Planning code.  He finds it anti-housing and anti-schools.
- If this proceeds, it should have an EIR.
- This will also have an impact on housing production.
- This will affect where schools will be needed.
(-) Joe O'Donaghue – Residential Builders
- He has never seen a problem with shadows on schools in the City.
- This will impact housing projects and density problems.
- He believes that this needs to have further examination.
(-) Steve Vettel – Morrison and Forrester
- He believes that this legislation does not do the public good.
- If this legislation does go through, it needs amendments.
(-) Bob Passmore
- He is in agreement with everything that everyone has said.
- This legislation will cause problems with housing in the City.

YERBA BUENA CENTER REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AREA, 220 JESSIE STREET AND 606 FOLSOM STREET - Request under Planning Code Sections 302 and 340 for determination of consistency with the General Plan and with Section 101.1 of the Planning Code of a proposal to amend the General Plan Text and related Planning Code Text that will allow the transfer of development rights from properties of historical and/or architectural significance located within the Yerba Buena Center Redevelopment Project Area within underlying C-3-R (Downtown Retail) District or Districts designated by the Redevelopment Plan as C-3-O (SD) (Downtown Office Special Development) Districts, the "Transfer Lots") to "Development Lots" located in C-3-O (Downtown Office) District. The proposed General Plan Text Amendment would modify the language in Key Implementing Action II of Objective 12 of the Downtown Element of the General Plan. The Text Amendment to the General Plan would amend Section 128 (c)(1) of the Planning Code, which regulates the Transfer of Development Rights in C-3 (Downtown Commercial) Districts, to allow the transfer of TDR’s described above. The Office of Environmental Review has issued a General Rule of Exclusion, Case 01.1151E, in which the adoption of findings of consistency for the proposed General Plan Text Amendment and related Planning Code Text Amendments have been determined not to result in any significant environmental impacts since the limited nature of (1) the Text Amendment itself will have no environmental effect and (2) any project proposing to use TDR’s on a Development Lot will be subject to separate CEQA review.
Preliminary Recommendation:  Adoption
SPEAKER(S):
