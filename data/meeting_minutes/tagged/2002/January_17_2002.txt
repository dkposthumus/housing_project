1.          2001.0671E          (CHAN: 558-5982)
222 VALENCIA STREET – Assessor's block 3533, Lot 4. Appeal of Preliminary Negative Declaration.  The proposed project includes the construction of nine residential units, approximately 400 square feet (sq.ft.) of ground floor commercial space, and nine off-street parking spaces within a new five-story structure. The site is a fenced private parking lot for approximately 13 cars. A 780-square-foot warehouse is on this 4,590-sqare-foot site. The new building would be approximately 50 feet in height. Vehicular access to the site would be from Valencia Street. The project site is within the Board of Supervisors adopted Mission District Interim Controls. Under the controls, any change of use would require a Discretionary Review (DR) and all market rate housing that does not provide at least 25% affordable units on site would require a Conditional Use (CU) authorization.  Therefore, the project requires a DR and a CU. The project site is also within the study area of the proposed Upper Market Better Neighborhood 2002 Program. The project site is located within the C-M (Heavy Commercial) zoning district and within a 50-X Height and Bulk district. 
Preliminary Recommendation: Uphold Preliminary Negative Declaration

8.          Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
BOS
Re:  Appeal of Certification of EIR for De Young Museum
- After listening to further testimony from appellants, the Board upheld the Commission's decision by a +10-1 vote.
- The Board determined that the document the Commission certified was accurate and sufficient.
Re:  Conditional Use for an antenna at 2801 California Street
- The Board heard the appeal and after hearing testimony, the Board upheld the appeal and overturned the Commission's approval by a vote of +10-1.
- The Board felt that there was no need for this antenna, that customers of Sprint were still able to receive service.  Sprint felt that this site was necessary in order to improve service.
BOA
- The ZA thanked former president Theoharis and congratulated the new officers.
Re:  Commissioner Salinas
- Commissioner Salinas is doing better and hopes that he will be here for next Thursday's hearing.
Re: 176 Clipper Street
- The Commission did not take Discretionary Review on this project and approved it.
- The issues that were before the BOA:  1) the peak of the roof had been moved back approximately 7 inches for structural reasons.  This is different from what the Commission saw.  There was a concern that the building was within 6 inches of the rear yard; 2) there were concerns that the house was too large and that it was out of character. 
- The BOA upheld the Commission's decision with tow modifications:  1) The Planning Commission required obscured glass be placed in the windows that face the property line.  The BOA felt that obscured glass was not necessary since there were no transparent windows on the adjacent DR filer's property, only an obscured stained glass window.  2) There was a stairway that comes out from the third floor.  The project sponsor requested that there be a small roof over that.  The BOA agreed.
