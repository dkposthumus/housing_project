7.          Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
BOS – None
BOA 
January 30, 2002 Hearing:
Re:  760 El Camino Del Mar 
- The Board upheld the Commission's decision but made one minor change.
- The Commission had originally voted to design a setback on the upper floor to allow more light to the adjacent property's rear yard.  The Board decided that this was not necessary.
- The Board basically modified the material selection.
February 6, 2002 Hearing:
Re:          1209 Vicente Street
- This was a conditional use that was before the Commission on January 22, 1998 for the modification of a building; reduce the parking on the site; and to keep more of a retail frontage.
- A series of permits were issued, but the Building Department decided that keeping the existing building was not appropriate.  The Planning Department issued a building permit that, in general, complied with the decision of the Commission, but was new construction.  Unfortunately, the Planning Department in error issued another building permit that was 4 feet higher.  The neighbors appealed the demolition, the project sponsor, who had a new representative, recognized that this 4 foot addition was inappropriate, the Board of Appeals understood that, they upheld the demolition permit but stayed the demolition permit until a new building permit was issued.  In affect, the neighbors get the opportunity to look at the new building again.

8.          Consideration of amending the existing Planning Commission Inclusionary Housing Policies
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Commissioner Linda Richardson
- She supports the Director and Staff on this item.
- There are many elements that constrains housing in San Francisco.
- Incentives need to be provided to private developers as well as encourage non-profits.
- She also supports the True Hope project.
(+) Chris Cunnie – Representing the Police Officers Association
- He is working closely with the coalition, the community leaders and ministers of the City to represent 2,100 of his members.
- He is here to ask the Commission to support the off site exclusionary housing.
- Affordable housing for his members takes community policing to a new level.  
(+/-) Jamie Rossi – San Francisco Chamber of Commerce and Housing Action Coalition
- He commended the Commission for having done a great job on this policy.
- Yet he believes that it should help to influence the legislation that is going forward at the Board of Supervisors by Supervisor Leno.
- The inclusionary requirement should be a law not just a guideline.
- He also supports the True Hope Church of God and Union Property Capital.  This is a great example of what you can do when you put private capital with the current needs of San Francisco.
(+/-) Lynn Sedway – Sedway Group
- She has been engaged to analyze the feasibility of the inclusionary requirements.
- A lot of the scope was augmented to address the concerns and issues raised by the Planning Department.
- She does not agree with all the conclusions of this policy especially those that state that the inclusionary policy is feasible.  Although there are other conclusions she does agree with.
(+/-) Jim Chappell – President of SPUR
- For 5 years, their major program has been housing production and looking for ways to fund housing in the City.  He is also a member of the Housing Action Coalition, where 15 to 20 groups have been working for 2 years for inclusionary legislation.  This has resulted in legislation that is before the Board of Supervisor where there is wide-spread agreement by housing organizations.
- Although the Planning Department has been working hard on this, it is still policy and not legislation.
- He would like the Commission and the Planning Department to endorse the legislation that is before the Board of Supervisors.
(+/-) Rev. Arnold Townsend
- He realizes that there have been a lot of numbers being discussed but he is concerned with the real human effect on people who cannot afford to live here and have to leave.
- The Department has to be careful to not make requirements so high that developers don't build anything.  Then there will not be any inclusionary housing or market rate or any other kind.
- It was a good idea to bring this policy forward but more detail needs to be dedicated to it.
(+) Walter L. Johnson – San Francisco Labor Council
- He would like the Commission to please consider the proposal of Bay View Hope Housing.  It would be wrong to delay this project.
- He appreciates all the time and work dedicated by the department but there are special cases that require special attention.
(+) Rev. Ted Frazier – Voice of Pentecost Church
- He is encouraged with the progress that is being made in this area.
- There is a tremendous crisis in housing and we need creative approaches to solve the problem.
- He supports the project in Bay View Hunters Point.
(+) Tyrone Netters – Bay View Hope Project
- He is here to support the Bay View housing project.
- He also supports the Planning Department's policy
- He read a letter from a friend who would like to keep the inclusionary housing requirement for developers at 10 percent.
(+/-) Hazel Walker – Care and Restoration Inc.
- She appreciates the staff of the Planning Department and all the hard work related to this policy.
- Affordable housing is very much needed in this City and the Planning Commission has the power to do a better job and a more outstanding job in this City.
- She is concerned that the Bay View Housing Project will be delayed for another year.  She hopes that the Commission will not do that.
(-) Rev. Arelious Walker – Caring and Restoration Home
- He received faxes, e-mails, etc. from people who had seen the hearing held on the Bay View Housing Project and were very excited about it.  
- Recently he has been receiving information that this project will be delayed.
- The Commission has the authority today to make this decision and hopes that the Commission will not delay this project.
(-/+) Steve Atkinson – Steefel, Levitt and Weiss
- He will be speaking mostly about the policy's off site housing.
- There are several aspects of the policy that will limit off site housing.
- This will cause many projects to not be able to be built.
- Another issue in the policy is that it states delaying for at least a year to develop a housing credit transfer program.
- He urges the Commission to direct staff to work on the housing credit transfer program immediately.
(-/+) Tracy Dearman – Haight Street Mortgage Co.
- She knows that affordable housing is needed.
- She urges the Commission to allow the developers to meet their affordability requirement offsite and not stop developments.
(-) Marty Dalton – UDC
- He believes that part of the confusion is that recommendation 7 suggests they wait a year before they come up with policies to make affordable transferable credits available in the market.
- He hopes the Department will come up with some solutions to make these transferable credits happen.
(-) Gregory Richardson
- This is black history month and this will be an opportunity to show that the African-American community should stay alive.
(-) Rev. Larry D. James – New Liberation Church
- Even though there are so many numbers being discussed today, the bottom line here is people--people and people's lives.
(-) Bill Poland – Bay West Group
- He believes that the goals from the Planning Department are to retain the vibrant blend in San Francisco.  In order to retain this blend, affordable housing needs to be built.
- He believes that a different percentage needs to be decided upon in order to make this policy work.
(-) Gia Daniller – Jewish Community Relations Council
- She hopes that the Commission will not do anything that will have a detrimental effect on the 900 Gillman project.
- She thanks the Department for their efforts with the hope that the Commission will not diminish but increase an already shortage of housing in the City.
(-) Calvin Welch
- He supports the Department's recommendation on the Leno Legislation and the draft resolution except for the language of Exhibit B which calls for amendments to the Leno Legislation by increasing the amount of affordability level from 60 -- 100 percent to 80 -- 120 percent which are both in the proposed policies that Department staff is recommending to the Commission.
(-) Douglas Shoemaker – Non-Profit Housing Association
- He has been studying and looking at inclusionary housing policies in about 35 different cities in the Bay Area.
- The notion that San Francisco's inclusionary housing has produced so little housing units because the policy is so stringent is not really so because actually the policy is applied to so few projects.  He believes that the goal is to have a project go through the Planning Department as a permitted use with no Conditional Use requirement at all.  But with the security that the Commission will apply appropriate affordability standards to it.
(-) Jeffrey Heller – President, AIA
- He is here representing the AIA.
- He has a few cautions regarding this policy:  They have only achieved about 53 percent of the production of housing that is the target goal set by ABAG and others--and this is in the best of development times.
- There cannot have been excess unreasonable profits if we can't even meet the housing goals in developing housing in the best of times.  Development of housing is extremely difficult and the margins are extremely narrow and the production of housing projects is very difficult indeed.
- The AIA will be considering what has been put out today but he believes that they will be in agreement with SPUR and Calvin Welch.
(-) Peter Cohen – Board Member with the Green Belt Alliance and Hayes Valley Neighborhood Association
- Their mission is to advocate for more housing in San Francisco.
- They believe that San Francisco needs to increase its housing supply as well.  That the increased supply needs to be distributed to San Franciscans at various income levels.
- He encourages the Commission to approve the ordinance that is being sponsored by the Board of Supervisors.
- The Planning Department's analysis is very helpful and thorough and it is important to know that there is a collective will to address this need.
(-) Kim Grose – San Francisco Organizing Project
- She represents various churches that want to increase affordable housing in San Francisco.
- Housing needs to be as affordable as possible and that is why they support the Leno legislation.
(-) Gloria Hasbun – San Francisco Organizing Project - St. Charles Borromeo Church
- Spoke in Spanish.
- She has a problem at the apartment complex where she lives.
- The owner does not want to make any repairs to the apartment--both inside and out.
- Now the owner is selling the building and many of the tenants cannot find an affordable place to live.
- She hopes that the Commission will support them by supporting the Leno legislation.
(-) Antonia Carreno – San Francisco Organizing Project - St. Anthony's Church
- She hopes that the Commission will consider the Senior Citizens that have trouble finding a place to live.
- She is supporting Mark Leno's proposal.
(-/+) Supervisor Mark Leno
- He has been working closely with the Housing Coalition.
- There are for-profit developers, non-profit developers, affordable housing developers, advocates for transit, for the environment, for seniors, for the neighborhoods, bicycle coalition, chambers of commerce, etc.
- If we are going to double the amount of housing, let's make sure that we double the affordable part of it.
- He knows that the numbers are absolutes but there have been people who have provided good information.
- He would like to recognize the Coalition for having done most of the work for his legislation; his office has mostly been a facilitator.
(-) Tim Tosta – Steefel, Levitt and Weiss
- He would like to strike from today's conversation the notion of extraordinary profit.
- The other notion is that the money that could come here to be invested in San Francisco could go to another product type or another location.
(-) Robert Meyers – City Planning Consultant
- He surveyed inclusionary housing in other bay area cities.
- Most cities that have requirements only have a 10 percent maximum.
- Building housing in San Francisco is already difficult.
- Raising the requirements will make them out of step with their neighbors and will make it harder for them to meet the housing needs of the residents.
(-) Carlos Romero – Mission Housing Development Corporation
- He is concerned with the people who have been the most affected with displacement are the people that live in the southeastern section of the city; people in the Bayview, in the Mission and in SOMA.
- This policy will not help these folks.
- He urges the Commission to move forward with the Leno legislation.
(-) Clark Manus
- The 7 points of this policy is quite simple and he feels that this Commission and Supervisor Leno can actually put something in place instead of just talking about it.  The more they talk about it the more the opportunity is eluded.
(-) Valerie Tulier – Facilitator of the Latino Steering Committee
- She supports public/private ventures such as the True Hope project.
- The community determines it's own needs such as affordable housing and how to achieve it.
- People in the Latino community support the True Hope project.
- Affordable housing needs to be just that – affordable.
(-) Mary Murphy – Farella, Braum and Martel
- The proposal that Dr. Ghosh presented must clear the market and the solid evidence and solid date suggest that this proposal will not clear the market.  There are market realities that must be met.
(-) Oz Erickson – Emerald Fund
- He has some issues about this policy, for example:  raising the level to 14 percent for the conditional use. 
- He recommends that if the Commission is going to consider this, that the affordable component be reduced to 12 percent as opposed to 14 percent.
- He was impressed with the report since there was a lot of work that went into it.
(-) Ezra Mersey – Tishman Speyer
- The proposal today supports new housing and he respects the intent of the Planning Department for making sense of housing economics, he respectfully disagrees with various parts of the report.
- The reality is that it will either delay or halt production of inclusionary or market-rate housing in San Francisco.  Ten percent as of right, 12 percent conditional use should be the maximum inclusionary housing that high-rise development can sustain.
- The Leno legislation should be a guideline as policy.
(-) Rom Miguel – Planning Association for the Richmond
- This policy has to be feasible for developers otherwise nothing gets built.
- Create certainty; the code has to be the base.  Policies are great in allowing flexibility but this flexibility should be beyond the base.
- There has been a lack of production.
(-) Gabriel Metcaf – Deputy Director of SPUR
- He is here to speak in favor of the Leno housing legislation.
- He is not in total disagreement with the policy the Planning Department is presenting before the Commission.
(-) Sue Hestor
- What is item 8 about?
- There is legislation before the Commission that has gone through all of the reviews and is possible to adopt.
- One can't do anything with this.
(-) Joe O'Donaghue
- He is not in agreement with the policy presented by the Planning Department.
- He is more in agreement with the Leno legislation.
(-) Steve Vettel – Morrison & Forrester
- He urges the Commission to put forward the Leno legislation and support it as it is without corrections.
-          Various organizations, left and right, agree with the legislation.
(-) John Bardis
- The housing crisis has put San Francisco on the map.
- Why are constraints put on housing?
- Why don't we deal with the matter directly and build housing directly as a city.
- He urges the Commission to ask staff to come back and report on what happened to the housing policies today and show how those alternatives have failed compared to other alternates, including inclusionary housing policies.
(-) Marshall MacIntire
- He is a homeowner in San Francisco but he has also been a renter.
- Low income in San Francisco will not be done until everyone agrees that they want it and make sure that people living in this type of housing, actually need to live in this housing because of their income.
- This has to be done fairly.
ACTION:          Meeting held.  The President directed that the matter be brought back to the Commission on February 14, 2002 for action.

                    REVISION TO THE INSTITUTIONAL MASTER PLAN FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO LOCATED AT 2130 FULTON STREET - Consideration of revisions amending the Institutional Master Plan for the University of San Francisco.  Pursuant to Planning Code Section 304.5(d), a public hearing will be held to solicit public comment on any proposed revision to an Institutional Master Plan.  The University of San Francisco is proposing revisions to its existing Institutional Master Plan dated July 1993, including to incorporate plans to (1) convert the former Lincoln University Building at 281 Masonic Street to the University of San Francisco College of Professional Studies (This renovation has been completed.); (2) convert and expand the McLaren School of Business, including an addition of approximately 20,000 square feet and conversion of existing dormitory space to new offices and classrooms, and (3) locate childcare facilities within its existing buildings.  The purpose of this public hearing is to solicit public comments on the proposed revisions to this Institutional Master Plan only.  The Planning Commission will not approve or disapprove any individual construction projects related to these revisions to the Institutional Master Plan at this public hearing.
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Father Bob Nehoff 
- The purpose of this institutional master plan is to improve the campus environment and improve facilities.  The University has greatly improved the central open space of the campus by adding landscaping and relocating parking.  It created a new housing opportunity for students and staff, approximately 110 beds of student housing, a rehabilitated leased facility, a new Jesuit residence at Lone mountain and 136 units of faculty and staff housing which will be completed shortly.
- The most important of these improvements is the proposal to improve and expand the School of Business and Management.

Preliminary Recommendation:  Take Discretionary Review and approve with modifications.
SPEAKER(S):          
(-) Ruth Marion Anderson
- She is against this construction because it is too massive and it is not in keeping with the neighborhood.
- Her other concern is related to light being diminished.
(-) Paula Olacker
- This structure will affect the sun and light that comes into her unit.
- If this project is approved it will mean that from a window in her house she will be looking into a wall that blocks light into the room.
- It will also affect the value of her property.
- This will change the character of the neighborhood.
- This is a detriment to the neighborhood.
(-) Jeff Iarelo
- He is concerned about the value of his property.
- He is also concerned about the light and air that the neighborhood has.
- He would like the addition to be flush to the back of his house.
(-) Cathy (did not state last name)
- This project will affect her light and space tremendously.
(+) James Woods
- The proposed addition at the back would not affect the sky lights of the neighbors.
- He has always been prepared to solve the issues of his neighbors.
- He has neighbors who have signed documents supporting his project.
- He has a large family that comes to visit frequently and that is why he would like to add a 4th bedroom and because there are already three people living in the house.
- He hopes that the Commission will approve the project.
(+) Ellen Woods
- They purchased this home with the intention of it being their retirement home.
- She hopes that the Commission approves their application.
ACTION:          Take Discretionary Review and approve with the following modifications from staff:  1.

780-27TH STREET -north side of 27th Street between Douglass and Diamond Streets, Lot 014A in Assessor’s Block 6583 - Request for Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application No. 2001/06/11/1266, proposing to construct a third story vertical addition to the existing two story, single-family dwelling, located in a RH-1 (Residential, House, Single-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation:  Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the building permit as submitted. Take Discretionary Review and Approve the building with the recommended modifications.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Patrick Richards – Representing DR Requestor
- He hopes that the Commission will look at the compromise and why it is a good idea.
- The proposed home is just too bulky.
- The project sponsor is not a homeowner who wants to make an addition to his home, it is a developer who is making this big project at the cost of his neighbors.
- This project will also block the light and air on an open space that already exists.
(-) Bruce Bonacker – architect for DR requestor
- The project sponsor's building is already large.  This addition will make the building the largest in the neighborhood.
- On the first floor, we are proposing an alternative that pulls the rear of the building back 7 feet while maintaining the two bedrooms at the same dimensions.
- At the top floor, we would suggest pulling the master bedroom suite forward or south on the property so that it still maintains the design review guideline recommended 9 foot setback from the street.
- He is available for questions on the alternative proposal.
(-) Stan Padilla
- He and his wife live near the proposed construction.
- One of the issues important to him is that there has usually been a neighborhood spirit of inclusion and involvement that didn't happen here.
- He is concerned that the neighbors did not get an opportunity to discuss issues related to the proposed construction.
- He is also concerned that this project is not to benefit a family who will live there; this is a developer who will expand on this site (and leave).
- He is impacted by the size of this project.
(-) Jed Davies
- He lives on Douglass Street.
- They moved to this house because of the character of the neighborhood.
- This proposed extension of 25 feet is inappropriate and unfair.  It goes all the way across his property.
- This project will encase his property.
- He is only asking the Commission to direct the project sponsor to reduce the rear extension and reduce the third story roof.
(-) Vicky Rosen – President of Upper Noe Neighbors
- She does not live near the proposed project yet she is concerned with the huge homes that are being built near smaller homes.
- It is really important to do the right thing and scale down the project a little bit.
(+) John Hood – Project Architect – Hood Architects
- This project is in keeping with the general fabric of the neighborhood.
- His design is to mass the building towards the middle of the house in order to minimize the impact on the rear and from the front.
- Setting back the third floor from the street is meeting the guideline of maintaining scale from pedestrian level.
- He would like to have this project approved with recommendations from staff by reducing the height of the gable by 4 feet.
(+) Randy Cooper
- He has lived in this neighborhood for many years.
- He is not a developer.
- He has fixed up 5 homes in this neighborhood over a 15 year period and has lived in the homes over a period of 3 years each.
- His design will be compatible with the neighborhood.
- He is currently in a rental home.
ACTION:          Take Discretionary Review and approve with modifications based on the recommendations offered by the DR requestor’s architect.  The Zoning Administrator added to those recommendations by modifying the DR requestor’s proposal as follows:  1) on the first floor a five foot extension behind the east bedroom; 2) on the second floor a five foot extension behind the eastern portion of family room; and 3) a three foot extension on the third floor to the rear.  The Planning Commission declined to modify the height of the building from that proposed by the Project Sponsor
