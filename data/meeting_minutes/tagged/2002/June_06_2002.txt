Re:  Appeal of Conditional Use Authorization for the California Tennis Clubs
- The Commission approved this application by a vote of +4-2.

- The item was continued to June 17, 2002.
SPEAKER(S):
Patricia Vaughey
- She would like to clarify what happened at the meeting:  the argument was that the neighbors were saying that the tennis club was acting in bath faith.  
- In the 1987 case, the argument was that the parking was to be for the neighbors as well as the tennis club and they (the tennis club) never kept up to their promise.
