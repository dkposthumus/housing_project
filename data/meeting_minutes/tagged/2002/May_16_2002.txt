                    888 HOWARD STREET (aka 155 FIFTH STREET) - northeast corner of 5th  Street, Lot 66 in Assessor’s Block 3724 -- (1) Request for Determinations of Compliance under  Planning Code Section 309 (Downtown Project) and (2) Request for Exceptions, including an exception to the Reduction of Ground Level Wind Currents requirement (Section 148); (3) Request for Conditional Use authorization for a hotel, Planning Code Sections 303 and 216(b) and (4) Amendments to the Planning Code and Zoning Maps to change the height, bulk and Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of the project site, Planning Code Section 302(c) .  The proposal would change the height and bulk zoning of the project site from 160-F to 320-M, and would change the maximum FAR from 5:1 to 7.5:1 without the purchase of Transferable Development Rights (TDR).  (The current zoning allows a maximum FAR of 7.5:1, but only with the purchase of TDR).  The Project would also require amendments to the Urban Design and Land Use Elements of the General Plan and the Downtown Area Plan to be consistent with the proposed changes related to height, bulk and FAR. 
                    Preliminary Recommendations: Pending
                    Note: The project currently proposes to rezone to a 320-S height and bulk district, instead of a 320-M district as originally requested.

5.          Commission Matters
          Commissioner Salinas:  During the week, he received two calls regarding a case before the Commission last week.  His comments last week were not directed to the family who had their lives turned around especially when there is construction going on.  His comments were directed towards the professionals who had been hired and who had been given the trust by this family to look out for their interest.  His message is to please be careful when one hires professionals and look for references.  He does not want the professionals thinking that this Commission is a fail-safe mechanism.

                    BOS – 
Budget Committee
Re:  Release of $263,000--money that was on reserve mainly intended for capital improvement for the Department's computer system.
- It was a difficult hearing.  Director Green admirable represented the department and the needs.
- The money was released pending a quick review by the Department of Telecom munitions and Information Services.
- He believes that the period would be between three or four weeks until we are up and running.
                    BOA –
Re:  315 and 319 Edgehill Way
- The Commission took Discretionary Review and disapproved the project based on the following items:  1) because the project was on a very steep hill, the Commission was concerned about the soil stability; 2) character of the neighborhood; 3) scale of the house; 4) the driveway was 10 feet wide so it is very narrow.
- There was controversy on the permit streamlining act.
- The Board upheld the Commission +4-1 to allow construction.  The size of the houses was reduced; there was an open space easement, and there were street improvements prior to the start of construction.  The Board supported the Commissions decision to take Discretionary Review.
D.          PUBLIC COMMENT ON AGENDA ITEMS WHERE THE PUBLIC HEARING HAS BEEN CLOSED
At this time, members of the public who wish to address the Commission on agenda items that have already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing must do so at this time.

                    Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and approve parking with requirement to build dwelling units.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Petter Hatiarris – Representing the DR requestor
- The project sponsor has made representations to people that she needs access to my clients space in order to build the residential units that are required to legalize the parking spaces.
- He has not heard of any need to do fire sealing work.  His client discovered the building permit from the public posting.  The first time he heard about this was when he was contacted by staff to submit some information for the litigation.
- It is true that his client and the project sponsor have been through bitter litigation.
- The project sponsor should make negotiations on what space she needs form the DR requestor.  This is not any kind of extortion.  They just want to know what access she needs and what she is willing to do to mitigate any impact this construction project will have on the business operations of the gallery.
(-) Joe O'Donaghue
- The project sponsor is an architect.
- The DR requestor did not know anything about permit search history.
- This project should be denied and need to go back to square one to force this landlord to deal with the project sponsor in a more equitable way.
(-) Larry Roberts – Aid to Supervisor Matt Gonzalez
- They have met with the DR requestor and they feel that he has made negotiations in good faith.
- It is not logical to grant residential parking when there is no residential.
(-) Moulton Elder – DR Requestor
- To provide parking for the condominiums, it took space away from him but there are no condominiums there.
- The issue of having condominiums over his ceiling has not been explained to him. 
- He is worried about the impact construction will have on his gallery.
(+) Charles Olson – Sanger and Olson – Representing Project Sponsor
- He believes that there is no basis for Commission action.
- For many years there has been a landlord/tenant dispute.
- The real issue is how many parking spaces should be approved and if there will be any restrictions to these parking spaces.
- His client had intended to build condominiums.
- His client has spent a lot of money on legal fees related to access to DR requestor's space.
- He requests that seven parking spaces be approved:  four for the two existing residential units, and three for use by Citizen Cake without any time requirement.  Approval of these parking spaces will not be detrimental to the neighborhood; they will serve existing residential and commercial users and not bring new drivers to the neighborhood.
- When MAX limited develops residential units in the future it intends to use all nine spaces for residential purposes.
(+) Pam Pester
-          She has about 20 boxes filled with documents from MAX Limited's previous lawyers documenting the efforts they made over the three years prior to their representation dealing with the DR requestor.
(+) Maria McFerish
- She has a bad relationship with her tenant and this has cost a lot of money and required a lot of changes with the development plans they had for the building.
- Part of the unhappiness of the DR requester was that she negotiated an agreement that the floor space of the DR requestor would be reduced.
- She needs all the parking spaces and would like to develop the third floor as soon as possible into residential dwellings and will need the parking for these dwellings.

Chris Arrott – Member of the Housing and Zoning Committee of the Russian Hill Community Association
RE:  1170-1180 Green Street
-  There is a neighborhood concern regarding the proposed construction project.
- They are concerned about the flawed building permit notification and review process being implemented by the Planning Department for the project on Green Street.
- They are requesting that the proposed new construction project be submitted under a new application for building permit since the project sponsor was using a two year old application that had been dormant for 18 months.
- They are concerned that the information contained in documents is inaccurate.
- They request that the Planning Commission inquire of the Planning Department why the 30 day review process should not be continued and why the Planning Department does not take action to disapprove and cancel the building permit for the proposed new construction.
