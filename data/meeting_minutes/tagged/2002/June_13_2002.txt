          4.          Commission Matters
Commission Secretary:  On June 20, 2002 there will be a joint hearing with the Park and Rec Commission.  This special hearing will begin at 1:30 p.m. and the regular Planning Commission hearing will start at 2:30 p.m.
Commissioner Theoharis: There was a case heard last week regarding 366 Pennsylvania Street.  She has become extremely concerned about units being rented out as a hotel and not being used properly.  She has discovered that not only is there a Pink Pelican but also a Brass Pelican at 26 Teresa Street and that is zoned R-1 and a Green Pelican located at 41 Parsons Street.  These are advertised on the Internet at pelicanrentals.com, which are also advertised in Europe.
If this information is correct, then there are several units, which have been taken off the market.  These units are violating the unit density and the Planning Code.  She would like to know:  1) if these people are paying hotel tax; 2) do they have a business license; 3) are they subject to the City's payroll tax; 4) is San Francisco entitled to a portion of the sales tax; 5) have they paid sales tax to the Franchise Tax Board; and 6) check with the water department to see if they pay a different rate.
She would also like to have the audit available on the website since it is such a large document.  
The Planning Director responded that the audit is available at:  www.sfgov.org/planning.
Copies will also be available at the Planning Department.  Hearings on the audit will be scheduled in the future.
Commissioner Salinas: He would like to know whose jurisdiction is it to follow through on the issue of the pelican rentals.  What laws have been broken?
Commissioner Baltimore:  Review the codes related to the height of penthouses.  In order for open space to be allowed/legal on the roof or upper levels, it has to be accessible to the disabled. Our codes should be consistent with the building codes in terms of the number of feet necessary.  She would like to have staff outline the necessary changes in order to go through the appropriate Commissions for code change.
C.          DIRECTOR'S REPORT
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
          5.          Director's Announcements
1) The Director announced that today he is also the Acting Zoning Administrator while Mr. Badiner is on vacation.
2) He responded to the question Commissioner Salinas asked.  
The property has to be in compliance with the Planning Code as well as the Municipal Code.  The jurisdiction is of the Planning Department when it has to do with use and how a dwelling unit is being used.  The Planning Department will be looking into this.  If there are issues related to the Building Code, this matter will also be referred to the appropriate departments.

                    Preliminary Recommendation: Adopt a motion to endorse the Central Waterfront Cultural Resource Survey (California Department of Parks and Recreation Survey Form DPR 523B-evaluative) and (California Department of Parks and Recreation Survey Form DPR 523A-descriptive and DPR 523B-evaluative) on the following held out properties: 3201 3rd Street, Bayshore Cutoff Tunnels No. 1 and 2, 1155-1161-1163 Tennessee, 580 and 600 Minnesota Street, 2230 Third Street, 815-825 Tennessee Street, 651 Illinois and Piers 68 and 70 Wharves.  
                    Note: On December 13, 2001, following public testimony, the Commission closed the public hearing, the Commission passed a motion to endorse the Central Waterfront Cultural Resource Survey (California Department of Parks and Recreation Survey Form DPR 523A-descriptive) and Context Statement for all resources contained within the Central Waterfront survey boundaries with the exception of 3201 3rd Street, 651 Illinois, 590 Minnesota, 690-698 Minnesota, 2085 Third Street, and 1155-1163 Tennessee, which were held out because of  owner objection to the survey findings.

At the call of the chair, the Planning Commission directed the Planning Department to re-notice all property owners within the Central Waterfront Survey boundaries and to return to the Planning Commission for consideration of endorsement of (California Department of Parks and Recreation Survey Form DPR 523B-evaluative) for all resources within the Central Waterfront survey boundaries.  Per the Chair's instructions, the public hearing for this matter is open.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Tay Via – Coblentz - Patch, Duffy and Bass – Representing the property owner of 600 Minnesota Street
- She would like the Commission to change the designation from 3D to 5S3.
- She does not believe that this should be designated as a district since it is not a district.
(-) Christopher Verplanck – Page and Turnbull
- The designation of 3D is not correct and should be changed to 5S3 since it's more appropriate for 600 Minnesota Street.
(+) Mark Ryser – Board of Directors of San Francisco Beautiful
- This fundamental program is of critical importance and hopes that the Commission will approve this project.
(+) Tim Kelley – President of the Landmark's Board.
- He urges the Commission to bring this survey forward.

(-) Shawn Gorman – The Redlands Group, Inc. and Gee Architects
- The Department will use this survey for permits on the affected properties.
- This survey has circumvented the public process for the designation of historic places and buildings.  It sets a bad precedent for surveys of this nature.

Dan Sullivan – Representing Project Sponsor
- He tried his best to notify as many people as possible regarding the continuance.

Courtney Clarkson
- She is not in agreement with the continuance since she was under the impression that the matter today was about parking only and not about the entire project.
Sylvia Dworkin
- She is not in agreement with the continuance since she doesn't understand why the other side is asking for this continuance.
Re:  Merits of the Case
(-) Carol Molloy
- She lives on California Street.
- The neighborhood is being decimated in regards to parking.
- She does not support this project.

The subject property is a Preference 5 Location (mixed use buildings in high density districts).
                    Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Kelley Pepper – Representing Cingular Wireless
- The purpose of this site is to provide in-building coverage between 3rd and 7th Streets and between Mission and Bryant Streets.
- Users are experiencing dropped calls and call blocking in this area.
- Although this site is a location preference 5, the subject building provides the necessary height since most of the surrounding sites are lower and others are vacant.
-There was a community meeting and no one attended.  She is not aware of any opposition.
(-) Doug Loerenger – Representing SNAFU
- There are 340 thousand cell phone users in San Francisco.  There are still a few people without cell phones.

                    (Continued from Regular Meeting May 23, 2002).
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Ead Nasrah – Appellant
- He read the negative declaration and does not agree with it.  He has been a business owner on Geneva Street for the past twelve years and has seen how bad the traffic problems area.
- People who come to this neighborhood, come to the businesses and leave.  If there is no parking, they will leave and patronize another neighborhood's business.
- People are not going to take public transportation to purchase something at the hardware store.  They will drive to the hardware store, make their purchase and leave.  Not everyone is going to take public transportation.
(-) Dorothy Ann Jones
- She does not agree with the negative declaration because it does not address the parking problems.  She is not against housing.
(-) Carol Rooney
- She has lived in the Excelsior District for 18 years.
- She is not in agreement with constructing housing without parking.
- Something should be built at this location but it should be intelligently done.
(+) David Hooper – New Mission Terrace Improvement Association
- This association does support the development because the economic viability of Mission Street and Geneva Street is very important.
(-) Dexter J. Massoletti – Member of ACORN
- He lives a block away from the Apollo Theatre.
- He is not in agreement with the Negative Declaration because it needs to have a clear study of the traffic problems.
(-) Tom Orzechowski
- The Negative Declaration is not complete and the project is out of scale with the neighborhood.
(+) Lawrence Lee – Project Sponsor
- There are about 2,000 signatures supporting this project.
- There is plenty of parking along the side streets.
- The real concern seems to be about competition with the other businesses.
- He agrees with the recommendation and would like to have the negative declaration upheld.
(+) Steven R. Currier – OMRA
- The Geneva area is one of the most important traffic corridors.
- He believes that the Planning Department has done an exquisite job on this report.
