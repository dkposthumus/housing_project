<<Project Start>>
          
1.          Director's Announcements
          Re:  Emergency Ordinance Legislation
          The Director explained how the emergency ordinance legislation allows Discretionary Review cases to be heard by the Director of Planning and that Conditional Uses are brought forward by request of the applicant.  The applicant, therefore, submits a letter addressed to the Director, waiving their rights to be heard by the Planning Commission.
          Re:  No Hearing of October 31, 2002 and November 7, 2002
          October 31, 2002 is a fifth Thursday and pursuant to Planning Commission Rules and Regulations that hearing is canceled.  To schedule a Special Hearing on this date the Department would need to meet the required time constraints for legal notices and postings.  Unfortunately we cannot do so.  Therefore, the meeting for October 31, 2002 remains canceled.  Also, unless a full Planning Commission is assembled, the hearing scheduled for November 7, 2002 is also canceled.

Re:  965-985 Geneva Street and 852 Paris Street (AKA Apollo Theatre)
(+) Joseph Breall
- The site for this project has been vacant for many years.
- He hopes that this project is not tainted by negativity from the pervious Commission.  This is a very fair and good project.
- The anchor tenant does not agree with the Department's proposal.
(+) Lawrence Lee
- They are prepared to retain one small storefront.
- The anchor tenant will improve the area by providing jobs and aesthetically improving the neighborhood.
- One of the reasons that many small stores have gone out of business is because the vacant location is an eyesore.  Bringing an anchor tenant will allow for a livelier neighborhood.
(+) Michael Yamauchi
- The neighborhood has used a lot of scare tactics to keep away the anchor tenant.
- Many small pharmacies have survived with a Walgreen's near by.
(+) Calvin Yee
- Please approve the project as proposed because if the project is revised, the anchor tenant will withdraw it's application.
(+) Catherine Pacheco
- She has lived in this area her entire life.
- She works in the neighborhood and is a member of the Outer Mission Neighborhood Association.
- There are a lot of storefront vacancies.
- This project is trying to revitalize this area.
(+) Stephen Currier
- The Outer Mission Neighborhood Association has met and voted that it still supports this project.
- He did a neighborhood walk with Supervisor Hall and they noticed that there were two other stores that have closed since the Commission last met.
(+) Robert Grecco
- He was born and raised in this area.
- All around the block there is metered parking with a two-hour maximum.  Parking will not be an issue.
- The loading dock will not be on the Geneva side so that won't be a problem either.
(+) Sheila Pacheco
- She is in favor of the project.
- She has seen the Apollo Theater come up and come down.  She used to take her daughter there when there was something to see do.
- Walgreen's will bring other services to this neighborhood.
(+) Dennis Chu
- He submitted new evidence that pharmacies have coexisted with larger chain pharmacies.
(+) Karen Hemer
- This building really needs to be developed.
- There are many businesses duplicated in the area.
- There are also a lot of empty storefronts.
- Geneva needs one large business for its revitalization.
(-) Mrs. Blanch Simons
- There are no empty storefronts on Geneva.
- Every store is taken.
- Those two storefronts are needed.
(-) Ed Nazrah
- This project has not been able to move forward in a fair way because of the controversy of the previous Commission.
- There are issues here about Proposition M as well.
(-) George Nazrah
- His concern is about the miscommunication about the empty storefronts.
- There are two Walgreen's within a close proximity.
- There is word on the street that the project is a done deal.
- Walgreen's is not even really that interested in this site.  The project sponsors are the ones who would like to have a fancy anchor store for their property.
(-) Dexter Massoletti
- There is a sad political situation here.
- He hopes that this kind of procedural situation does not continue.  There are many people in high positions with too much power.
(-) Dorothy Ann Jones
- She agrees that the neighborhood does not need a Walgreen's.
- There will be a problem with parking.
(-) Marion G. Nasrah
- She has lived in the area for the last 37 years.
- There are a lot of Walgreen's in the area.  There are enough stores already.
- There is no need for a Walgreen's here.
(-) Jiwanah Nazrah
- This project involves an unneeded Walgreen's that would cause many traffic problems.
- There are many Walgreen's close to this area.
(-) Dan Pierini
- The community does not support this project.
- He has done a lot of research.
(+) Tiffany Nguyen
- All the accusations and controversies are not appropriate for this hearing.
- The issue here is if a Walgreen's is appropriate for this neighborhood.
- With this anchor tenant other smaller businesses will benefit.
- There are many businesses that support this project.
E.          CONSIDERATION OF FINDINGS AND FINAL ACTION – UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED, THE PUBLIC HEARING FOR THIS CATEGORY IS CLOSED.

          6.          2002.0452D          (T. TAM: (415) 558-6325)
75 MIRALOMA DRIVE - southeast side, between Juanita Way and Bengal Alley, Lot 34 in Assessor's Block 2973.  Discretionary Review request on Building Permit Application No. 2002.02.23.2627s, proposing to construct a new three-story-over-garage, single-family dwelling on a presently vacant parcel in an RH-1-D (Residential, House, One-Family, Detached) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
          Preliminary Recommendation:  Take Discretionary  Review and approve  the  project with modifications.   
          (Continued from Regular Meeting of  September 12, 2002)
NOTE: On September 26, 2002, following public testimony, the Director of Planning closed the public hearing and continued the matter to October 3, 2002 with instructions to the project sponsor.  They are to express their commitment to carry forward their proposed  recommendations based on yet to be submitted plans; submit the plans; have your engineers assemble all the recommendations in one form--there are [currently] three or four reports with the recommendations spread throughout.  The recommendations should deal with making sure the design is appropriate of the structure and retaining walls; make sure the grading is carried out properly--both during and after construction; explain what steps are going to be taken to protect the topography afterwards.  Submit this to the Department separately and as amendments to the building plan.  Also, submit a complete formal and professional profile that shows the entire condition including the DR requestor's property.  This should be presented to the DR requestor as well as here (at next hearing).  The public hearing may be re-opened to allow testimony on any new information presented.
NOTE: On October 3, 2002 the matter was continued to October 10, 2002.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Margo Bradish – Representing Discretionary Review Requestor
- The applicant has reduced the height of the garage by a few feet.
- She would like to request that Mr. Rollo be allowed to review the revised information submitted.
(+) Christopher Moscone
- The geologist, geotechnical engineer and project sponsor are here for questions.
- They submitted the information requested by the Director.
- Regarding the monitoring protocol: the project sponsor will be monitoring the project.
ACTION:          The Director took Discretionary Review and approved with the following modifications:  1) reduce scale of garage; 2) require an on-site geologist during construction; 3) include items under 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 4 as conditions of approval.
AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMMISSION OR THE DIRECTOR AND ZONING ADMINISTRATOR, THE PUBLIC HEARING FOR  ITEMS 7a & 7b MAY BE REOPENED.
          7a.          2001.1126CV          (D. SIROIS: (415) 558-6313)
965-985 GENEVA AVENUE & 852 PARIS STREET (AKA APOLLO THEATER), north side of Geneva Avenue, between Paris Street and London Street, Lots 5-10 on Assessor's Block 6409  - Request for conditional use authorization to develop a project site greater than 9,999 square feet pursuant to Planning Code Section 712.11; to allow Walgreen's Pharmacy to occupy commercial space on the ground floor and in a new mezzanine in excess of 5,999 square feet pursuant to Section 712.21; and to allow the construction of 8 residential units without the required off-street parking pursuant to Section 161(j). The Project Site is located in an NC-3 (Moderate-Scale Neighborhood Commercial) District and in a 65-X Height and Bulk District, and in an RH-1 (Residential, One-Family) District in a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation:  Approval with conditions for modified version of project.
                    NOTE: On June 13, 2002,  following public testimony, the Commission closed the public hearing and entertained a motion to approve the project.  The motion failed to carry by a  vote of +3 –2.  Commissioners Baltimore and Joe voted no.  Commissioners Chinchilla and Lim were absent.  This matter was continued to June 27, 2002, to allow the absent commissioners to participate in the final action.
NOTE: On June 27, 2002, the Commission entertained the motion to approve with conditions to allow 2 storefronts instead of the proposed 3.  Motion failed to carry by a vote +3 –2.  Commissioner Chinchilla was excused.  Commissioner Fay was absent.   At the call of the Chair the matter was continued to August 1, 2002.
NOTE: On September 12, 2002, this matter was continued indefinitely. It has since been re-noticed and placed on the October 10, 2002 calendar
(Continued from Regular Meeting of September 12, 2002)
ACTION:          Director recommends Approval with the following conditions:
1)          Regarding Conditional Use, allow for the creation of residential housing without the required parking.  These findings can be made under Section 161(j).  The Director recommends to approve that portion of the Conditional Use request.
2)          Regarding the installation of a large retail tenant on the ground floor.  The allowable use is 5,900 sf.  The project sponsor indicated that their proposal before the Department is to allow Walgreen's to consume the entire space except for the space which is currently occupied by the shoe cobbler.  A case has not been made for this type of proposal.  He does not believe that the findings are there specifically with regards to the priority policies under Section 101.1.  There has been a case made, those spaces are valuable and are capable of being occupied by small retail businesses potentially owned by people who live in the immediate neighborhood or at least the immediate neighborhood could provide employment to those small businesses.  The findings from Section 121 have not been made with regard to the need for that space.  The Director recommends that the project sponsor's submittal be denied.  But, the Director would recommend to the appealing body, if this is necessary, would allow a project that would include the space that staff is proposing except that the Director would be willing to consider after an appropriate period of time (a one year period) after the occupancy established by Walgreen's that store No. 3 mentioned in the applicant's attorney's letter dated October 4, 2002, could ultimately be absorbed into the Walgreen's space.  But the design of the space would be controlled by the Planning Department in order to have an interactive frontage and not just the original design which Walgreen's proposed.  Store No. 2 and Store No. 1 could continue to exist.
Final Action:  Director recommends to accept staff's recommendation and approve the conditional use related to Section 161(j) and that the motion expresses that the project sponsor's proposal to eliminate all of the existing store fronts except Store No. 1 to be occupied by a large retail tenant be denied because the Department is not able to make the findings under Section 1.1 and 121 of the Planning Code but under Conditions of Approval, the Director would grant an amended project and the findings should be made to reflect that.  Stores No. 1, 2 and 3 must be created along with Walgreen's.  After a 1 year period that Walgreen's has occupied that space if the project sponsor has not been able to find a sufficient tenant for that space, the space could ultimately become usable by Walgreen's with the design be considered by the Planning Department.  The Conditional Use authorization for lot size over 10,000 sf is approved as well.

- He is not a developer or a carpetbagger as some of his neighbors have called him.
- He is just a family man who would like to expand his house and have all his family living there.
- He is willing to reduce some floor space but cannot reduce the rear part of the extension because it would eliminate a room.
ACTION:          Director recommended to:  1) not take Discretionary Review and approve demolition; 2) Take Discretionary Review on new construction and approve as staff has recommended; revised plans must be submitted to reflect this.  Those plans are also to be provided to the Discretionary Review requestor.
THE FOLLOWING ITEM WAS FROM AN ADDENDUM TO THE REGULAR CALENDAR:
                    2002.0366DD          (B. FU: (415) 558-6613)
879 RHODE ISLAND - east side, between 20th  Street and Southern Heights – Mandatory Discretionary Review, under the Planning Commission’s policy requiring review of housing demolition, of Building Permit Application No. 2001.06.27.2467 proposing to demolish the existing two-story, single-family dwelling and Discretionary Review requested by members of the public of Building Permit Application No. 2001.06.27.2466 proposing to construct a new two-family, four-story over garage building in an RH-3 (Residential, Three-Family) District with a 40-X Height and Bulk Designation.
Preliminary Recommendation: Do no take Discretionary Review and approve Building Permit Applications as proposed.
(Continued from Regular Meeting of September 26, 2002)
SPEAKER(S):
(-) John C. Carney – Discretionary Review Requestor
- He believes that the proposed project is excessively high.
- He would like an entire story removed from the building or remove the staircase that goes to the roof.
(-) Peter Rudolfi
- He lives behind the proposed project.
- There are other people who are opposed to this project but had to leave.
- This house is out of scale.
- The three-foot wall on the roof can be replaced with a metal railing.  This would reduce the scale.
(-) Gary Clausner
- This house is out of scale and should be lowered.
(-) Dick Millet
- He supports the demolition but opposes the new construction because it is out of scale for this neighborhood.
- The units will be luxury--so there will be more cars and less people.
(+) Waren Shmalls
- There are no extraordinary circumstances regarding the height of the building.
- He has communicated with all the immediate neighbors to let them know the details of the project.
ACTION:          Director recommended to:  1)  Do not take Discretionary Review and approve demolition; 2) Take Discretionary Review on new construction and eliminate roof deck, slope roof or allow roof hatch only.

Dick Millet
Re:  Project on Arkansas
- This project is similar to the one previously heard.  He is concerned with the way these projects are being measured.  It does not seem correct since monster homes seem to be being built.
- He would like the Department to work a little bit more diligently on this subject so that not so many cases are brought before the Director or the Planning Commission.
(Did not state name)
Re:  Section 261 
- In an RH-2, an upslope is defined as 20 feet.  For RH-3 it is not defined. 
- This is difficult to know how to handle.  Does RH-2 or does RH-3 apply?
