533 SUTTER STREET - Assessor's Block 296, Lot 13D - Appeal of a Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration.  The project site is currently developed with a two-story-plus-basement building containing a mix of retail, office, and theater uses.  The proposed project would involve the conversion of 4,200 gross square feet (gsf) of existing second-floor offices and theater use to four dwelling units and construction of three additional floors of residential use with four dwelling units on each new floor, for a total of 16 dwelling units.  The existing ground-floor retail would remain as is.  The proposed project would add three stories, approximately 36 feet in height, for a total building height of approximately 65 feet.  The proposed project would add 15,000 gsf of new construction, for a total building floor area of 23,200 gsf.  The project site at 533 Sutter Street (Assessor's Block 0296, Lot 13D) is about 6,050 square feet in size and is located mid-block on the southern side of Sutter Street in the Downtown/Civic Center neighborhood on the block bounded by Mason, Sutter, Powell, and Post Streets.  The entrance and access to the project site would be from Sutter Street.  The existing building has no parking or loading spaces and none are proposed.  The project site is zoned C-3-R (Downtown Retail) District and is within an 80-130-F Height/Bulk District.  The existing building, constructed in 1921, is a Category V (unrated) building within the Kearny-Market-Mason-Sutter Conservation District.

SAN FRANCISCO CRUISE TERMINAL MIXED-USE PROJECT AND BRANNAN STREET WHARF PROJECT - CERTIFICATION OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT (SEIR). The proposed project would involve two components: 1) the construction of two berths (including necessary dredging) and a new terminal for cruise ships that call at the Port of San Francisco, as well as ancillary commercial development, all on Pier 30-32 (Block 9900, Lots 30 and 32); and 2) the construction of a residential project on Seawall Lot 330 (Block 3770, Lots 1 and 2, Block 3771, Lot 1), across the Embarcadero from Pier 30-32. The cruise terminal would contain about 100,000 gross square feet (gsf) of floor area, while the commercial element would include about 370,000 gsf of office space and about 220,000 gsf of retail/entertainment space. About 450 parking spaces would be provided on the pier. The residential component, on the block bounded by the Embarcadero and Beale and Bryant Streets, would include about 350 dwelling units and 350 parking spaces. The SEIR also analyzes a separate but related project involving the design and construction of the Brannan Street Wharf (Block 9900), Lots 34 and 36), a new, approximately 57,000-square-foot waterfront park along the Embarcadero just south of Pier 30-32..  Please Note: The public hearing on the Draft EIR is closed. The public comment period for the Draft EIR ended on January 16, 2002. The Planning Commission does not conduct public review of Final EIRs. However, public comments on the certification may be presented to the Planning Commission.

3003/3005 - 23rd STREET, south side, at the corner of 23rd and Harrison Streets; Lot 1 in Assessor’s Block 3640 – Request for Conditional Use Authorization to construct two dwelling units in the Mission District.  Market-rate dwelling units, that do not provide 25% affordability, are subject to Conditional Use Authorization per the Mission District Interim Controls, Resolution No. 518-01. The property is located in a RH-2 Zoning District and in a 40-X Height and Bulk District.  The proposal is to construct two dwelling units of approximately 2,800 square feet each in the Mission District.  The proposed building height would be 40 feet.
                    Preliminary Recommendation: Approve with conditions.
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Wayne Hu – Real Estate Project Manager and Consultant to the Project Sponsor
- There is a need for more than 20,000 housing units in the City of San Francisco.
- These projects will provide much needed housing units which will be rented.
- He went out to the neighbors and received support from 63 residents.
- They met with the neighbors and there were concerns about the size of the building and what sunlight this project might block.
- In each building there are 4 parking spaces.
- This project is desirable and necessary and has met the requirements for the conditional use.
(-) Jessica Medina
- She and her grandmother live on 23rd and Harrison.
- She is opposed to this project since her family purchased the house because of the view.
- The project will block sunlight from her house and her grandmother has respiratory problems.
- There will be more noise and more problems.
(-) Franz Fuetsch
- He is not against development of this parcel.  He is just against the height of the project and the aesthetics of the project.
- His issues could be addressed by lowering the project.
- There is nothing in this area that is higher than 40 feet.
(-) Amy Fishman
- She lives in the Mission District and works for Mission Housing.
- There hasn't been enough community process for this development.
- Community development needs to be done and not spot-by-spot development.
- Mission Housing has a garden in the area and they were not reached to discuss this project.
(-) Sue Hestor
- This project is very disruptive to this community.
- The live/work style is not in character with the surrounding community.
(+) Alice Barkley – Representing the project sponsor
- The concerned residents who live next door will not have their window blocked.
- This is a residential development that is allowed in this area and it is a vacant lok so there is no displacement.
(+) Joe O'Donaghue – Residential Builders
- 40 to 50 feet in height is not a high-rise.
- The design of this building will be compatible with the other buildings.
(+) Milton Gaines
- He is one of the co-owners of Winfield Design International.  Since 1964 they have been in the same location.  He has been with the company for 33 years.
- They sold their business last year.
- He spoke to about 80 people in the neighborhood and showed the proposed plans.  He received support from most of them.
ACTION:          Approve with the following modifications:  1) sponsor continue to work with the department specifically to try to integrate the design better into the neighborhood; 2) reduce the impact and bulkiness of the building; 3) eliminate the stair tower; 4) assign a notice of special restrictions in order to limit the units to only two; 5) require that the new design come back before the Commission.

(+) Vlad Chernotyz
- He has lived in the neighborhood for 15 years.

(-) Barbara Kiley

                    Preliminary Recommendation:  Take Discretionary Review and Disapprove the Permit

Preliminary Recommendation:  Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the revised building permit application.
 
SPEAKER(S):
Re:  Continuance

- She does not support the continuance.
(-) Marilyn Amini – DR Requestor
- The subject property has a three-story extension in the rear that has never been properly permitted.

- The three-story addition was legalized with permitted work.
- They are trying to make the basement a legal living space.  They are not changing anything.
