SPEAKER(S):
Re:  Continuance
Harry O'Brien
- He realizes that the Commission does not want to entertain a continuance yet he is willing to withdraw the application if necessary but he would prefer to have this case continued.
- The reason why there is a continuance is because there has been a rezoning petition, which will be brought forward to the Board of Supervisors.
- He would like to have one last opportunity to work with the neighborhood before this petition goes before the Board of Supervisors.
Patricia Vaughey
- The neighborhood has lost faith in anything related to the car wash.
- The car wash has violated all the laws.
- This has escalated to the point that they are beyond comprehension.
- They can try to do a continuance for two weeks.

SPEAKER(S):
Re:  Recusal of Commissioner Theoharis
Sue Hestor
- She sent a letter to the Commission, which raised questions regarding a fundraiser that was given by Commissioner Theoharis at her house before the last election which developers; their attorneys and their consultants were invited.  She believes that this is a violation of the law, which has been in affect for a very long time.  Commissioners are different from elected officials.  Commissioners cannot solicit campaign contributions from anyone who has been before them in the preceding three months.  If someone does make a contribution, there is a conflict for a year after the contribution.
- She was aware of this event from reading the newspaper and read the reports online from the Ethics Commission.
- This event was held on September 23, 2002 and Andrew Junius attended this event and made a campaign contribution the previous week of $500.00.
- Mr. Junius wrote a letter stating that the contribution was rescinded.
- She believes that this does not apply in this instance since she believes that Mr. Junius did intend to attend this function.
- If any other Commissioners attended this event and solicited funds, they also have conflicts under the law.
- This is a very serious matter and she would like to have a response from Commissioner Theoharis or her attorney and not from Mr. Junius.
                    RESPONSE:
                    Commissioner Theoharis
-          She has not violated the law and will not recuse herself.
-          
Re:  Merits of the case
(-) Sue Hestor – Representing three of the DR Requestors (Ms. Lynn Hall, Ms. Miller, Mr. Hogan)
- Although the project has been revised, one of the issues from her clients is what is the nature of the landscaping?
- The lot is heavily wooded with lots of vegetation.  These trees are going to come down.
- Her clients will see walls from the rear of their house. 
- She displayed graphics of current vegetation.
- The Commission has not been presented with the revisions.
- The scale of the house is very massive.
- There is nothing in the staff analysis related to the problems when there is a very large development down a grand driveway that has cars coming in the middle of the lot.
- The lot is located behind her clients' houses.  There is a massive amount of space for a driveway.  The driveway is just over scaled.
- The house could be setback 8 feet and would reduce the impact on her client's houses.
- The project sponsor has not addressed the concerns of his neighbors.
- There are issues about soil stability as well as major engineering issues.
- The Commission should require scaling the building back as well as putting serious restrictions on this project like prohibiting the driveway to be used as a roadway for events with large parties and large amounts of cars parked on other people's back wall.
(-) Susan Patton Murray – DR Requestor
- She is here on behalf of her mother.
- They are concerned about the size of the project.
- They are concerned about maintaining the integrity of the hillside and the ramifications of the costs associated with the engineering required to deal with this complex site.
- She read a letter from a civil engineer expressing concerns about the hillside.
(-) Frank M. Van Kurk – DR Requestor
- They have had serious slope problems.
- His mother was forced to have an engineered footing designed to prevent the down slope moving of the home.
- He is concerned that any excavation below the property will cause problems to several of the homes.
- Mr. Akabato's employees have entered his mother's property to remove vegetation and this has not been brought up.
(-) Arnie Lerner
- The perspective views are very misleading.
- The projects will be on the faces of the DR requestors.
- The plans kind of disguise how large this project will really be.
(+) Andrew Junius – Project Sponsor representative
- There are a lot of neighbors who are in support of the project although they have similar impacts.
- The scale issue is an important one here but the size of the lot is quite large.
- The topography hides most of the project from several of the neighbors.
(+) Mr. Stephen Antanaros – Project Architect
- Displayed diagrams of the project.
- Described the architectural aspects of the project.
ACTION:          Took discretionary review and approved the project as revised by project architect:  The revision proposed is to reposition 168 Yerba Buena Avenue.
