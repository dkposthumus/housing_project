2.          Director's Announcements
Re: Cost of Discretionary Reviews
- Responding to the request made by Commissioner William Lee:
- There is a fee of $131.00 for Discretionary Review applications.  However, we spend an estimated average of 25 hours and about $2,500 for each Discretionary Review case we process.  This is just an estimate; he will provide more information at a future budget presentation.
Re:  Fourth and Freelon:
-  The Finance Committee will consider this case tomorrow.  Jean Paul Samaha from staff will provide information on this case to the Commission on Thursday, December 12 2002.
Re:  Fellowship
- There has been word that I (Director Green) have a potential fellowship offer from Harvard.  At this time nothing is decided.  I am the Planning Director now and expect to continue to be the Director in the foreseeable future.  No doubt, the fellowship is an interesting idea and a potential opportunity for me, but it will not be considered until the Spring.
