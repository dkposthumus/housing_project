          1.          2002.0474D          (S. SANCHEZ: 415-558-6679)
                    318 29th AVENUE - east side between California and Clement Streets; Lot 046 in Assessor’s Block 1405 - Staff-initiated request for Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application 2000/10/13/2953 proposing to demolish the existing three level single family dwelling (the project also proposes the new construction of a two-unit building under separate permit).

          3.          Commission Matters
Commissioner Theoharis:  There was an article in the Chronicle regarding the demolition cases being heard today.  The article inferred that the Commission was crowding these types of cases because their (commissioner's) terms might be up by the end of June.  She would like to clarify that the Commission instituted a policy that these cases would have to come before the Commission, even though they didn't have to legally, but because they deserved additional scrutiny.  Because the Commission became aware that there was a backlog of these cases, they scheduled a special hearing on a 5th Thursday (fifth Thursdays are usually canceled) to handle them.

                    Re:  1117 Judah Street
The Commission took Discretionary Review on September 5, 2002 and requested that the project sponsor cut back the 2nd, 3rd and 4th floors by 8 feet.  The Board approved what the project sponsor had proposed to them:  cut back half of the building adjacent to the DR requestor but allowed the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th floor to go back approximately 8 feet. The Board felt that there were special configurations from the DR requestor but that should not grant them a right or an easement over the adjacent property.
Re:  337-339 Mississippi Street
The Commission took Discretionary Review on December 6, 2001 and denied the dwelling merger.  The Board overruled the Commission's decision stating that the market has changed and there are a lot of vacancies and rentals.  This merger would create family housing, which is desperately needed.

          6.                    (L. BADINER: 415-558-6350)
                    Consideration of Adoption of Commission policy on Annual Office Limitation Program – Project Construction
                    (Continued from Regular Meeting of May 23, 2002)
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Jul Niemier
- He is opposed to this policy.  He would like the Commission to not renew or extend this policy.
(-) Mary Bobbitt
- She is opposed to the Bryant Square Project.
(-) Tom Wetzel – Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition
- He is against this policy because during the hearing of the Bryant Square project, the argument of adverse economic impacts could not be used to the benefit of the developers.
- It is shameful to allow this reasoning to go ahead because it shows that the Commission is out for the interest of the developers and not the people of the City.
(-) Sue Hestor
- There has not been enough notice of this item.
- Last week there was a different description on the agenda than this week's agenda.
- This is a major policy that needs to be discussed.
- This item should be continued
(-) Luis Granados – Mission Economic Development Association
- He asks that the Commission not take action on staff's recommendation since the recommendation will be a huge policy decision.
- He believes that projects got permits on a different set of standards.  This policy should apply to projects from here forward and not retroactively.
(-/+) Tay Via – Cobletz, Patch, Duffy and Bass – Representing the Project Sponsor of First and Howard Streets
- If the Commission adopts the new policy in terms of reporting and performance, she requests that they be treated as the other projects.  If not, they will come back for an extension.
(-/+) Tim Tosta – Steefel, Lefitt and Weiss
- His only concern is the message that might be sent from this policy.
- He strongly supports staff recommendation but has a suggestion that would add a further recommendation:  add a provision that would declare that under the economic circumstances like the one we are going through today, that the time be eclipsed from the calculation.
(+) Jim Reuben – Reuben & Alter
- He supports the six to eight projects on the list that his firm has been working on.  He is also in support of the staff recommendation and resolution as drafted.
(-) Calvin Welch – Council of Community Housing Organizations
- He has not seen the recent amendment to the recommendations from the department.
- The thrust of this amendment is to act exactly as in 1991, the question he has is what about the changes in the conditions of the laws of the City?
- If changes of conditions are to be discussed, then the full order of changes and conditions need to be discussed.
- The department needs to let the development community understand that when they come before the Commission a year or two from now, they will be required to meet the new levels of mitigations.  This statement is not made clear.
(-) Robert Herr- 350 Bush Street Project and the Bryant Square Project
- The policy as revised by the Director of Planning and the Zoning Administrator is a sound policy and should be endorsed by the Commission.  The language can always be improved.
(-) Oscar Grande – People Organizing to demand Environmental and Economic Rights (PODER)
- He hopes that the Commission will take no action and continue this matter to another date in order to bring more people from the community to state their comments.
(-) Doug Perry – Editor of Organized Labor
- He is worried about the economy of San Francisco since he is dependent on office building development.
- Given the current state of the economy, it is important not to discourage development because it brings jobs and revenue into the City.
ACTION:          Approved with final language modifications.
AYES:          Baltimore, Chinchilla, Fay, Lim, Salinas, Theoharis
NAYES:          Joe
MOTION:          16418

          7.                    (A. GHOSH:  415-558-6275)
                    CITY PARKING POLICY
                    Discussion of City's Parking Policy as defined in the Charter, General Plan and Planning Code.
SPEAKER(S):
(+/-) Sue Hestor 
- There are a couple of issues related to parking:  1) where there is a reduced parking requirement, it gives a benefit to the developer yet nothing goes to MUNI; 2) there should be increased affordability requested on development projects.
(+/-) Peter Albert – Manager of Planning for San Francisco and Bay Area Rapid Transit system
- Transit oriented development makes sense for the Bay Area and San Francisco.
- It takes housing, which is very much needed, and links it to transit.
- People need a choice as well, and that is not being provided right now.
- General Plan policies make sense for San Francisco in the right location but parking is at the core of the issues.
(+/-) David Snyder – San Francisco Bicycle Coalition and Transportation for a Livable City
- CTLC is a new organization dedicated to connecting land use and transportation and improving transportation for everybody.
- The code needs to be changed to encourage more housing and more affordable housing and change the parking requirements as necessary.  This will be just housing for the rich, and poor people will be thrown out of the City in larger numbers than they are now.
- Alternatives are key.  MUNI is getting a lot better.  The pedestrian advocates are getting stronger.  The new NTA is working on a new bicycle plan.  Now is the time to look at this.
(+) Tom Redoulavich – Member of the BART Board of Directors and a Founding Member of San Francisco Housing Action Coalition
- Staff is headed in the right direction.
- He is happy to encourage the department to do anything that increases ridership on BART.
- The transit system is on the mend in the City.
- The whole transportation picture needs to be looked at.
ACTION:          Meeting Held.  No Action Taken.
D.          PUBLIC COMMENT ON AGENDA ITEMS WHERE THE PUBLIC HEARING HAS BEEN CLOSED
At this time, members of the public who wish to address the Commission on agenda items that have already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing must do so at this time.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.

(+) Nissim Lanvadoa –

(-) Ned Segal

- He was able to save the Elmwood theatre from the wrecking ball.  
- He was able to get low interest loans, funding from local people, find an operator, and convert the theatre form a single screen theatre into a large single screen downstairs and two small screens upstairs.  The theatre is thriving.
(-) Ronald Chun
- He is a life-long resident of San Francisco.
- Saving the theatre will create a nice neighborhood and will preserve the integrity of the neighborhood.
(-) David Monks – Friends of Noe Valley
- He is here to supports his neighbors in the Marina to try to save the theatre.
- His concerns are that there will be more population, more density and these types of locations will be lost.
(-) Tom Radulovich – Member of the BART Board of Directors
- He is here to voice his support for saving the Cinema 21 theatre.
(-) Steve Kahn – Combined Art Form Entertainment
- He represents a San Francisco theatre group who has been looking to lease or buy a 10,000 to 15,000 sq. ft. space to develop a theatre, rehearsal and cafÃ© use.
- It would be a shame to loose this location.
(-) Brian Chaney – Reel Cinema Group
- His group has been looking for space to bring a new concept to San Francisco.
- Single-screen theatres are making it.  They are located in various cities of the United States.
- He would like the Commission to vote on keeping the Cinema 21 a theatre.  He has nothing against Walgreen's, but it should stay where it is.
(-) Bent Hagemark
- He lives near the theatre as well as two Walgreen's.
- When people come to visit him from out of town, he does not take them to Walgreen's, he takes them to the movies.
- He hopes that the Commission will vote against destroying this theatre.
(+) Patricia Vaughey – Marina/Cow Hollow Merchant's Association and Marina/Cow Hollow Neighbors in Action
- She feels that the neighborhood will end up with a vacant building that will be boarded up.
(+) Ray Kaliski
- The theatre business is not viable anymore.
- Opening up a Walgreen's will also open up union construction jobs and union retail jobs when completed.
(+) Jim Reuben – Reuben and Alter
- This theatre has been closed for more than a year.  The issue is not about closing down a vibrant theatre.
(-) Peter Singh – Vice President of Marina Merchants Association
- The Commission has a duty to work towards the neighborhoods.  This means to try to find something better.  There is already a Walgreen's in the neighborhood.
(-) Eric J. Messersmith, Esq.
- He lives in the Marina and is quite familiar with the Cinema 21 theatre.
- He is here to support saving the theatre.
(-) Sal Salma
- He has owned property on Chestnut Street for over 40 years.
- He is a member of the Marina Merchants Association.
- He has been at the theatre many times. But the theatre business is going down.
- Foot traffic is important on Chestnut Street.
(-) Denise LaPoint – San Francisco Neighborhood Theatre Foundation
- The foundation never met with the property owner because they (the property owner) are in an exclusive agreement with Walgreen's.
- She believes that there could be a variety of alternative uses to maintain the space as a theatre.  None can move forward until the exclusive agreement expires or if the Commission does not approve this project.
(-) Davis Bladis
- Walgreen's provides a great deal of sundries items and he is in support of this project.
Re:  355 Country Club Drive
(-) Merriam Levy
- The current owners have made everyone believe that they are only remodeling.
- Occupants in five of the homes in the immediate vicinity have cancer.  The construction will cause traffic and noise.
- She would like the Commission to vote this project down.
(-) Jon Pierucci
- Members of his family have lived on Country Club Drive for over 40 years.
- He is against this project.
(-) Bruce Selby
- He and his wife live across the street from the proposed project.
- This huge addition will destroy one of the most attractive aspects of the neighborhood--the symmetry of the neighborhood.
- It will also encourage other people to come in and building monster homes.
- He is also concerned about the neighbors who have cancer and will be affected by the construction.
(-) Roland Levy
- He lives near this proposed construction.
- This project violates many sections of the Residential Design Guidelines.  For example:  1) neighborhood character; 2) volume and mass; 3) respect for the scale of the neighborhood.
- Only one member of the Commission made a site visit and this same Commission member voted against this project.
- It would be a good idea for the Commissioners to make site visits.
- He hopes that the Commission will vote against this project.
(-) Cris Manitsas – Lakeshore Acres Improvement Club
- He is not an immediate neighbor but the proposed development is out of scale with the neighborhood.
- It is important to make a site visit in order to have a 3 dimensional impression of what will actually happen with this addition.
(+) Steve Vettel – Representing Project Sponsors
- Today is the first he heard that there were people in the neighborhood who are sick.  He is willing to speak to every one of these people to find out what construction conditions would be acceptable to them.
- He described the layout of the construction.
(-) Ronald Chun 
- He is not in support of this project.
- If this project is approved it would become a great monster home.
