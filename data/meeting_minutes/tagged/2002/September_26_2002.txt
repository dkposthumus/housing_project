The recommendations should deal with making sure the design is appropriate for the structure and retaining walls; make sure the grading is carried out properly--both during and after construction; explain what steps are going to be taken to protect the topography afterwards.  Submit this to the Department separately and as amendments to the building plan.  Also, submit a complete, formal and professional profile that shows the entire condition including the DR requestor's property.

(-) Hsu Wilson – Discretionary Review Requestor
- The project sponsor's house has the same amount of exits as the surrounding neighbors.

(-) Elaine Tong
- She is concerned that there is a person living there as a tenant.

- Because of the size of the deck, she did not believe that it would be a problem and started the deck without a permit.  She has now learned about the process and has begun the permit process.
- She would be willing to put up a lattice screen to provide privacy from her neighbor.  She is more than willing to work with her neighbor.

                    Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve Building Permit Application as proposed.
SPEAKER (S):
(-) Rodell Rose – Attorney representing Discretionary Review Requestor

- He met with the board in a couple of instances and made changes to the design of the project.

                    Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and modify design.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Louis Schump – Discretionary Review Requestor
- Privacy is not one of the concerns that he has--it's really about light to the rear yard of the adjacent properties and the consistent character with the neighborhood.
- He read a letter from neighbors who are opposed to the project. 
(-) Michael Caan
- This building would cut away a lot of the light he gets in his home.
- His home will therefore be colder for a longer time of the year. 
- The new modification would allow more sunlight to come into his home.
(+) Peter Rounds – Project Architect
- The design is really in keeping with the general purpose of this block.
- There are a good number of two-family, two-story homes in the neighborhood.
- He has addressed all the concerns the neighbors have had.
ACTION:          Director's recommendation is to take Discretionary Review and 1) not require a front setback; 2) alter the rear addition by eliminating the three foot bay on the third floor so that it's only 17 feet out; 3) reduce height to 8 feet on all the floors (if possible).  If not possible, then reduce the parapet as much as possible.

Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and approve with modifications.
SPEAKER (S):
(-) Bruce Pray – 1st Discretionary Review Requestor
- He has lived in this neighborhood for more than 33 years.
- Almost all the houses have a similar design.  This block has preserved its architectural distinctiveness.
- Many of the residents are opposed to this project.  
- The specifics of the proposed addition would reduce light in their back yard and the fire escape would protrude in the space between the adjacent house.
(-) John Anser – 2nd Discretionary Review Requestor
- The DR requestors are asking the Director to disapprove the third story addition as inconsistent with the character of the neighborhood.
- If the Director approves the project, they would like the project to be modified by reducing the livable square footage to 500 square feet.  This will eliminate the need to include the rear fire escape that has generated too much controversy in the neighborhood.
(+) John Lum – Representing Project Sponsor – John Lum Architecture
- They met with the neighbors several times to try to work out a way to solve issues.
- The neighborhood is very diverse; it is not consistently two stories.
- He realizes that every neighborhood is special yet spot zoning is not allowed.
(+) Raymond Auker – Project Sponsor
- On the block where he lives there are a few three-story homes and some apartment buildings.
- Neighbors have been stating that this addition will set a precedent yet this is false.
- This design keeps within the design guidelines of the neighborhood.
(+) Wyatt Landisman
- He supports this project and agrees that this project does not hurt the character of the block or of the neighborhood in general.
ACTION:          Director's recommendation is to take Discretionary Review and approve the project with modifications:  1) fire escape should be better integrated; 2) provide the separation at the 2nd story; 3) continue to work with staff.

(-) Judith Harding – 2nd Discretionary Review Requestor
- The project is totally out of scale with what was agreed upon 10 years.

Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project as submitted
SPEAKER (S):
(-) Gloria Shih – Discretionary Review Requestor
- Every room in her home is very bright.  She is concerned that the new construction will block this light.
- She would like to have the roof lowered and for a set back near her kitchen and dining area so that not so much light will be blocked.
(-) Brian Shih
- There is not much distance between the two homes.  
- He would recommend revising the drawings and lowering the house a few feet.
(+) Bob Chan – Project Sponsor
- His family is growing and that is the reason why he would like to make this addition to his home.
- The addition will allow for two more bedrooms.  He works at home so one bedroom will become a den.
- He does not intend to rent out any of the rooms.  This addition will not lower the property values of neighboring homes as some people have stated.
- The addition will be similar in style with the existing home.
- This addition also meets the residential design guidelines.
(+) Lisa Wong – Project Architect
- The design of this addition is harmonious with the surrounding homes.
- She is available for questions.
ACTION:          Director recommended that Discretionary Review be taken and the project approved with modifications:  eliminate the internal attic above the existing second floor.  Reduce it by at least two feet or whatever the Building Code requires.

SPEAKERS (S):
(-) Janet Kugler – 1st Discretionary Review Requestor
- She has a small cottage that is blocked by the two adjacent houses.
- The new addition will block even more sunlight to her home.
- She is concerned with the safety of her home since the addition will use up most of her front open space.
- If she gets her sunlight blocked, she will have to use more of her utilities.
(-) Charles Hoffman – 2nd Discretionary Review Requestor
- There will be only a small gap of open space and sunlight if this extension is allowed to go forward.
- He would like a shallower building.  He has a garden and the addition would block the light.
(-) Andrew Eckers
- The existence of this cottage should be respected and it's light and air should be maintained.
(+) Amy Yu – Project Sponsor
- The reason for the extension is because there will be three families living in the building.  One unit will be for her, her husband and ailing parents, and the other will be for an in-law and their families.
(+) Michael Yu
- (Spoke in Chinese.  Interpreted by Amy Yu.)
- He does not own other houses.  This is the house that they want to continue living in so that is why they want to expand.
