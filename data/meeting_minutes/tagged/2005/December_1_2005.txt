south side between Franklin and Gough Streets, Lot 9 (formerly Lots 7 and 8) in Assessor’s Block 854 - 
Request for Conditional Use authorization
 to modify conditions of approval for a previously approved residential project proposed for the subject site but not yet constructed.
 
 That project would remodel an existing building at 49 Page Street demolish an existing building at 53 Page St., and construct an 8-story residential building with 128 dwelling units, ground floor commercial space and 126 parking spaces in a below-grade parking garage. The proposed modifications would change conditions of approval (1) related to the Below Market Rate (BMR) units, to allow them to be sold rather than restricting them to rental tenure only and (2) to "un-bundle" the residential parking spaces (to allow units to be sold without parking spaces).
 
 This project is within an NC-3 District and an 80-A Height and Bulk District.


                       
 Preliminary Recommendation:
 
Approval w/conditions to "un-bundle" parking and Disapproval of ownership tenure for BMR units.

COMMISSIONERS’ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS


 


3.
        
 Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner Antonini:




Would like to comment on a procedural item.
 
 While it has its genesis in a discussion of a particular issue, I think in general terms when we receive legislation or items that we consider from Supervisors or from other sources that have a number of different items, I think it would be well to try to have discussion of all the different bullet points.


Admittedly, when you approve something, you approve the entire item--whether or not the Commission has discussed the bullet points, or different provisions, openly.
 
 But, I think when we are dealing with something that has a lot of very different points, it would probably be a good procedure to try to somehow take commentary or try to discuss all of them.


I think that in some instances, at least in this particular instance, that wasn’t the case.


Although I think this Commission is very good in general about the findings and the fact that the things are vetted very thoroughly, but there have been a couple of instances where I think sometimes things may go through that are the result of perhaps not being completely considered.
 
 I think that it is important that we try to do that wherever possible in the future.




Commissioner Hughes:




 
 About six or eight weeks ago we had an informational hearing on the City’s First Source Hiring Program.
 
 Since that hearing date I happened to catch a Budget and Finance Subcommittee meeting of the Board of Supervisors in which that was an item on the calendar.


Supervisor Mirkarimi had proposed or has proposed an ordinance related to that, which essentially puts enforcement and compliance provisions in there in addition to raising the penalty for noncompliance.


I would like to recognize him for his efforts on that. It’s a very important program.


It’s kind of been sitting there for a long time without a real enforcement mechanism.
 
 So I think I would just like to express my appreciation and thanks for his well thought out ordinance that tightens up compliance with that program.




 


C.
        
 DIRECTOR’S REPORT


 


4.
        
 Director’s Announcements




Board of Supervisors will be holding a Land Use Committee meeting on Wednesday and on the agenda would be the C-3 Residential Parking Legislation.


Also, there was an article in the paper today that I found curious and a bit annoying.


That article says, “Planners don’t want to block freeway views.”
 
 When you read on into the article, it isn’t quite that.
 
 I did send a short note to the Examiner about this.


We’ve asked the sponsors of the project to provide use with various photo montages so we can understand this from the location.


They are proposing to increase the height to 85 feet.


I think this was a well thought out proposal on the Project Sponsor’s part to have a newspaper article that suggests some way or another the Planning staff is presenting some very narrow view there.


We are concerned about commuters’ views from the freeway.
 
 
  
 Quite the contrary.
 
 We look and try to address all implications of a project.
 
 I don’t want you to be misled by this.


This is a project that is under review and we have made no decision whatsoever on what is the appropriate priorities that would say yes or not about an added 5 feet at this location.


Finally, let me also point out two court cases that should be of some interest to you, 1) this was a Housing Element challenge, as you recall.
 
 The City succeeded in that case and the case has been dismissed.


There was a petition of a writ of mandate that was denied.
 
 Which means that the petitioner has the right to appeal it, but they would have to go to the Court of Appeals on that.


I do not think they’ve made that decision yet.
 
 At this level the City was successful in sustaining its point of view.


The City Attorney can mention the Department of Building Inspection case.




Susan Clevelandl-Knowles, Deputy City Attorney’s Office




The second case the Director is referring to is the Superior Court validation of the City’s transfer from the Department of Building Inspection, building permit fees to the Planning Department for long range planning.


The Superior Court validated that transfer and found that because long-range planning is related to the issuance of building permits, that is was appropriate to use building permit fees to fund long-range planning.


Any time the City has to issue a building permit, it needs to find that it is consistent with the zoning and the general plan.

 Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals


BoS
:




On the November 22
nd
 hearing the Board passed the Medical Cannabis Legislation on its second reading.
 
 We expect it to be implemented right around the first of the year.


CEQA appeal of 600 Illinois – The Sponsor and the Appellant in this case did reach an agreement.


680 Illinois – there was a de-facto withdrawal and the Board did uphold the Department’s and your determination that the project was eligible for a negative declaration.


Music City Project – 1353 Bush Street -- a conditional used you reviewed several months ago was appealed to the Board.
 
 There was a great deal of public comment.
 
 The Board upheld your decision unanimously.


Supervisor Daly introduced a draft ordinance not too long ago.
 
 This time it is a formal proposed ordinance.
 
 It will be forwarded to you for your consideration.
 
 It is regarding modifications to the Planning Code with respect to inclusionary housing requirements.


The Supervisors are interested in amending Section 135 of the Code to increase the percentages below market rate units required on a given property from anywhere between 3 and 8%.


Supervisor Daly also introduced a proposed moratorium in the City of all condominium conversions.
 
 This would be in place, should it be adopted, until the City could study the impact of TIC’S.


The third and fourth and last items that I would like to talk about relate to Telegraph hill and the Historic District on Telegraph Hill.
 
 The items are not related.
 
 They are as follows: 1) Supervisor Alioto-Pier introduced an ordinance to expand the boundaries of the Telegraph Hill District; 2) Supervisor Daly would add criteria to the Historic District in order to include alterations and demolitions of three as issues requiring historic review. 
 
 This is of course in response, in part, to some issues that have been raised in the media and elsewhere regarding recent tree demolitions on the Telegraph Hill.

SPEAKERS:


Patricia Vaughey




In 1982 we suggested something similar to this.
 
 I’m glad 26 years later someone thinks it’s the right idea.




Jeremy Paul




Commented on the question raised by President Lee about implementation at the lowest level of our community.
 
 The residential development and residential remodel construction and the way these ideas can permeate further.


Time is all they care about [architects and builders].
 
 Time is more than money.


If they can make decisions driven by following some of the guidelines that the Department of the Environment has put so much effort into – putting it in writing – we are going to see some real results.


If we start to change the way builders think about where their money is going, how they are spending their money to get their project done, we will see the recommendations in this book start to be implemented at all levels of our residential development.




John Bardis




The Mayor has a nice visionary concept that is proposed to you.
 
 I am sort of concerned and I think people should be concerned that in trying to expand, what we’re trying to have as a resource in terms of trees in neighborhoods in the City and greening our City, one would hope there would be some mention in this proposal, that the existing trees – Mr. Hughes referred to the ones on Shasta Street – would somehow be addressed.


That is the resource.
 
 If we allow those to either deteriorate or be removed, we will in effect be canceling whatever efforts this proposal is supposed to be putting together.




Sue Hestor




I find this all very interesting and think of the people behind me as resources to the Planning Department and the Planning Commission.
 
 Because one of the issues you have all the time is sunlight.


It would be very helpful if the Department of the Environment would be helpful to work through the dilemma that you have which is infill buildings and existing neighborhoods that have lot line to lot line coverage.
 
 What is the value of sunlight to the property that is next door?


It doesn’t do anyone any particular good if the building next to you is green certified but it cuts off all the light to your garden and all the light to your windows.


It is not only sunlight in the window; it’s also sunlight in gardens.


These are big issues you deal with every week at the Planning Commission and the Department of the Environment has to think through these issues if they really want to claim the green credential.

Chris Duderstadt




Worked with SPEAK on preparing the land marking.
 
 Sadly your staff didn’t point out that on last Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors approved unanimously the land marking of the Concourse, or at least what will be left of the Concourse after the current project completes.


I must express outrage at the conduct of one of your commissions.
 


You impaneled the Concourse Advisory Commission to serve as a vehicle for the public to communicate with what turns out to be a private group of developers.
 
 As the Concourse Authority itself has move to a bi-monthly meeting scheduled, and they will not meet again until the project will be bought off entirely, I went to the Concourse Advisory Committee.


I sad and listened to they follow no agenda.


I am asking that in the future, in the acceptance of an EIR when you establish advisory committees, that you take a little more interest in how these will impaneled and how they will function.




David (unclear last name)




Spoke in regard to block book notations and enforcement priorities.




Patricia Vaughey




This greening idea is a very good idea and I think it is a wonderful concept.


Every neighborhood really should have a say in what their neighborhood looks like.


We have to have outreach to discuss what is going to work, otherwise we’re going to have a debacle.




No name stated




Spoke in regard to Supervisor Chris Daly’s proposed moratorium on condo conversions.
