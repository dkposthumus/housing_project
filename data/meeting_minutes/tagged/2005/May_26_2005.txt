88 Fifth Street - The Old U.S. Mint
 
- 
Appeal of Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration
 - The proposed project is the rehabilitation plus seismic upgrade and addition to the United States Old Mint located at 88 Fifth Street in downtown San Francisco (Assessor’s Block 3704, Lot 11).
 
 The existing three-story plus an occupied attic 99,921-gross-square-foot (gsf) building would be retained, and the first floor courtyard enclosed in 1973 for offices would be removed,
 
 (a deduction of 4,336 gsf), and additional circulation bridges, stairs and an elevator (addition of 2,642 gsf) would be added within the existing 4-story courtyard.
 
 The existing attic would be expanded on the roof along the south side of the courtyard to create a museum gallery (an addition of 1,554 gsf) with a view of the city skyline to the south.
 
 The courtyard removal and additions of bridges and roof gallery would result in an overall reduction of gsf, for a total floor area of 99,788 gsf.
 
 The building would include 79,957 square feet if usable space total including: 36,326 sf of City History Museum space, 2,082 sf of Museum office space, 2,045 sf of museum back of house space, 2,044 sf of museum retail, and 3,336 sf of museum theater space.
 
 Tenants in the building would be the 8,153 sf Gold Rush and Money Museum, 2,492 sf of small retail lease spaces, and 6,360 gsf of restaurant space and cafe. 3,987 sf would be used for the San Francisco Visitor Center, and the remaining 11,108 sf would be circulation, toilets and support spaces ancillary to the museum use.
 
 The project would include closure of Jessie Street to vehicles, between Mint and Fifth Streets, to be used for outdoor restaurant seating.
 
 The project site is approximately 47,515 sq. ft., is zoned P (Public) within a 90-X height and bulk district, and within the Mid-Market St. Revitalization and Conservation District.
 
 Transaction document approvals would be required from the Board of Supervisors, and a Certificate of Appropriateness would be required by the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board.

 Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner Bradford Bell


Re:
 
  Director’s Search


- She wants to know when there will be an update on the Director’s Search?


 


Commissioner Sue Lee responded:


- This item should be scheduled in the next week or so to update everyone.


 


Commissioner William Lee:


Re:
 
  Van Ness Issue


- He wants a status on this case.


 


Commissioner Olague:


Re: 1234 19
th
 Avenue


- She received several requests from the public to request the Zoning Administrator to rehear this case.


- Some of the concerns are the lack of information to interested parties, that the information heard at the Commission was not heard at the Board of Appeals, etc.


 


Commissioner Antonini:


Re: Procedure


- He requested that Commissioners be informed about high profile projects, like conditional uses, that are in the process of being heard by the Commission.


 


Commissioner Olague:


Re:
 
  Divisadero Formula Retail


- She is concerned that this case will not be heard by the Commission and wants to know how this happened?


 


Zoning Administrator responded:


- Staff has 90 days to review legislation and sometimes there is a lot of “back and forth” going on between staff, the City Attorney and the Board of Supervisors to try and understand it or to try and refine it.


- Because of all this, staff ran close to the 90 days.

Interim Director Macris reported:


Re:
 
  Home Depot


- This project is moving right along.

- There is still some work to be done on the environmental side.


 


Re:
 
  Rincon Hill


- The first major Rincon Hill project will go before the Commission in July based on the notion that the Board of Supervisors will act in July as well.


 


Re:
 
  Trinity Plaza


- Progress is being made on this project also.


- There are negotiations going on at the Board of Supervisors level.


- This project will probably come before the Commission in the Fall.

  Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals


BOS –


Amit Ghosh reported:


Re:
 
  Bicycle Plan


- This was delayed because of an appeal.


- Last week the Land Use Committee unanimously approved the plan.


- The BOS last Tuesday had it’s first reading.


 


Re:
 
  The Visitation Valley


- The Visitation Valley Strategic Concept Plan for the Schlage Lock site and it’s integration into the community.
 
  It was completed a few years ago with the help of the community and other agencies.
 
 There was a delay waiting for private interest in actually developing the site.
 


- Since the site is a toxic site and there are many public improvements to be done, it was felt that the tools of the Redevelopment Agency would be able to bring about the improvements more efficiently and expeditiously.


- At the Land Use Committee they unanimously approved the introduction of a survey area for that plan.
 
  So the concept plan can be implemented.


 


Zoning Administrator reported:


Re:
 
  Massage Establishments


- Supervisor Ma’s legislation was also heard at the Land Use Committee.


 


BOA – None


 


Zoning Administrator responded to Commissioner W. Lee:


Re:
 
  724 Van Ness Avenue


- The BOA upheld his determination that the inclusionary units needed to be rental but that the market rate units did not need to be rental.


- The BOA has a formal rehearing process.


- Mr. Sanger mentioned to him that he was going to request a formal rehearing.


 


Commissioner Bradford Bell:


Re:
 
  Home Depot


- She was under the impression that there was information that Home Depot was not providing to staff even though they had requested it, that the economic study was not provided either which was also requested by staff (apparently staff has gone out and found a firm that will do this) and finally that staff and Home Depot met with the Mayor’s Office and Home Depot still was not sure what they wanted.


 


City Attorney Kate Stacey:


- She recommends that Home Depot be scheduled next week to discuss it further.

UPDATE OF THE DEPARTMENT’S BUDGET


- The mayor is submitting his budget to the Board of Supervisors on Wednesday of next week, so there will be a update next Thursday.


- In February, there will be about 19 positions filled throughout the department.
 
 The majority of those being Planning positions.


- As of today, there has been 11 positions filled, six of which were actually internal promotions, and five coming in from the outside.


- There has been three planner II positions, 7 planner III positions and one accounting position so there this leaves a goal of hiring 17 positions more.


- The department is making reasonable progress and would expect to have at least the vast majority of the process completed towards the end of this summer, early fall.


 


Re:
 
  SF STAT


- This information was given to the Mayor’s office and other agencies in April.


- She will excerpt the information since the complete presentation is about 45 minutes.


- The current workload is similar to last fiscal year.
 
  There is a larger portion of cases compared to permit applications.


- More staff has been placed to process cases.
 


- The case volume has increased about 33 percent.


- There has been an increase in the backlog throught all type of cases.
 
  A backlog is a case that has not been process in the amount of time targeted.


- One of the most significant factors is that at the beginning of the year there were about 1,000 cases in backlog.
 
  The ability to get out of the backlog is impacted.


- Although some of the numbers are overstated (about 15 percent) is related to the tracking system.


- There are efforts to clean up the tracking system in order to get more accurate numbers.


- Regarding timeliness, staff has had a hard time to meet the time requireemnts.


- Brining in more staff will still affect meeting the time requirements of this backlog so meeting the target will still be difficult.


- Timeliness of permit processing is better because there are many cases that are done administratively.

reliminary Recommendation: Approval with Modifications


                       
  (Continued from Regular Meeting of May 12, 2005)


 


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Supervisor Aaron Peskin


- This is not unlike the legislation a few weeks ago on Broadway.


- It is very similar to the reason he initiated that first legislation.


- This is a remnant of historical zoning because of the freeway that had to be torn down a few years ago.


- With this new zoning future developments will be consistent with developments in the area.


- It also brings it to conformance with the Waterfront plan that is being proposed.


(+) Byron Rhett – Planning and Development Director for the Port of San Francisco


- The port is a trustee for the state and manages this land trying to address the mission that was put to the port which is to develop uses for the property that address navigation, fisheries, maritime, natural preservation and public access.


- Hotels is one of the limited uses that this property could be put to that will attract people to the waterfront.


- A developer was searched to develop a hotel at this site.
 
  They chose Stanford Hospitality for this site.


- Hotel would be a feasible use for the site.


- There will be a 255 unit hotel with a garage and open space, garden would be at the end of Davis and Vallejo Streets.


- The Commission has just reviewed the present design of the hotel.


(+) Lawrence Louie – President of Stanford Hospitality


- They have been working on this project for about five to six years.


- The project has been revised many times.


- They have met with several government agencies.
 


- They have heard from the neighbors and have made the appropriate revisions to the project to deal with the issues they mentioned.


- The project will benefit the City and the create jobs.


- He hopes that the Commission will support a 65 foot hotel.


(-) Mark Hornberger – Project Architect


- He also supports 65 feet for this site.


- He displayed diagrams of the buildings in the area as well as images of how the hotel will look like.


- The project is not a high-rise building and will not be out-of-scale.


(-) Teresa Ray – Principal in Planning Strategies for the Port of San Francisco


- This has been going on for more than five years.


- The hotel will be elegant, welcoming and sits comfortable in it’s context.


- Even the condominiums across the street are taller that what this building would be.


- The hotel project came out of the seven year dialogue to get the waterfront plan approved.


- There will also be a lot of streetscape improvements.


(+) Diana Taylor – Waterfront Action Group


- They support the rezoning ordinance without modifications.


- There are only two buildings higher than 40 feet in the area.


- The San Francisco General Plan requires new development to maintain shorter structures near the bay.


- The rezoning of the area would preclude development.


(+) Jonathan Middlebrook


- This whole discussion is being caused by a particular project yet the topic here is rezoning in a historic district.


- Block 139 is the piece of land that directly abuts the Embarcadero.


- This legislation would allow for consistent development in a historic district.


(+) Glen Green


- He lives in the neighborhood.


- What has been done in the past in not a significant reason to continue doing it.


- He urges the Commission to adopt the ordinance without modifications.


(+) Susan Gilbert


- She lives in the neighborhood.


- Broadway is a very attractive boulevard.


- The hotel will be the revitalization of this area.


- Not only should one consider the Embarcadero but also should consider Broadway.


(+) Peter Winklestein – SPUR (Urban Projects Committee)


- SPUR analyzed this project a few month’s ago.


- They looked at a lot of aspects of the project.


- Any lower heights would make developments look “truncated”.


(+) Marvin Kasof


- He is a resident of Telegraph Hill and a member of Renew SF.


- One of his member wrote a memo (which he read) that is in support of the rezoning without modifications.


(+) Ernestine Weiss


- She worked on the waterfront plan.


- A building at the corner of Broadway would destroys the views of the waterfront which is against the waterfront plan.


- It is important to keep with aesthetics.


(+) Joe Butler – Telegraph Hill Dwellers


- For about
, the Telegraph Hill Dwellers has worked to create historic neighborhoods in the area, the waterfront being one of them.


- At the time it was created the embarcadero freeway made its way along and ended at Broadway right at the edge of the historic district.


- They support this legislation as it is written since it will restore the compatibility of a potential buildings on this site with the historic district, and amend the height limits for these three lots so that the original height limit which was set in
 
response to a structure which is no longer there, thankfully, will not mar the historic district in the future.


(+) Frederick Allardyce – Waterfront Action Group


- He lives in the neighborhood.


- For many years the height limit has been 40 feet.


- When Stanford Hospitality won the bid, they know the height limit for the area.


- He supports the motion without modifications.


(+) Paul Wermer – Neighborhood Network


- He supports the proposal unmodified.


- He is concerned about the concept of a 50 foot height district.
 
 This sounds like target zoning.


- He is concerned about what the port has on record.
 


(-) Toby Levine – Chair of the Northeast Waterfront Advisory Committee


- They have been hearing about this project for many years.


- The committee has not been able to come to some consensus about height limits.


- The Stanford project has been under review for about five years.
 
 There has been many revisions done to the project.


- The 40 foot height limit causes problems since it would not be able to achieve the number of rooms that Stanford needs for the project.


- She feels that that Commission should reject the 40 height limit since it will not allow the plans for that corner.


(+) Alice Picuss – Pacific Heights Residents Association


- They support the rezoning to lower height limits to conform with the neighborhood and opposes the create of a 50 foot special zoning district.


- Lower heights create pedestrian friendly environments.


(-) James Fang – Asian Week Newspaper


- Lowering the height limit is not very fair.


- The revenue from this hotel would help San Francisco’s economy.


(+) Giana Miniace


- She lives in the neighborhood.


- Many people have strong ties to the area and they have deserved the right to express their opinions.


- It would not be fair to “change the rules of the game”.


(-) Ezio Rastelli


- He owns property in the area.


- He does not support the legislation since he feels it would not be fair to the hotel.


(+) Erin Grucz – Preservation Advocate for the San Francisco Architectural Heritage


- They support the zoning amendments.


- The current height and bulk limit threaten the small scale of the district.


- She urges the Commission to approve this ordinance.


(+) Jay Folberg – Member of the Waterfront Action Group


- He lives in the area.


- In the historic district there are 40 feet height buildings consistently.


- For six years many people have participated in a study and when the Request for Proposal went out it specifically stated 40 feet height limit.


- The residents would like the proposed hotel to mirror the other buildings in the area.


(+) Jane Winslow


- She submitted some letters for the record.


- The zoning north of the hotel project allows for 65 feet limit.


- There is no requirement for a maximum of 4 stories or 40 feet in the northeast waterfront historic district.


- It is unfair to change the rules.


- She urged the Commission to push for 65 feet height limit.


(+) Arthur Samuelson


- He lives in the area.


- He supports the amendments without modifications.


- Whatever is built, is going to be there for a very long time.


(+) Arthur Chang


- He has been involved in this case for about six years.


- He urged the Commission to uphold the law, mainly the General Plan.


- The Commission has an obligation to uphold the law.


(+) Sue Hestor


- The building has been redesigned because of three people who had good intentions.


- If there is a policy of 40 feet height limit, it should be respected.

Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and approve the project with revisions.


 


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Tamara Foster – Discretionary Review Requestor


- She is concerned about the new construction since it will block the light to her property.


- She is also concerned about the process of this project since she had little time to review the material.


- A reduction of the size is what she asks for.


- She submitted plans with some modifications which would reduce the impact on the surrounding neighbors.


(-) Dennis Davenport


- He is opposed to the granting of the rear yard Variance since it is a bit excessive.


(-) Mat Zwerling


- The neighbors are asking for two Variances, one for parking and one to extend 12 feet beyond code into the backyard.


- The project sponsor does not show proof for any justification for these Variances.


(-) Jefferey Kilik


- Parking is a very bad situation in the area.


- The parking on the streets around the neighborhood are already quite complicated.


- There are many houses that don’t have garages.


- He does not believe that a Variance should be granted for parking.


- There is a very beautiful garden that will not receive sunlight if this project is approved.


(-) Mellisa Peabody


- She submitted a letter from a neighbor who is opposed to the project.


(-) Thomas Harding


- The proposed addition will impact the light and air on their garden.


- He does not support the proposed construction because of these reasons.


- The whole process of Variances has been very difficult for him and his wife.


(+) Mark Buccarelli – Project Architect


- The project is willing to make reductions to the addition.


- The project sponsor was in an automobile accident and needs space for rehabilitation equipment for her lower back.


(+) Boaz Mariles – Project Sponsor


-
 
The garage can technically have three cars.


- He hopes that the Commission will approve the project so that his mother will have enough space to put the rehabilitation equipment she requires.


 


ACTION:
          
  
Take Discretionary Review and make the following modifications:
 
 The proposed addition should be reduced such that no portion of the addition, including roof overhangs, extend into the required rear yard area, except for stairs and landings leading to the ground.
 
 Further, the sizes of the addition should be reduced such that the total usable floor area of the dwelling is not more than 2,250 square feet, resulting in an off-street parking requirement of no more than two spaces, which the garage can accommodate in tandem.
