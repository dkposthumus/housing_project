5800 Third Street Residential and Commercial Mixed-Use Project
 
-
 
Appeal of Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration
 
- The proposed
 
 project would consist of construction of a residential and commercial mixed-use development after demolition of a defunct bottling plant facility at 5800 Third Street (Assessor’s Block 5431A, Lot 001), at the southwest corner of Third Street and Carroll Avenue in the Bayview neighborhood.
 
 The project would include 355 multi-family residential units in four buildings, 13,000 gross square feet (gsf) of ground floor retail space in two of the buildings that would be along Third Street, and 379 off-street parking spaces in the four buildings. The four buildings would total 641,920 gsf in size, ranging in height from 50 to 60 feet tall (four to five stories) and would be built around a central plaza and a private driveway with two visitor loading spaces, with access from Carroll Avenue.
 
 Sixteen surface parking spaces for the retail uses would be provided on the south side of the project site, with access provided from a right-turn-only driveway on Third Street at the southern boundary of the site.
 
 Twenty surface parking spaces for visitors would be provided along the central private driveway.
 
 Currently, the 5.75-acre site is occupied by a three-story, 103,000-gsf closed Coca-Cola bottling plant constructed in 1966, which would be demolished. Current use of the site is temporary parking of moving company trucks and charter buses.
 
 The site is within an M-1 (Light Industrial) District, the Third Street Special Use District (SUD), a 65-J Height and Bulk District, and the proposed Bayview Hunters Point Redevelopment Projects and Zoning Health Center Activity Node.
 
 The project would require Conditional Use Authorization for a Planned Unit Development and for residential uses in an M-1 District by the Planning Commission, which is a public hearing process.

Lewis Epstein


Re:
 
  20 Peters Avenue


- This case was heard previously.


- He asked if there was any opposition and the planner said that there wasn’t any.


- When he came to the hearing, he found out that there was a letter opposing the project.


- He requested a rehearing be scheduled so that he can speak to the issues of the person opposing the project.


 


Debra Bridges


Re:
 
  20 Peters Avenue


- From the hearing on May 12, 2005, no one requested a rehearing;


- It would be equitable to have a rehearing of this matter.


- There were no findings because it was a tie vote[and the status is a result of a non commission action].


 


Kathleen Courtney – Russian hill Community Association


Re:
 
  1122-1126 Green Street


- The Commission rescheduled this case to 6/16/05, but they were never notified that the hearing date had been changed from June 9, 2005 to June 16, 2005.


- She asked that this case be scheduled to June 23, 2005 or a mutual agreed upon date.


 


Jamie Cherry – Russian Hill Community Association


Re:
 
  1122-1126 Green Street


- She also requested that this case be scheduled to June 23, 2005.

John Bardis


Re:
 
  1122-1126 Green Street


- It is important that the process be followed.
 
  There was a change of hearing date and all parties were not notified.


- It would be only fair to pick a mutually agreeable date.


 


Marilyn Amini


Re:
 
  Bicycle Coalition


- She submitted a letter requesting that the Commission call back the CEQA findings regarding the bicycle coalition.


- There are sections in the law that the Commission is obligated to adopt findings before they approve a project.

Commissioner Alexander:


Re:
 
  Bicycle Coalition

Commission Secretary responded:


- This item is not on the calendar.


- The Commission Chair could direct staff to schedule this for reconsideration.


 


Zoning Administrator responded:


- This legislation has gone through the Board of Supervisors already and is no longer within the Commission’s jurisdiction.


 


Commissioner W. Lee


- He feels that Ms. Amini has good arguments.


- He asked the City Attorney to do a written interpretation of Ms. Amini’s arguments.

Request for Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit Application No. 2003.12.21.3024 proposing to legalize a stair penthouse and elevator mechanical equipment constructed without permits at the rear of the roof of the subject building, which houses Shoe Biz, in the Haight Street Neighborhood Commercial District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project.


NOTE:
 This item was originally heard on Thursday, April 21, 2005 when the Commission held a public hearing, took public testimony, closed the public hearing, and passed a motion to take discretionary review and disapprove the permit. Subsequently, a written request that the Discretionary Review case be re-heard by the Commission was accepted on the basis that new information had become available. The Commission President instructed that this item be scheduled for possible reconsideration.
 
 The variance request associated with this permit is not subject to the re-hearing.


 


SPEAKER(S):


(+) David Levy – Morrison and Forrester


- He thanked the Commission for hearing them.


- He requests that the Commission reconsider their determination and pass a motion to deny the request for Discretionary Review.


- Neither of the structures are visible to the project and there are no neighbors opposed to the project.


- His client did not intentionally try to deceive anyone.


(+) Paul Virl


- He wasn’t aware that there was any hazard with the elevator.


- He is opposed to taking Discretionary Review.


(+) Jim Siegel


- The business is an asset to the Haight-Ashbury district.


- His building is filled with graffiti and the owner will not do anything about it, but the owner of the proposed project really tries to reduce graffiti and loitering.


- He feels that the person who is against this project is just being vindictive.


(+) Ali Ghambarian – SOMA Magazine


- He has been publishing this magazine for about 20 years.


- He knows that the owners of the proposed project are the best most respected business owners in the neighborhood.
 
  They contribute a lot [to the community].


- He feels that they would not be people that would do anything illegal.


(+) Michael Musleh


- He owns a business in the area.


- It is very difficult to survive on Haight Street.
 
  It has become very touristy and very expensive to have a business there.


- The project sponsor is one of the oldest businesses in the area.


- The project sponsor has sustained his business and supported the other tenants and business owners of the neighborhood.


(+) Philip Telesco


- He is a business owner in San Francisco.


- He provides hardware and software to small businesses.

- He did not intend to hide or deceive anyone.


- The location of the proposed project is the only seismically feasible location.


(+) Noshin Ansarinia


- She is the wife of the project sponsor.


- One does their best when you are not a developer but there are times when one makes mistakes.


- No one wants to go through what she and her husband are going through.


- She asked the Commission to allow them to install the mechanical room where it is proposed.


(-) Mark Brennan


- This project should not be reheard because there is no new information presented.


- If this project is reheard, it will open a “Pandora’s box.”


- It is outrageous that there have been insinuations that the people opposed to this project are being vindictive.


(-) Matthew Brennan


- State law requests that a mechanical room be placed as close to the elevator as possible.


- He has not known any project that has a mechanical room on the roof.


- The request for a rehearing should be done on the same day according to Robert’s Rules of Order.


(-) Andrew Smith


- He does not support the project.


- The project sponsor intended to put the mechanical room on the roof from the beginning.


- The project sponsor should be held accountable if he made a mistake.


- He should also pay for the abuse of the process.


- There should not be a new hearing on this because there is no new information.


(-) Joe O’Donaghue


- This case should not be reheard.


- There was no new evidence heard today.


- Everyone has to abide by the same laws.


- Although the project sponsor is a very nice person, he violated the laws twice.
