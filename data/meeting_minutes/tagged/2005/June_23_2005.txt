5600 THIRD 
STREET
Residential and Commercial Mixed-Use Project
- revision of Mitigation Measure of Final Mitigated Negative Declaration
 
- The proposed project would include demolition of approximately 110,700 square feet of vacant manufacturing and warehouse buildings and construction of a mixed use retail/commercial/social services development of approximately 277,340 square feet at 5600 Third Street (Assessor's Block 5421, Lots 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11), an approximately 136,750-square-foot (about 3.14 acres ) site, bounded by Bancroft Avenue and Armstrong Avenue, within an M-1 (Light Industrial) District, Third Street Special Use District
 
 (SUD), and a 65-J Height and Bulk District, in the Bayview neighborhood.
 
 The eight-building project would include 260 units: 131 senior affordable housing units, 129 affordable for-sale townhouse units and flats, 165 off-street parking spaces in three ground level garages, and 8,840 gross square feet (gsf) of ground floor retail/commercial/social service space along Third Street and Bancroft Avenue.
 
 The proposed buildings would range in height from three to five stories (up to 52 feet tall).
 
 CEQA Guidelines Section 15074.1 states that a public hearing be held and findings made when a mitigation measure is revised/substituted in a Mitigated Negative Declaration for a project, and a determination be made that the revised/new mitigation measure, in itself, would not cause any potentially significant effect on the environment.
 
 This finding will be made during Commission consideration of the adoption of the proposed Planning Commission Motion of Approval of the proposed revised hazardous materials mitigation measure.
 
 The project would require Conditional Use Authorization from the Planning Commission for a Planned Unit Development and for residential uses in an M-1 District, which is a public hearing process.
 
 The Planned Unit Development would include modifications for residential density, rear yard configuration, no retail/commercial/social service parking and nooff-street loading.


 
 
Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Approve finding of no significant impact with revision of Mitigation Measure 2:
 
 Hazardous Materials of Final Mitigated Negative Declaration.
 


 


 
 
SPEAKERS:


 
 
Steve Atkinson




Negative Declaration is incomplete and inadequate in a couple of respects.


1) On the lack of discussion on the impact of the parking shortfall on near by businesses; 2) the lack of consideration of how a new residential project in an industrial area can affect the continuation of existing industrial operations.

 The Proposal includes demolishing the existing industrial structures on the lots and constructing a mixed-use development that would consist of three phases, and would include about 131
 
 senior housing units, 129 other units, approximately 10,000 square feet of commercial space, and 161 off-street parking spaces.

 SPEAKERS:


 
 
Pamela Simms – Redevelopment Agency




Asked the Commission to amend Condition 9 regarding the affordability because the language currently states that 88% of the units are subordinate.
 
 In fact, in order to obtained the private financing we would need to make these units affordable we will need 100% of the units to be subordinate.




Lydia Tam – Bridge Housing Corporation




Hopes the Commission will vote favorably on this project.




 
 
Kevin Wilcolk, Architect for the project




Gave an overall description of the project.




Kate White




This is a fabulous project.


It will be a beautiful and elegant design.




Marsha Pendergrass




She supports this project 100%, but is concerned that this is for sale housing; concerned with the number of parking spaces and the number of two bedroom units.
 
 If we are trying to keep a family community, the units are too small.
 
 We need three, four or larger [bedroom] units in our community.




Steve Atkinson




Concerned about several negative effects.
 
 First of all I am concerned that this is creating a very large parking shortfall because the project does not provide sufficient parking to meet its demands.




Steve Vettel




34% of the for sale units are 3 bedrooms and 23% are 4 bedrooms.


There is no real parking shortfall associated with this project.




Ernestine Weiss




Approve this project because we need affordable housing, especially in this District.




 


 
 ACTION:
 
 
 
 Approved as amended:
 
 
The project sponsor is
 
required to (1) disclosure to potential tenants of the current industrial nature of the area; (2) minor change in affordability subordination language of condition no. 9; and (3) that they receive appropriate approval by the Planning Commission under PC Sec. 295 to allow new shadow in Bayview Playground.

88 Fifth Street - The Old U.S. Mint
 
- 
Appeal of Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration
 - The proposed project is the rehabilitation plus seismic upgrade and addition to the United States Old Mint located at 88 Fifth Street in downtown San Francisco (Assessor's Block 3704, Lot 11).
 
 The existing three-story plus an occupied attic 99,921-gross-square-foot (gsf) building would be retained, and the first floor courtyard enclosed in 1973 for offices would be removed,
 
 (a deduction of 4,336 gsf), and additional circulation bridges, stairs and an elevator (addition of 2,642 gsf) would be added within the existing 4-story courtyard.
 
 The existing attic would be expanded on the roof along the south side of the courtyard to create a museum gallery (an addition of 1,554 gsf) with a view of the city skyline to the south.
 
 The courtyard removal and additions of bridges and roof gallery would result in an overall reduction of gsf, for a total floor area of 99,788 gsf.
 
 The building would include 79,957 square feet if usable space total including: 36,326 sf of City History Museum space, 2,082 sf of Museum office space, 2,045 sf of museum back of house space, 2,044 sf of museum retail, and 3,336 sf of museum theater space.
 
 Tenants in the building would be the 8,153 sf Gold Rush and Money Museum, 2,492 sf of small retail lease spaces, and 6,360 gsf of restaurant space and cafe. 3,987 sf would be used for the San Francisco Visitor Center, and the remaining 11,108 sf would be circulation, toilets and support spaces ancillary to the museum use.
 
 The project would include closure of Jessie Street to vehicles, between Mint and Fifth Streets, to be used for outdoor restaurant seating.
 
 The project site is approximately 47,515 sq. ft., is zoned P (Public) within a 90-X height and bulk district, and within the Mid-Market St. Revitalization and Conservation District.
 
 Transaction document approvals would be required from the Board of Supervisors, and a Certificate of Appropriateness would be required by the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board.

 This building has been empty for the last 20 months.




This application would bring the building closer into conformance with the prevailing dwelling unit density in the area.


Almost of all of the homes on this block are single-family homes.


This is a historical building, listed in the 1976 architectural survey.




Gregg Scott




It is very disingenuous of the owner to request a unit merger at this late day when all the prior proposals and drawings for this project show that they understood that they have to maintain the number of units.




Alex Pickas




She is not in favor of one unit at 1,600 or 1,800 square feet.


We need families living in Pacific Heights.


We need to maintain the number of units that we started out with.




Margo Park




Opposes the project.

 SPEAKERS:
 


 
 
Nancy Dennis




Asked the Commission to reject the proposed addition and recommend that the applicants build one story on top of their existing structure.


There is no getting around the fact that this story would rise 8 feet above our roof and drastically impact the lower level of our backyard.




Nick Phelps




My concerns about the addition are centered on the effect it would have on our lower patio area.




Unclear name




Spoke against this addition because of the impact it will have on her back yard.


She would lose her quality of life in her house.




Arlene Enos




Opposed to the project.




Anne Clark




Opposes the project.




Elizabeth Tracy




Concerned about the change of character in the neighborhood, reduction of open space, and an increase in population density that would cause impacts such as parking space.




Dorothy Janson




Opposed to the horizontal extension.
 
 If this extension is built her view would be become that of a 3-story blank wall.




Glenn Lou




Asked the Commission to approve the project.




Patricia Booth




We have outgrown our space and we need to provide our sons their own bedrooms




Jeffrey Lou




Asked the Commission to approve the project.




Connie Lou




Respectfully asked the Commission to approve the project.




Sandy Pham




In support of the project.




Carlos Dominguez




Supports the project.




C.J. Higley




This addition is very moderate and the negative impacts expressed by neighbors have been exaggerated.

(Continued from Regular Meeting of June 9, 2005)


 


 
 SPEAKERS:
 


 
 
Richard Marquez, Coalition to Save Mid-Market




Mid-Market is a neighborhood.
 
 It is a place where people live and labor.


Small business owners are concerned that they are going to be forced to move away from the neighborhood.


This area is home for a lot of senior citizens.


Almost everyone in Mid-Market can barely afford $500.00 [a month] in rent.
 
 And everyone pays less than $1,000 in rent.


The community plan calls for a much deeper level of affordability so people who live there can stay there.


We are concerned about pedestrian safety and public traffic in this area.




Sam Deustch, Coalition to Save Mid-Market




It is interesting to see the reinvention of redevelopment.


Quoted Justin Herman quoted --  the land in San Francisco is too valuable for the poor to park on it. 
 
 He was talking about South of Market.


Subsequently, what followed was 30 years of demolitions and evictions that eliminated thousands and thousands of units of affordable housing.


How did we end up in this situation of un-affordability?




Tamara Cooper, San Francisco Beautiful




San Francisco Beautiful supports the provisions within the SUD document that stated that billboards would not be permitted within the Mid-Market area.




Bruce Allison, Living Way Coalition




When Moscone Center was built they actually displaced 2000 people.
 
 That started the homeless problem in the City.


Do you want to start another homeless problem in the City?




Steven Aiello, Green Belt Alliance




Green Belt Alliance definitely supports the Mid-Market Plan.


However, we are concerned about displacement.


It is a very human thing to consider what effects something like this would have on the existing residents.


It is also very important to look at the future potential of plans like this, to bring new residents in, and to continue the vital growth that any city needs.




Valerie O'Donnell, Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation




Asked the Commission to support the Redevelopment Agency plan.




Tracy (unclear last name)




This is a very positive plan for the City.


Urged the Commission to go forward and approve this plan.




Jim Ruben




The Trinity Plaza project is physically within the boundaries of what is intended to be the SUD.


Wanted to make the record clear so that everybody understands this is a very special case.
 
 The newspaper reported accurately that we are in process of negotiating a development agreement.




Kathy Looper




There have been a lot of landmarked buildings demolished in the City.


After those beautiful building were torn-down, for years we've had nothing to replace them.


Here we are again.
 
 We are going to do the same thing and I wonder why?


It has taken 40 years for communities to recover from redevelopment.
 
 All you have to do is look at South of Market, at Fillmore Street and some parts of Van Ness Avenue.


Do we need to do this again to Market Street?


Market Street is on the threshold of revitalizing itself.




Unclear name




Urged the Commission to approve the plan.




Jose Moreno, Housing Action Coalition




The coalition overwhelmingly supports the plan




Jerry Longoria




Asked the Commission not to pass this plan.




Prince Bush




Does not support the plan.




Michael Dugay




Does not support the plan.




 


Bobbie Duke




We are not necessarily opposed to redevelopment as long as we, those in the target area, have a voice in it.
 
 As long as our situations improve.




Susana Bell




If the Mid-Market Plan goes through,
 
 will be forced out of her house, and would also have to pay for her medical coverage




Marie Gomez




If this plan goes through I would have to move out.


She needs her affordable housing.


Do not throw us out from what we call home.




Darrell Cornelius




Redevelopment has never been in the best interest of improving the community.


These people are displaced.
 
 And now you want to take the little they have left and turn them into homeless.




Sammy Shepperd




Does not support this plan.




Unclear name




Does not support the proposed plan.




Lolita Quintanara




We need to keep the nature of South of Market as it is.


Do not displace organizations or people.


Any development must incorporate these features.




Bruce Livingston, Senior Action Network




Would like to see a living space for people to stay in the neighborhood that always lived in the neighborhood--people who are low income.




 
 
Randy Right




Would like to see a Mid-Market that refreshes itself.
 
 One that fluctuates with the people and has livable and affordable rental units.




Lyann Shehan, Bicycle Coalition


-
 
 We need to keep safe and sustainable transportation options throughout this area.
 


 
 
Sharon Brinkley, Pedestrian Safety Advisory Committee




Keep in mind the fact that this is a very busy transit area and we do not need more cars there.




Jason Henderson




Does not support the plan




 
 
Sue Vaughn




Concerned about parking.




Susan King




Strongly requested that the Commission reject this plan.


We do not need another redevelopment area.




Howard Strauss, Sierra Club




Supports the plan.




George Jones




Does not support the plan.




Ken Warner




The goal of this plan is the gentrification of Mid-Market and to build million dollar condos and multi-million dollar condos.


We have struggled to maintain affordable housing in the heart of the City.
 
 We claimed that victory.




Unclear name




Tenants already have enough trouble keeping affordable housing without this plan.




Leonard Brown




The life support system for the main core of people that live in the Tenderloin is much needed.
 
 Doing this redevelopment, people will be displaced who need the services that are located in the Tenderloin.




 


Norma Smith-Willson




We need more affordable housing, SROs and senior housing.


We do not need more cars in the area.




Brian Eck




We have been fighting for years to get our voices heard.
 
 Essentially, we are against redevelopment in the Mid-Market.




Robert Gray




Asked the Commission not to pass this plan.




Charlene Gutter




What is been proposed for the Mid-Market area is high priced housing for computer and other professionals.


What is being left out of the equation are the poor and other creative people who are having difficulty affording this.


Most people who live in this area are here because of rent control and accessible public transportation.




Eva Johnson




To redevelop any part of San Francisco, or any part in the United States, you need to look at the other people--not just the seniors or the rich people--but the people that are in transition.




Terry Fries




Spoke against the redevelopment plan.




Eduardo Gonzalez




We do not need redevelopment that displaces poor people.




Effrain Rodriguez


-
 
 Is against the redevelopment plan


Bill Murphy




I am too poor to be able to afford another place to live.


Does redevelopment include poor people?




Stafford Parker




We cannot afford the proposed expensive condos.
 
 We need affordable housing.




John Elberling




This project is going to drive a lot people out of their home.




Philip Milton




We need more affordable housing.
 
 We need to build a better neighborhood that would include us, the poor people.




 
 
Randi Wrytt




Our Mid-Market redevelopment needs to be something more than buildings.
 
 It needs to be a place that refreshes itself.
 
 One that can fluctuate within the years and be part of the people of San Francisco.




Louis Ligouri




Is in favor of the Mid-Market project.


The area is in need of renovation.
 
 It is an infected area.




Brett Gladstone




Asked the Commission to approve the plan.




Samuel Noily




Spoke against the redevelopment plan.




 
 
Calvin Welch




Spoke in support of the redevelopment plan.




Larry Petit




Opposes the redevelopment plan.




Lisa Garcia-Gray




This plan is not speaking to the real residents of Mid-Market.
 


The poor residents of Mid-Market do not have power and million dollar contract behind them.




 


 


Booh Eduardo




Respectfully requested that the Commission hold the Redevelopment Agency accountable for their actions.




Elizabeth Alexander




Spoke against the redevelopment plan.




Gen Fujioka




Urged the Commission to reject the proposed plan.


The proposed plan failed to address the potential or likely discriminatory impact on the poor people of this neighborhood




Robert Lazzara




Urged the Commission to consider parking in order to keep the miracle of the theaters in the area alive.




Keith Savage




Urged the Commission to consider that all the people who will be displaced will be out on the street without training.
 
 Provide or create training for them.




Greg Holland




Supports the plan.




Tom Hart




The Mid-Market plan will give the area the ability to try to make some changes that bring about good in the area.




Scott Houghton




Concerned about the short-term parking.


Parking is adequate right now but can be inadequate on the nights when all theaters are open.




C. J. Higley




There has been a lot of misinformation about this project.


In addition to the affordable housing dollars that the plan would generate, the tax increment financing will also create placement improvements that will make Mid-Market an honest to goodness residential mix-use neighborhood.
 
 Improvements like trees, street furniture, pedestrian improvements and transportation options.




Sharon Slater




Supports the plan.




Chris Peterson




Supports the concept that this plan is encouraging--high density development in the Mid-Market as long as there is adequate protection provided for those who already live there.




Pam Hagen




Is in support of the plan.




Linda Coeso




Urged the Commission to pass the plan so we can start seeing the positive impacts of it soon.




Elizabeth Vanclute




Spoke in support of the plan.




David Yee




Parking availability is necessary for those who live and work in the Mid-Market area.
 
 Especially for the theater patrons.




David Hart




Support the plan.




Karl Olson, Attorney for the Hearst Corporation




The Hearst Corporation objects on behalf of its property at 901 Mission Street within the District.


We are concerned about the SUD as currently configured because it could interfere with the development and renovation rights of property owners.


The Hearst Corporation also believes that its property at 901 Mission St. has little in common with the rest of the proposed SUD, specifically some of the blocks of Market Street between 6
th
 and 9
th
, and the Tenderloin blocks north of Market St. in the SUD.


The apparent emphasis on housing in the area also may conflict with the development and use of the Chronicle commercial property in the area.


The Hearst Corporation does not want to be forced to develop its property for housing or for any particular use
.




Kate White, Housing Action Coalition




One of the only ways to secure permanently affordable low income housing is to create a redevelopment area.


The history of redevelopment is tragic and abominable.


To those who oppose this plan, I would like to know what is their solution for creating affordable housing, for allowing poor people to stay in Mid-Market, what is their solution?




Jeffrey E. Auman




Spoke against the redevelopment plan.




Gary Huck




The Redevelopment Agency is a shame and a cancer on the City of San Francisco and should be abolished.

This is a very beautiful City but it is hard to move here and harder to stay here.

April Veneracion

Steve Vettel




This plan is very well balanced and the combination of the redevelopment plan and the SUD rezoning will do what it is intended to do.




Alice Barkley




Against the Redevelopment Agency managing the project.




Jim Salinas

 In support of plan.


Casey Mills




Do not pass this redevelopment plan.
