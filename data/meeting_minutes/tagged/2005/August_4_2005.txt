Re: Moratorium in the Mission District

 This has already been contemplated.
 
 Several meetings have been scheduled.


     
 
   
 
Commissioner W. Lee




    
 Requested a report on the First Source Hiring process with Home Depot regarding Supervisor Sophie Maxwell’s ordinance.




Larry Badiner – Zoning Administrator responded:




Supervisor Maxwell asked about implementation of the amendments to the First Source Hearing Program and not specifically about Home Depot.


There has been a report prepared.
 
 We will keep the Commission informed.




    
 Commissioner Hughes




Had a question for Deputy City Attorney Kate Stacey.
 
 It is a process question that has been raised regarding sections 304 and the timing of the 90 days period.


How is ‘received by the Commission’ interpreted? Does it means:
 
 Received by the Commission Secretary, Received by the seated Commission during a calendared meeting, or whatever?
 
 What is the definition of or the interpretation of that language by your office?




Kathe Stacey – Deputy City Attorney responded:




Normally it is the Zoning Administrator who makes interpretation of the Planning Code.




    
 
 
 
Commisioner Hughes:




If that is the case then the Zoning Administrator is the one who makes that call.
 
 Could you please give us a clarification about that language?




 
 
         
 
Larry Badiner – Zoning Administrator responded:




His recollection is 90 days from the Department’s receipt.




                
 
Commissioner S. Lee




How timely are we in responding to legislation initiated by the Board of Supervisors?


We get a copy of the legislation in our correspondence but we don’t actually get an analysis or review by staff until much later,


Is there a more efficient way of providing us an analysis?

Planning Code Section 260 Amendments
 
- 
Consideration of an Ordinance amending San Francisco Planning Code by amending section 260 to increase the height exemption for elevator penthouses from 10 to 16 feet
, to allow the Zoning Administrator to grant further exemptions for buildings with height limits of more than 65 feet where such an exemption is required to meet state or federal laws or regulations; and making findings of consistency with the priority policies of Planning Code Section 101.1 and the General Plan.


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Approval with Modifications


                       
 
(Continued from Regular Meeting of July 28,
 
 2005)


NOTE
: On June 16, 2005, following public testimony, the Commission closed the public hearing, and continued the matter to June 23, 2005 by vote +6 –0.
 
 Commissioner William Lee was absent.
 
 Public hearing remains open for any new information.


                       


                       
 
SPEAKERS:


                       
 Zack Stewart




Urged the Commission to keep the limit at 40 feet.




           
 
Nann Roth




Does not oppose providing handicap roof top access, when rooftop access is required.




     
 
Stan Teng




 
 Does not think this is an issue about height limits versus accessibility.
 
 We all want
   
 accessibility and should comply with the code.




           
 
Edward Evans


                       
 No name stated




In support for the legislation




                       
 Bob Planthold




.




                       
 
Leslie Blake


                       
 -
 
Asked the Commission to pass the legislation.


Judith
 
 
Duffy




.




  
 Joan Woods




Requested that the height limits be left in place and not give in to pressure by the developers
.




Gerry Crowley




We should be looking to perhaps reduce the height of the building to below 40 feet.


 
 Perhaps we should explore other means of providing disability access at levels below the roof.




Brad Willmore




.


 
 
Right now rooftop exceptions in the code are out of control, we have exceptions for mechanical, skylights, windbreaks, all kind of things.


The most preferred location for open space should be immediately adjacent to the unit or on the ground floor.


Allowing this legislation only ensure that he most preferred location will be routinely ignore by developers.


 
 Save San Francisco for one more opportunity for bad design.




Peter Winkelstein


-
 
 
I cannot believe any developer will build a 16-foot elevator shaft when he can build a 10-foot elevator shaft.




The concerns are misplaced because it simple won’t happen in the 40-foot height districts of the City.




Gary Yacko, Elevator Engineeer




Responded to some technical questions regarding this legislation.




Ellen Chan


-
 
 The size of the elevator is related to the size and the building itself.




If we talk about a bigger building then you can put some in setback requirements for the 16-foot elevator shaft.
 
 That would eliminate a lot of our concerns.




Gary Gee




Supports the legislation.




Joe Cassidy




Supports legislation




Alice Barkeley


- This legislation addresses the kind of open space requirement that meets the needs of everyone.




Urged the Commission to pass this legislation.




Sue Hestor


-
 
 If this legislation passes, you should say that the elevator should pull back from the back to reduce the profile against the people that live on the other side that have light-well.


Joe O’Donoghue


- Supports the legislation.


Marilyn Amini




We need open space in San Francisco, rather than building up to the max, which is what the developers are looking for.




 


                       
 ACTION:
          
 Approved as amended:


 




The proposed amendments to Planning Code Section 260(b)(1)(B) be amended such that a new sentence is added at the end of the Section which would read “The placement and/or architectural treatment of any elevator penthouse in a residential district which would be exempted from height limits under this Section shall be reviewed for compliance with the Residential Design Guidelines and any other related policies or design guidelines adopted by the Planning Commission.”


Neighborhood Notification.
 
The proposed amendments to Planning Code Section 260(b)(1)(B) be amended such that a new sentence is added at the end of the Section, immediately following the sentence in Number 1, above,
 
 which would read “In districts where the height limit is 65 feet or less and in areas where neighborhood notification is required under Planning Code Sections 311 or 312, proposed elevator penthouses which exceed the applicable height limit by more than 10 feet shall be subject to the notification requirements of Section 311 or 312, as appropriate.”


Penthouse Footprint Moderation.
 
The proposed amendments to Planning Code Section 260(b)(1)(B) be amended such that immediately following the sentence which reads “However, for elevator penthouses, the exemption shall be limited to the top 16 feet regardless of the height limit of the building,” a new passage should be added which would read “and shall be limited to the footprint of the elevator shaft.” This amendment was offered by the office of Supervisor Alioto-Pier in the interest of minimizing any potential adverse affect of an elevator penthouse on neighboring properties.

PLANNING COMMISSION RULES AND REGULATIONS
 
- 
Consideration of amendment
 to Article IV, Sections 3 & 6 to address notice and voting; add a new Section 7 to address jurisdiction; and renumber remaining sections of Article IV.


                                               
  (Continued from Regular Meeting of July 14, 2005)


 


     
 SPEAKERS.


     
 
Robert Pender




Wondering why now before the election in November that these changes are been made and there has not been discussion about it.




           
 ACTION:
          
 Approved as modified:




Article IV, 
Section 3 Notice
, the last sentence shall read: …No matter shall be considered at any Special Meeting unless included in the Notice calling such meeting.


Article IV, 
Section 6 Voting
 and 
Section 7 Jurisdiction
 were amended to read as follows:




Section 6.
        
 
Voting
.
 


 


a.
        
 
Procedural Matters.
 
 Pursuant to Charter Section 4.104, with respect to matters of procedure the Commission may act by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members present, so long as the members present constitute a quorum
.


 


b.
        
 Except as provided in “a” above, every Official Act taken by the Commission, including, but not limited to, those based on its jurisdiction derived from the Planning Code, Chapter 31 of the Administrative Code, the Subdivision Code and Discretionary Review Powers of the Commission, may be by “Motion” or Resolution adopted by a majority vote of all members of the Commission (four (4) votes).
 
 All members present shall vote for or against each question brought to a vote unless a member is excused from voting by a conflict of interest or a motion adopted by a majority of the members present.


 


A motion that receives less than four votes is a failed motion resulting in disapproval of the action requested to be taken by the Commission unless a substitute motion for a continuance or other action is adopted.
 
 (For example:
 
 a request for Conditional Use requires four votes to approve; failure to receive the four votes results in denial of the conditional use.
 
 A request for Discretionary Review requires four votes to take discretionary review and modify the project; failure to receive the four votes results in approval of the proposed project without modification.)


 


A motion of intent occurs when the Commission passes a motion by a majority of all members of the Commission that is contrary to the preliminary recommendation of the Planning Department staff and does not have findings that support the intended action.
 
 Any Commissioner absent from participation in the action of intent must be provided all relevant case material and hearing tapes for review prior to a scheduled hearing for consideration of the final motion.


 


c.
        
 Once the Commission holds the public hearing on a permit application, receives all public testimony and declares that it is ready to consider approval or disapproval of the application, the applicant shall not be permitted to withdraw the application, except with the consent of the Commission.
 
 In the event that the Commission passes any motion of intent to approve or disapprove a permit application before them, the applicant shall not be permitted to withdraw the application prior to the Commission’s completion of their action with passage of a written “Motion” with findings or a resolution.


 


d.
        
 Once the Commission holds a public hearing on a matter before them, enters into deliberation and a motion for action is made and receives a second prior to the end of discussion, a request for “call the question” by any member other than the President or Chair would be addressed as follows:
 
 The request for “call the question” is considered a motion to halt discussion and must have a second to proceed.
 
 If the motion does not receive a second, the motion dies and discussion resumes on the matter on the floor prior to the motion to “call the question.”
 
 If the motion receives a second then a vote must be taken immediately and passed by a majority of those present.


 


Section 7.
        
 
Jurisdiction.
  
 Pursuant to Charter Section 4.105, the Commission has the jurisdiction to approve prior to issuance “[all] permits and licenses dependent on, or affected by, the Planning Code administered by the Planning Department.”
 
 Acting under this section, the Commission may at its discretion by a majority vote of the Commission (four votes), request staff to bring before it for review any such permit or license that has not yet been issued even if the application has been approved by the Commission or Department staff and forwarded to the Central Permit Bureau.
 
 The Commission loses jurisdiction upon either the City’s issuance of the permit or license, or a valid appeal has been filed to an appellant body.


                       
 AYES:
             
 Alexander, S. Lee, Hughes, Olague


ABSENT:
         
 Antonini, Bradford-Bell, W. Lee

BETTER NEIGHBORHOODS PLUS TEXT AMENDMENTS
 
-
 
Consideration of an Ordinance [Board of Supervisors File Number 050601] which would establish a “Better Neighborhoods Planning and Implementation Process”
 by (a) adding Chapter 36 to the Administrative Code in order to set forth uniform procedures for developing comprehensive neighborhood plans, (b) amending Administrative Code Section 3.4 to provide for integrated budget documents, and (c) adding Section 312A to the Planning Code regarding discretionary review for projects located within plan areas.


Preliminary Recommendation: Commission Holds Public Hearing


(Continued from Regular Meeting of July 28, 2005)


this is for discussion only.
 
 no action at this hearing.


 


SPEAKERS:
     


  
 
  
 
Marilyn Amini




Requested a clarification on the 90 days extension




Sue Hestor




Currently there is not an established citywide effort or process for long term planning.


There was/is not community participation.


Our intention was to make some generic workable and fair process for creating land use planning legislation for San Francisco.




Unclear name




Needs to make public participation a priority.




Unclear name




It seems to her that the Better Neighborhood Plan increases density through rezoning neighborhoods.
 
 As such, this could hardly be thought as better by current residents or already fully developed neighborhoods


One of the most disturbing elements in the ordinance is the arbitrary limitation based in discretionary review.




 


Robert Pender




We have not had enough public participation. We have not had any participation or any kind of discussion on what should happen in the southwest corner of San Francisco.




Mary Ann Miller




Her main observation is that there really appears to be no need for special legislation.
 
 Why are we preempting parts of the code and putting them aside?


What is the difference between Better Neighborhood process and the Redevelopment Agency process?




           
 
Judy Berkowitz




We would like to have more time to study this legislation and the amendments that have come in lately so we can be able to make comments on exact places in the legislation that we think needs to be looked at.




           
 
Charles


-
 
 We need to look into the fiscal implications.
