INFORMATIONAL PRESENTATION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ON THE EASTERN NEIGHBORHOODS HEALTH IMPACT ASSESSMENT
 - The Public Health Department is engaged in a Health Impact Assessment of the Eastern Neighborhoods Rezoning options separately from the Planning Department's Environmental Impact Report. This presentation by the Health Department will be an informational presentation to the Planning Commission on the process being followed to conduct this assessment and how this process will inform the Commission on the health impacts associated with the Eastern Neighborhoods rezoning.


Action: Informational Only


Rajiv Bhatia - Department of Health


- He gave a PowerPoint presentation regarding an assessment that the Department of Public Health is conducting in the Eastern Neighborhoods.


- What is public health?  Trying to allow the societal conditions that allow people to be healthy.  This involves working in partnership with a lot of organizations.


- What makes people healthy?  A lot of money can be spent on health services and not result in very healthy people.  Part of the answer is to work on social conditions.


- Research has shown that in segregated neighborhoods there is poorer air quality, nutrition, crime and violence, hospitalizations, environmental health problems, etc.


- There is a lack of environmental "assets" like grocery stores, financial institutions, jobs, etc.


- They were asked to address the issue of asthma, for example.  After a study being done, they discovered that many households had mold, windows not working properly, bad ventilation, etc.


- Lead is another situation that can result in asthma.


- Cars are another cause of environmental problems.  People who live in areas with high density, freeways, roads, etc. have high levels of pollution that also causes a lot of health problems.


- As houses are being built near traffic, it is a hard decision to make-balancing the need for housing with existing traffic concerns.  There is also the issue of pedestrians being safe near high traffic areas.


- Health Impact Assessment is a fancy term for saying, "how does a public policy affect health?"  HIA looks at all of the connections between a public policy and a variety of health outcomes at the same time.


- Many countries are involved in this health assessment (Canada, New England, New Zeeland, etc.)


- A collaborative consensus building process is a way of getting the Health Department to work in a proactive way in land planning and land use.  There are many City departments that can work together to make this happen.


- The process involves the following:  vision for a healthy city, identification of community health objectives and research questions, research on community conditions and improvement strategies, recommendations for development policy and selection of indicators of progress.


- There will be recommendations made to the City agencies that will be involved in this assessment.


- In the summer, they will be looking at the recommendations for their zoning plans and review how they align with the plans of the Planning Department.


Joe Speaks - MTA


- He is very impressed with how this process is bringing a variety of different people together.


- Regarding their feel management, they are currently working on better environmental friendly sources.


- Although, this is early in the process, it is important to start now.


Robert Pender - San Francisco Tenant's Network


- They surveyed their members recently and all the members support low-income units in the Eastern Neighborhoods.


Debra Stein - GCS Strategies


- She is representing a variety of stakeholders.


- She is concerned that there has not been enough outreach to community groups and activists, the real estate community, etc.


- She made several requests to be notified of when meetings were being held, when documents were issued, etc.  She did not receive this information.


- It would be better to wait for the DEIR certification.  Then feedback can come back for adoption.


Eric Quezada - Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition


- This, for the City, is a breakthrough in terms of how development is viewed.


- When there are families that have to live in SRO rooms - this is a health impact.


- [Usually] there seems to be some entitled approach on who could attend discussions.  He feels that this is a very open forum.


- They want to continue to participate in this process.


Bob Hernandez


- He has lived in the Mission all his life.


- He has had asthma all his life.


- It is important to incorporate all the health needs of the neighborhoods.


- There are about 40 organizations that have been invited to be part of the process.


- If more people knew how important this process was, there would be more people here to comment.
