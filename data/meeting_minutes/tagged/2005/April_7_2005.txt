88 FIFTH STREET - THE OLD U.S. MINT
 - 
Appeal of Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration
 - The proposed project is the rehabilitation plus seismic upgrade and addition to the United States Old Mint located at 88 Fifth Street in downtown San Francisco (Assessor's Block 3704, Lot 11).  The existing three-story plus an occupied attic 99,921-gross-square-foot (gsf) building would be retained, and the first floor courtyard enclosed in 1973 for offices would be removed,  (a deduction of 4,336 gsf), and additional circulation bridges, stairs and an elevator (addition of 2,642 gsf) would be added within the existing 4-story courtyard.  The existing attic would be expanded on the roof along the south side of the courtyard to create a museum gallery (an addition of 1,554 gsf) with a view of the city skyline to the south.  The courtyard removal and additions of bridges and roof gallery would result in an overall reduction of gsf, for a total floor area of 99,788 gsf.  The building would include 79,957 square feet if usable space total including: 36,326 sf of City History Museum space, 2,082 sf of Museum office space, 2,045 sf of museum back of house space, 2,044 sf of museum retail, and 3,336 sf of museum theater space.  Tenants in the building would be the 8,153 sf Gold Rush and Money Museum, 2,492 sf of small retail lease spaces, and 6,360 gsf of restaurant space and cafe. 3,987 sf would be used for the San Francisco Visitor Center, and the remaining 11,108 sf would be circulation, toilets and support spaces ancillary to the museum use.  The project would include closure of Jessie Street to vehicles, between Mint and Fifth Streets, to be used for outdoor restaurant seating.  The project site is approximately 47,515 sq. ft., is zoned P (Public) within a 90-X height and bulk district, and within the Mid-Market St. Revitalization and Conservation District.  Transaction document approvals would be required from the Board of Supervisors, and the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board would require a Certificate of Appropriateness.

Appeal of Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration.  
The proposed project involves the construction of an approximately 45,238-gross-square-foot (gsf), eight-story, 80-foot-high residential building, which would include about 31,868 gsf of residential use (29 dwelling units), and 13,370 gsf of parking (35 off-street parking spaces).  The proposed project would also include the demolition of an existing 7,500 gsf, one-story-plus-mezzanine building formerly occupied by Teevan Restoration.  The approximately 7,021-square-foot (sf) project site is located mid-block on the north side of Washington Street between Van Ness Avenue and Franklin Street.  The site is zoned RC-4 (Residential-Commercial Combined District, High Density) and is in the Van Ness Special Use District, and an 80-D height and bulk district.  The proposed project would require conditional use authorization for new construction exceeding 40 feet in height in the Van Ness Special Use District, and a variance for one unit, which would not meet the dwelling unit exposure requirement.

7. Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner Antonini:


Re:  Planning Director


- They have received a lot of resumes and are conducting a lot of interviews for the position of Director.


Commissioner W. Lee:


Re:  55 Natoma


- He received a call on this project that was demolished.


- Does this project have state jurisdiction or local jurisdiction?


- There is construction going on but the public believes that the project should have gone through local departments.


Zoning Administrator Responded:


Staff will look into this.


Commissioner Hughes:


Re:  Board of Realtors


- He would like to know if there is consensus of the Commission to think about whether or not the Commission should direct staff to communicate in written form to the Board of Realtors our request that they notify buyers of properties--where applicable-if they fall under the requirements of the exclusionary threshold. 


- A couple of weeks ago, he had indicated that he would like his fellow commissioners to think about this since properties that fall within the threshold of the demolition policy since  they should disclose this information to potential buyers so that people who do purchase properties that are subject to the demolition policy go in with their eyes open.


Commissioner Sue Lee:


Re:  Board of Realtors


- She recommended that staff and Commissioners meet with the representatives of the Board of Realtors to discuss this.


NOTE:  Commissioner Antonini, Olague, Hughes are in agreement with Commissioner Sue Lee.


Commissioner Olague:


Re:  Health Assessment


- Will this be scheduled in the future?


Interim Director responded


- This will be scheduled on April 21, 2005.


Commission Secretary responded:


- She recommends a noon workshop.


Commissioner Olague:


Re:  Bloomingdale's


- She would like a briefing on this project.


Interim Director responded:


- Staff can organize a representative to come and give a status report.


Commissioner Olague:


- On Tuesday, at the Board of Supervisors, Supervisor McGoldrick introduced legislation on Better Neighborhoods.


Interim Director responded:


- This was just introduced on Tuesday so staff will look into this.


Commissioner W. Lee:


Re:  Transbay Terminal


- He would like a briefing from the City Attorney on the Transbay Terminal.


- Was there any exposure on this?


City Attorney Kate Stacey Responded:


- Because they don't have a written decision from the judge yet, they are not certain of the exact terms of the decision. 


- Based on the comments and questioning that went on in court on Tuesday, the attorney had four concerns about the EIR.


- One was the description of the environmental setting since it didn't include the Natoma project. 


- Another issue was that of the analysis.  The EIR didn't contain an analysis of a possible project that would include both Transbay Terminal and the housing project at 80 Natoma. 


- There were questions about the cumulative impacts analysis. 


- And fourth, the EIR could have included more analysis of the project's impact on housing in San Francisco. 


- As a separate matter, the judge also was concerned that the Board of Supervisors did not have a fully fair and unbiased hearing on the matter. 


- Those are the issues that were raised in court on Tuesday. 


- They haven't seen a written order yet from the judge.  They will know more when they get that. 


- Her office was surprised and disappointed by the ruling. 


Commissioner Bradford Bell:


- She requested a briefing after the City Attorney has the ruling from the judge.

- This has been an ongoing issue.


- She is glad that the department and the Commission are moving forward on this.


- In reviewing the projects as they come through the neighborhoods, PDR is different now than what it was.  It is actually now a denser use.


Lou Blazej


- PDR services come from outside of the City.


- It is important to look at PDR and find out where the companies are coming from.


Bob Meyers


- This is a first step that has been long overdue.


- He would like to get a copy of report titled "option B."


Peter Cohen


- This is very good information.


- Has the available building space been evaluated?

Sue Hestor


- How are industrial uses depending on modes of transportation?


- It is important to factor in how people move throughout the City.


- Maybe the scoping should be extended beyond 5:00 p.m. tomorrow.

The project site is within an RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project.


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Beth Lewis - Discretionary Review Requestor


- She has lived in the neighborhood for about eight years.


- The project has not changed since November 18, 2004 when the Commission suggested that the case was not properly before them because of an illegal unit.


- Construction has begun and the illegal unit was removed without permits.


- She asked that the Commission not approve this project because there is still the probability that there would be an illegal unit constructed.


(-) Richard Lowden


- The Commission should take Discretionary Review on this project because the project sponsor and the contractors they hired cannot be trusted.


- The illegal unit was rented out.


- The plans submitted by the project sponsor did not include a bathroom on the lower level.


(+) Awin Chan - Project Sponsor


- He purchased his home 18 years ago and did not do any repairs until recently.


- He just wanted to do his best with the construction of his property.


- There was a tenant in the lower level but this person recently moved away.


- He hopes that the Commission will approve the project.

301 MISSION STREET
 - south side between Fremont and Beale Street, Lots 1 and 17 in Assessor's Block 3719 -
  Request under Planning Code Section 309 (Downtown Code) for Determinations of Compliance and an exception to rear yard requirements (Section 134(d)).
  The subject property is located within the C-3-O Zoning District as well as the 550-S and 400-S Height and Bulk Districts. The proposed project is to change the mix of uses and make minor changes to a portion of the building envelope on a previously approved mixed-use project, which was approved for 130,000 square feet of office space in a nine-story mid-rise building; 320 residential units and 120 extended stay hotel suites in a 58-story tower; 9,400 square feet of ground floor retail and 18,710 square feet of public and private open space contained within a base podium element; and four levels of below-grade parking.  The previously approved project was so conditioned that if in the judgment and at the discretion of the property owner, the hotel market did not sufficiently justify the operation of the proposed hotel facility, the 120 extended stay hotel units would be authorized for conversion to an equal number of residential units.  Therefore, the previously approved project was approved for a total of 440 dwelling units under specific conditions, all contained within the 58-story tower.  The modified project would eliminate the office and hotel uses, and would contain a total of 420 dwelling units, placing 54 of these units in the former 130,000 square-foot office building envelope, and 366 larger dwelling units would occupy the entire tower building envelope.  The ground level retail space would be reduced to 7,900 square feet, and there would be approximately 6,700 square feet of public open space, although with the removal of the office and hotel uses, no public open space is actually required by the Planning Code.   The proposed residential and retail uses would be contained in substantially the same building envelopes as were approved for the previous mixed-use project, with minor changes to the mid-rise building facade and a rear yard exception required for the dwellings within it.
