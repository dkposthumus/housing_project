1. Discuss Status of Planning Director Search.


Commission Secretary reported:


- She submitted three applications to the Commission.


- The announcement for the Planning Director was posted on:


1) The Department Website


2) The City Website


3) AIA and APA websites.  There is a cost to post on these websites.  The announcement would run four weeks and the cost is $250, which does not include the posting fee.  Unfortunately, there is no funding for this.


- She also submitted a list of other websites (with the cost associated to post) where the announcement could be posted.


Commissioner Antonini:


- He feels that it is important to do this and a means to find funding should be looked at; maybe Friends of City Planning?"


Commission Secretary responded:


- Friends of Planning has stated that they will not provide financial support for this endeavor.


Commissioner Sue Lee:


- Does the Department of Human Resources have a budget for this?


Commissioner Secretary responded:


- No, they do not.


PUBLIC COMMENT


At this time, members of the public may address the Planning Director Search Subcommittee on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Subcommittee. Each member of the public may address the Subcommittee for up to three minutes.


Ernestine Weiss


- She would like to know how many applicants have submitted their application and how many of these have been selected as candidates?


Commission Secretary responded:


- She has received seven applications so far.


- The Commission has not pinpointed any one candidate yet.


Ernestine Weiss


- How many applications should be submitted for the Commission to make a decision?


- The public is getting kind of anxious about this.


Commission Sue Lee:


- There is no "magic" number.


- She feels that the Commission is still "casting the net."  The Commission needs to make the decision thoughtfully.


Jeremy Nelson - Transportation for a Livable City


- He appreciates all the work that the Commission and the Commission Secretary are doing.


- To be able to choose from seven applicants would be fine but it would be good to get $500.00 to announce at different outlets.


- Plannetizen.com is a website that costs $65.00 for posting.  They have thousands of subscribers as well.  This would be a good place to announce.


- It is important to be creative to find other sources of funding.


- He understands that in addition to posting there are other issues to be dealt with like outreach to the Mayor and/or Board of Supervisors.


- He submitted an article from the New York Times about the Director of Planning of New York.


Adjournment: 1:50 p.m.


THESE MINUTES ARE PROPOSED FOR ADOPTION AT THE REGULAR MEETING OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON THURSDAY, MARCH 24, 2005.
