1840 WASHINGTON STREET
 - Assessor's Block 0599, Lot 008 - 
Appeal of Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration.  
The proposed project involves the construction of an approximately 45,238-gross-square-foot (gsf), eight-story, 80-foot-high residential building, which would include about 31,868 gsf of residential use (29 dwelling units), and 13,370 gsf of parking (35 off-street parking spaces).  The proposed project would also include the demolition of an existing 7,500 gsf, one-story-plus-mezzanine building formerly occupied by Teevan Restoration.  The approximately 7,021-square-foot (sf) project site is located mid-block on the north side of Washington Street between Van Ness Avenue and Franklin Street.  The site is zoned RC-4 (Residential-Commercial Combined District, High Density) and is in the Van Ness Special Use District, and an 80-D height and bulk district.  The proposed project would require conditional use authorization for new construction exceeding 40 feet in height in the Van Ness Special Use District, and a variance for one unit, which would not meet the dwelling unit exposure requirement.

7. Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner W. Lee:


Re:  Rincon Hill Plan


- He requested that the Commission Secretary write a letter commending the staff who worked on this plan and that a copy of this letter be placed in their personnel files.


Re:  Article in Sunday's Chronicle (5/8/05) titled:  The Ephemeral City, San Francisco has lost its middle class, become a 'theme park for restaurants,' and is the playground of the nomadic rich and restless leeches living off them by Joel Kotkin


- This article brings up interesting points.


- Most of the City will be developed in the next few years.  Is this what the City will look like in the year 2020?


- Is the City going to rely on tourism only?  Is the middle class going to be lost? Is the City taking the right approach in doing planning for the next two or three years?


- He requested that the Planning Department provide some guidance.  Perhaps the person who wrote this article can come to the Planning Commission and provide a question and answer session.


Interim Director Macris responded:


- He read the article also.


- John King wrote a response to Mr. Kotin's article.


- When one generalizes as Mr. Kotkin did, there is only a grain of truth.


- Various speakers could be invited.  Although some might request a fee but something can be arranged.


Commission Antonini:


- He would like the department to proceed [with setting something up.


Commissioner S. Lee:


- She feels that it is a worthy topic to discuss.  Maybe a larger forum should be planned.


Commissioner Hughes:


- Perhaps the author could be contacted and find out about fees and available dates and get this information to the Commission.


Commissioner Olague:


- This is a dialogue she has been hearing for awhile.  She agrees that this topic would be of great interest.


Interim Director Macris:


- He will speak with the Commission President and determine what forum would be best.


Commissioner Antonini:


Re:  Workforce Housing


- It is important to look at this.  The intent is not to make things harder for another group.


- The middle-income housing group is the one that has received the least amount of housing in the last few years.


Commissioner Hughes:


Re:  1420 Haight Street (heard under Public Comment on April 28, 2005)


- This project was denied by the Commission on April 21, 2005.  It was denied because an elevator was non compliant with the permit.


- The Commission requested additional information from the counsel for the project sponsor.


- Since that time, they did put in a submittal and in review of that submittal, there is one item of particular merit to warrant the rehearing. 


- What was in noncompliance was the elevator and the location of the elevator.  Now there is a jurisdictional issue as it relates to compliance with state regulations. 


- So he believes that this may impact what options the project sponsor had at that time. 


Zoning Administrator responded:


- The permit is still at the department and he has not made a determination on the Variance so it could be brought back before the Commission.


Commissioner Antonini:


- He agrees with bringing this back before them.


Commissioner W. Lee:


- He would be supportive of a rehearing.


Zoning Administrator responded:


- The case will be re-noticed and rescheduled.  All the affected parties will be notified.


Commissioner Olague:


Re: Enforcement


- Certain commitments are made that become part of the findings with certain projects.


- How are projects enforced once they leave the Commission?


Zoning Administrator responded:


- When a project is approved, how is it assured that the conditions of approval are applied as it is going into implementation?


- When conditions are placed on the operation of a project and a few years later it is not complying with the conditions of approval, how is this enforced?


- An informational hearing before the Commission can be scheduled to answer questions the Commission might have on this issue.


- He feels that the end of June or early July would be the aim.


C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
8. Director's Announcements


Interim Director Macris reported:


Re:  Hiring Program


- This is well underway.


- To date there have been six offers to fill the 21 vacancies that need to be completed.  Five of these six have accepted the offers.  Environmental Review will receive two, Citywide will receive 1 and Neighborhood Planning will receive three.


- The hiring program will continue until the 21 vacancies have been filled.


Re: Fee Analysis


- This is also well underway.


- There have been about 100 or so activities that the Department caries out that can be chargeable.


- This list could be made available to the Commission.


- July or early August will be when the analysis will be completed.


- The target is to have a new fee schedule by early next year.


Re:  How business is conducted


- There is another analysis going on regarding how the department can do business more efficiently.


Re:  Department of Building Inspection


- They need more space and he and others in the department are working on a plan to more the department into a single place instead of two (1660 Mission Street and 30 Van Ness).


- They are exploring the building immediately next door (1650 Mission Street).  This way, DBI can use the entire building at 1660 Mission Street.


Commissioner W. Lee:


- AIA and SPUR has a report that has very reasonable--easy steps to make the department more efficient.


Re:  In home access


- He would like to see a study done on how people from home can access the DBI/Planning system to view permit information.


Interim Director Macris:


- Staff is working on a contract to get someone to work with DBI and Planning on standardizing the computer programs so that someone can go on the internet and access a database on the history and status of permits.


Commissioner W. Lee:


- He would like the Department of Street Use and Mapping to be included.


Zoning Administrator responded:


DPW, Fire, Building and Planning will be involved in this.  A unified system will be implemented.


- This information will be available in July 2005.

9. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals


BOS - 


Zoning Administrator reported:


Re:  Audit Committee - Chinatown Economic Development Group


- He along with Alicia Jean-Baptiste and representatives from Park and Rec, Controllers and City Attorney's Office attended this meeting regarding the open space fund that was generated by 447 Battery Street.


- The Commission directed him to grant a Variance in affect that would allow payment to a non-profit group.  The money was not spent as it should have been.


- Of the $275,000, the City has received $162,000.  Park and Rec has received this money.  Staff is asking to account for $35,000 in administrative funds and about $40,000 that is short.


- Director Macris wrote a few letters asking for more information on the status of this $40,000.


- The CEDG responded that they did not have the money and were seeking it from the former Board.


- Staff will be meeting with the City Attorney and the Controller to determine what the next steps will be.


Re:  Medical Canabus Dispensary Moratorium


- The Mayor signed this into law in April--a 45 day moratorium which will expire next week.


- Supervisor Mirkarimi is asking for an extension.


- This legislation will come to the Planning Commission in the near future.


- Planning staff recommended a 6-month moratorium.


- Permits will not be processed right now, if there was one that had to be processed, the case would go into Discretionary Review.


BOA - 


Re:  141-143 Parnassus Avenue


- This was a dwelling unit merger and was denied by the Commission.


- The Board overturned the Commission +5-0 with the explanation that family housing is important and that the tenant had moved out voluntarily.


Re:  2169 Folsom Street


- The Commission did not hear this case but he thought it important to mention.


- There was one live work unit that wanted to expand.  He determined that live work cannot be expanded because they are non-conforming uses.  The Board overturned the denial of the building permit based upon his interpretation of the law because the space that was being used could be used as an artist studio or a gallery and not an expansion of the live work.


- He will take a closer look at the ordinance.


Re: 1921 Palou Avenue


- This project was before the Commission.  It was determined to expand a lightwell and the project was approved.


- The Board upheld the Commission +5-0.


Re:  Public Comment from April 28, 2005


- Ms. Sue Hestor spoke about case reports not being submitted to the Board of Appeals.


- He spoke to members of the Board and it is true that the information was not being submitted to the Board of Appeals.


- He has submitted a draft proposal to make sure that the procedure is working and that case material is being submitted to the Board of Appeals.


- It was suggested that when a motion is made, there should also be a summary of why the Commission took this action.  In other words, the Commission should state the reason why they are taking their action.  This would assist the case planner in defending the Commission's decision.


Commissioner W. Lee:


RE:  Chinatown Economic Development Group


- He made a disclosure that he was Chair of the Chinatown Economic Development Group appointed by Mayor Newsome.  After the first meeting he relinquished his seat but he is still a member.  So if there is any conflict with what the Planning Commission needs to do, he requested that staff seek advise from the City Attorney so they can guide him.


Commissioner Hughes:


Re:  Board of Appeals


- When the Commission receives information from staff and from the public and they develop policy, is the basis of an appeal to the Board of Appeals limited to an appeal based on procedure, based on misapplication of the policy or does the Board have broad discretion in that they simply in their opinion don't believe that the policy has merit and consequently can uphold an appeal and eliminate the existence of a policy?


Zoning Administrator responded:


- The Board of Appeals is not governed by the Commission's decision and can take into account the policy of the Commission but it is not their policy.


- The Board of Appeals can follow the laws but they can make their own decisions.  The Board can basically not follow the Commission's decision.


Commissioner Hughes:


- Even after all the work, the public comment, etc, the Board can still decide to act in conflict with the intent of the policy if in their view they believe this to be appropriate?


Zoning Administrator responded:


- Even if the Board had the same amount of input, they can come to a different conclusion.


City Attorney Boyajian responded:


- If the Commission feels strongly about this then it should be codified so that it binds the Board of Appeals.


- If the law is in the Planning Code, then the Planning Code binds them.


Commissioner Olague:


Re: Board of Appeals


- This is a poor characterization of the powers of the Planning Commission.


Zoning Administrator responded:


- He will be looking at this more closely.


Commissioner S. Lee:


- A hearing on this needs to be scheduled because there are many questions and concerns from the Planning Commission.


Commissioner Alexander:


- It is important to have a hearing with the Board of Appeals.


Commissioner Antonini:


- A session is already scheduled with the Board of Appeals.


- He also knows that there is a hearing on unit mergers as well.


Zoning Administrator responded:


- June 15 is the hearing date with the Board of Appeals at 5:30 p.m.


- Your policies on dwelling unit mergers and demolitions will be discussed.

- During his employment at the Planning Department, Mr. Samaha, received both a personal unsecured loan which totaled $106,200 as well a property at no cost on Webster Street from Mr. James Nunemacker.  Neither a waver of payment nor proof of payment has been filed with the Recorder's Office for the loan (She displayed documents related to these statements).


- His Statement of Economic Interest does not show this information either.


- Mr. Samaha and Mr. Nunemacker have not registered as domestic partners.


Steve St. Deny - Carpet Connection - Bayshore Merchant's Association


Re:  Home Depot


- He has a business on Bayshore Boulevard.


- The new structures on that street are large businesses.


- There are businesses that have left the area as well.


- He has had to move from the area because the customers that used to come to the area are missing.


- There doesn't seem to be any move to bring Home Depot to the area.


- Maybe an entire new school could have been built already with the revenue from the businesses in the area.


Courtney Clarkson


Re:  Planning Department Issues


- She has received a number of notices on preservation from the Planning Department.


- Usually Planning submits photographs on projects.


- Recently there has been talk about affordable housing.


- Smaller houses that are older are being replaced with large mansions.


- Planning needs to start taking a look at what constitutes affordable housing.

- The café does not have a license for spirits.


- ABC has received a number of complaints.


- His business is small so even a small fine hurts.


(-) Courtney Clarkson


- She owns a small business near this project.


- She has spent a few years renovating the building.


- Almost every time she goes to the building she notices that there is a large amount of liquor containers near the building.

- The neighborhood is full of bars and there is no need for another one.


(-) Brad Wilmore - Telegraph Hill Dwellers Association


- It is very difficult when there is a retail operation near a bar.  During the day everything is quiet and clean, but in the evenings, there is much trash and disturbance.

Request for a Determination of Compliance under Planning Code Section 309 and Request for Exceptions including an exception to the rear yard requirements as permitted in Section 134(d).
  The proposal is to convert approximately 7,000 square feet of office space on the fifth and sixth floors of the existing building to six dwelling units.  Previously, Section 309 approval was granted for the conversion of the mezzanine and the second through fourth floors from office space to 10 dwelling units.  Approval of the current proposal would result in a total of 16 dwelling units, including two BMR units.  There will be no physical expansion of the existing building.  The project site lies within a C-3-G (Downtown General Commercial) District and an 80-130-F Height and Bulk District.  The Zoning Administrator will hold a simultaneous hearing to consider a request for an off-street parking variance.

ZONING MAP AMENDMENTS TO CHANGE THE HEIGHT AND BULK DESIGNATIONS FOR ASSESSOR'S BLOCK 0195 (BOUNDED BY JACKSON STREET, WASHINGTON STREET, MONTGOMERY STREET AND KEARNY STREET)
 - 
Consideration of an Ordinance amending San Francisco Planning Code by repealing Section263.1
, which allows the Planning Commission to approve height up to 200 feet in the 65D-2 Height and Bulk District, and by amending the Zoning Map of the City and County of San Francisco, Sheet 1H, to change the height and bulk designation of Assessor's Block 0195, Lots 4, 5, 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16 from 65D-2 to 40-X and to change the height and bulk designations of the remaining assessor's blocks and lots within the 65D-2 Height and Bulk District from 65D-2 to 65-A, and making findings of consistency with the priority policies of Planning Code Section 101.1 and the General Plan.


Preliminary Recommendation: Approval 


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Supervisor Aaron Peskin - Sponsor of Legislation


- Washington Street has historically been the dividing line between the bulk and mass of downtown and the human scale of neighborhood environment of Jackson Square and Telegraph Hill.


- These are zoning battles that took place in the late 1960's. 


- In the late 1980's there was an up zoning that happened and nobody, not even people with the wisdom of Mr. Badiner, quite remember what happened, but that created the 65 D-200 which allows buildings up to 200 feet on the north side of Washington Street. 


- The legislation here before the Commission is designed simply to maintain the human scale environment north of Washington Street in accordance with the built environment that exists there. 


- Mr. Lord indicated that City College has indeed submitted a letter that indicates that they support the legislation and further warns that as a state institution, it is not binding upon them and any properties that they own. 


- He is available for questions and hopes that the Commission will recommend it to the Board of Supervisors. 


(-) Ron Lee - Chinatown Neighbors Association


- The height modification is not good for the neighborhood because it would discourage development.


- Development to improve old buildings and empty lots would increase revenue.


- This height limit would decrease property values.


(-) June Lee - Nob Hill Realty


- She read a letter from her client who is opposed to this height modification.


(-) Sun Tai Lum


- She spoke through an interpreter.


- She is opposed to the height modification.  It is not fair to the residents of the area.


(-) Dorothy Zhu


- She is opposed to the height modifications.  It is not fair and it is no good.


(-) Lawrence Lee


- He and his family own property in the area.


- The existing height laws are already in place and are fair.


- He is opposed to the height modifications.


- It is not fair to take away their development rights.


- It will also devalue the properties in the area.


(-) Mary Tam


- She owns property on Washington Street.


- This height modification is not fair.

 of Building Permit Application Nos. 2004.1105.8607 for installation of an emergency generator and pad with diesel fuel tank for KBHK television, 2004.1220.1816 for installation of an FM antenna for KNGY radio, on the north leg at the third level of Sutro Tower and, 2005.0125.3910 for installation of four receive only satellite dishes for KPIX TV-5.  This project lies within the RH-1, Residential House, One Family District and within a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and Approve with Conditions.


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Debra Stein


- There are a lot of issues that have been resolved in the last four years.


- Sutro Tower is a shared facility.


- The existing operations are not before the Commission today.


- This project complies with all standards.


- The alterations before the Commission today are minor.


- The antenna will not transmit harmful radiation.


(-) Eileen Bocken


- There are a number of diesel storage facilities at Sutro Tower already.


- There are about 200 antennae already at this location.


- It is not sound policy to have such a high concentration of the City's Telecommunications structures in one location.


- She recommends that this proposal be turned down.


(-) Christine Linenbach - Twin Peaks Improvement Association


- She requested that the City Attorney explain the scope of the appeal that was taken to the California State Court of Appeals.  


- The use permit clearly states that Sutro Tower is limited to one tower and one building. Currently the proposal is for two 15-foot diameter satellite dishes on top of a garage that was never part of the Conditional Use permit.  And this garage has never received authorization from the Zoning Administrator as being part of the Conditional Use.


- There are several questions of safety.  For example, why does the fuel tank have to be installed closest to residential homes and water supplies?  Why do the satellite dishes have to be 
on top
 of the garage?


- She requested that this hearing be continued so that this case can be heard before the Board of Appeals first and then before the Planning Commission.


(-) Everett Homebolt


- He is opposed to this proposal because he is concerned about the diesel facility.


- He believes that this will be a fire hazard.


- He is concerned about the flammable liquids.


- The affects of long-term exposure have not been fully explored.


- The seismic danger has not been completely discussed either.


(-) Walter Kaplan - Forest Knowles Association


- There was improper notice of this hearing.

- A CU authorization is required by this project.


- Staff states that this project is exempted from environmental review.


- He has provided the Commission a very important court case which deals with Planning priorities.


- The surrounding areas have hundreds of homes.


- Every addition to this project demands a separate finding.


(+) Jean Sasro - General Manager of Sutro Tower


- There are three phases to this project.


- There are representatives from all three stations here to speak.


- There was a very thorough investigation for the location of the generator and the fuel tank.


- The location is the closes to KBHK so that the lines are as close as possible.


- The satellite antennas are being located on top of the garage so that they will receive signals properly.


(+) Steve Boycons - Station Manager for KBHK-TV


- He has been in television for many years.


- They are part of the CBS team.


- They are planning to expand their coverage.


(+) Joe Balus - KNGY Owner


- He is an independent broadcaster and owner.


- His company has gone through great length to do market research and find out what is underserved.


- The two communities that are underserved are the Chinese and Gay communities.


- The proposal will allow for a better platform and provide better access to the communities.


- He is available for further questions.


(+) Chris Boyle - Chief Marketing Officer of The United Way


- Their partnership with CBS-5 is very important.


- They have a holiday food program, which provides much needed toys and food during the holiday season.


(+) Booker Raid


- Their mission is multiculturalism.


- They have various programs in various locations.


- This has been a tremendously burdensome process.


(+) Bob McCarthy


- The history of the tower is not before the Commission.


- What is before the Commission is just a minor antenna.


- Television plays a major role in communication and not just entertainment.


- It is important to preserve free television in the United States.

SPEAKE(S):


Eileen Boken - SPEAK


Re:  1234 19
th
 Avenue


- This proposed demolition of a pre-1906 Victorian came before the Commission previously.


- The Commission rejected the proposed demolition and SPEAK was the main opponent to this demolition. 


- Just last week this appeal came before the Board of Appeals and the Commission's determination was overturned. 


- SPEAK was not at this hearing to state the case against demolition. 


- When trying to figure out what went so terribly wrong, she spoke with the legal assistant of the Board of Appeals.


- The first thing mentioned to her was that the Board of Appeals did not receive a copy of the project file from the Planning Department. 


- The Board of Appeals did not see the same information that the Commission did when the Commission made its determination. 


- The board based its decision primarily on information provided by the project sponsor. 


- Also, because the Board of Appeals did not receive the project file, they also did not receive a list of interested parties so notification was only sent to immediate neighbors. 


- SPEAK did not receive notification even though it was the primary opponent to the proposed demolition. 


- The findings of the appeal will be heard on May 18, 2005.


- she requested that the Commission instruct the Zoning Administrator to issue a formal request for a rehearing before May 18.


- Also, she requested that the Commission instruct the Planning Department to forward a copy of the project file to the Board of Appeals.
