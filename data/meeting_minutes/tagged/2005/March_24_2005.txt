  Request under Planning Code Section 309 (Downtown Code) for Determinations of Compliance and an exception to rear yard requirements (Section 134(d)).
  The subject property is located within the C-3-O Zoning District as well as the 550-S and 400-S Height and Bulk Districts. The proposed project is to change the mix of uses and make minor changes to a portion of the building envelope on a previously approved mixed-use project, which was approved for 130,000 square feet of office space in a nine-story mid-rise building; 320 residential units and 120 extended stay hotel suites in a 58-story tower; 9,400 square feet of ground floor retail and 18,710 square feet of public and private open space contained within a base podium element; and four levels of below-grade parking.  The previously approved project was so conditioned that if in the judgment and at the discretion of the property owner, the hotel market did not sufficiently justify the operation of the proposed hotel facility, the 120 extended stay hotel units would be authorized for conversion to an equal number of residential units.  Therefore, the previously approved project was approved for a total of 440 dwelling units under specific conditions, all contained within the 58-story tower.  dwelling units under specific conditions, all contained within the 58-story tower.  The modified project would eliminate the office and hotel uses, and would contain a total of 420 dwelling units, placing 54 of these units in the former 130,000 square-foot office building envelope, and 366 larger dwelling units would occupy the entire tower building envelope.  The ground level retail space would be reduced to 7,900 square feet, and there would be approximately 6,700 square feet of public open space.   The proposed residential and retail uses would be contained in substantially the same building envelopes as were approved for the previous mixed-use project, with minor changes to the mid-rise building facade and a rear yard exception required for the dwellings within it.

7.  Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner W. Lee:


Re:  SB 1818 - Density Bonus


- He would like an update on this state bill.


Commissioner Hughes:


Re:  Letter to the Board of Realtors


- A member of the public asked the Commission to request that staff write a letter to the Board of Realtors, which lays out the demolition policy.


- Next week he would like to ask staff about this.  He mentions this today so that everyone can think about it.


Commissioner Antonini:


Re:  Rincon Hill, Transbay and Mid-Market


- He was pleased with the Mayor's press conference on these issues.


- It would be instructive to have a list of the number of units in San Francisco that are either public housing or designated below market rate units.


City Attorney Kate Stacey responded:


- Commissioner Antonini, last week, asked a question regarding:  What actions the Board of Supervisors send over to the Commission.


- The Board of supervisors sends any amendments of the Planning Code to the commission for review.


- Other actions are not required to be referred to the Planning Commission unless it is environmentally related that would fall under CEQA.


- A Supervisor could request input from the Planning Commission.  This would be submitted to the Planning Department and then presented to the Planning Commission.


- Regarding interim zoning controls: the Board can take those actions without referral to the Planning Commission for input.  The matter is referred over to the Planning Director under CEQA review but does not require action by the Planning Commission.


Commissioner Antonini:


- Can a Planning Commission make a request of the Board of Supervisors?


City Attorney Kate Stacey responded:


Yes.

Mandatory Discretionary 
                Review
 of Miscellaneous Permit Application Number MB0500372, 
                a Zoning Referral from the California Department of Alcoholic 
                Beverage Control (ABC). The proposal would change the use of a 
                vacant approximately 6,000 square foot ground floor space to a 
                full-service restaurant and bar (DBA "Tres Agaves") 
                which would sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on-site. 
                The balance of the structure (approximately 3,500 square feet) 
                would be used as an art gallery. No physical expansion or increase 
                in exterior dimensions of the existing building is proposed. Planning 
                Commission Resolution Number 14844 requires a Discretionary Review 
                hearing for all projects which involve a new or relocated liquor 
                license or bar within the proposed Ballpark Vicinity Special Use 
                District (BVSUD). The property is located in an SSO (Service / 
                Secondary Office) District, the proposed BVSUD, the South End 
                Historic District, and a 50-X Height and Bulk District.

329 BAY STREET
 - Appeal of a Preliminary Mitigated Negative 
          Declaration
. The project site is on the south side between Mason 
          and Powell Streets, with street frontage also on Vandewater Street, 
          on Lot 036 in Assessor's Block 0041. The proposed project is the demolition 
          of an existing one-story, 8,550 square-foot retail building, and the 
          construction of a 40-foot tall four-story building that would contain 
          21 residential units, approximately 2,000 square feet of ground level 
          retail, plus a one-level basement garage with 21 spaces with access 
          from Vandewater Street. The approximately 39,000 gross square-foot building 
          would cover the 8,640 square-foot site. The ground floor retail space 
          would face Bay Street. Pedestrian access would be from Bay and Vandewater 
          Streets. One mature street tree would be removed on the Vandewater Street 
          frontage of the site and replaced with two new street trees. The site 
          is zoned C-2 (Community Business District), in the Northern Waterfront 
          Special Use District #2, and a 40-X Height and Bulk District. The project 
          would require a Variance from 
Planning Code
 rear yard requirements. 
        






Preliminary Recommendation: Uphold Mitigated Negative Declaration






SPEAKER(S):


Re: Continuance


Sue Hestor


- There has been a difficult time getting the main project before the 
          Commission.


- The neighbors of the project want to get this hearing before the 
          Commission but they cannot file for a Discretionary Review without there 
          being an actual project.


- Everything should be heard together so she recommends that this be 
          continued to some time in April.


David Cincotta


- There is no reason to delay any action or decision today.


- All the issues dealing with the tree can be discussed with regard 
          to the permit and the Variance.


NOTE: Motion to continue to April 14, 2005 did not receive a second 
          and did not move forward for the vote.


Re: Point of Clarity


Sue Hestor


- The permit was has been issued so it is impossible to file a Discretionary 
          Review.


- It is important to discuss all aspects of the tree at one time.


- This is not an abnormal request. It is a natural process.


Re: Merits of Project


Catherine Petrin - Appellant


- She is representing many other neighbors who could not be here today.


- The neighbors did not oppose the project. They support the Negative 
          Declaration issued in 2004.


- If the project would reflect the information of the first Negative 
          Declaration, they would not be here.


- She displayed a block and lot map showing the location of the project.


- She displayed photographs of the tree in question.


- There are certified arborists that state that the tree still has 
          a long life. The tree only suffers from a lack of maintenance.


- The project sponsor has not maintained or pruned the tree.


- She asked the Commission to help preserve this historic tree.


Wendy Hampton - Vandewater Neighbors


- The Planning Department has not done a normal process of investigation 
          for this type of project but is basing its findings on the recommendation 
          of an arborist.


- If this Negative Declaration is approved, the neighbors will protest 
          against the project and the Variance decision.


- This project should accommodate Vandewater's unique character


Stan Lyon


- The rear yard is related to saving the tree.


- He is puzzled. When the developer presented the project to a neighborhood 
          group, he stated that the tree would be preserved.


- If this were the case, the project would have been moved forward 
          with no damage to the roots of the tree.


Carolyn Blair - Tree Council


- They would not be here if the proposal to protect tree would have 
          been accepted.


- They hired unbiased arborists to make a determination on the tree.


- She asked the Commission to follow through with their requirements 
          to preserve trees.


(+) David Cincotta - Project Sponsor


- He understands the resident's concerns about the tree.


- This is not the process to deal with this issue. None of the speakers 
          addressed the Negative Declaration.


- In order to protect the tree it would need 30 feet of clear space.


- The City's arborist determined that the tree was in bad condition.


- The tree has nothing to do with the Variance.


- The tree does not satisfy the mid-block open space.


- The issues here have to deal with the Environmental Impact report.


- The decision has been delayed for five months already.


- The tree is dangerous even if the project did not go forward because 
          it has significant decay.

Deborah Densler


Re:  Dangerous Sidewalks and a Residential Hotel Task Force


- She is concerned that there are tree roots causing parts of sidewalks to rise.


- She fell near the Gough Street area because of this.


- She is wondering if a task force was formed for residential hotels.


Commissioner Olague responded:


- She recommended that Ms. Densler speak to the assistant of Supervisor Tom Amiano regarding this.


Sue Hestor


Re:  Notice for C2 Projects


- There is no notice for projects in these areas and she is concerned about this.
