5800 Third Street Residential and Commercial Mixed-Use Project
- Appeals of Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration
 
- The proposed project would consist of construction of a residential and commercial mixed-use development after demolition of a defunct bottling plant facility at 5800 Third Street (Assessor’s Block 5431A, Lot 001), at the southwest corner of Third Street and Carroll Avenue in the Bayview neighborhood.
 
 The project would include 355 multi-family residential units in four buildings, 13,000 gross square feet (gsf) of ground floor retail space in two of the buildings that would be along Third Street, and 379 off-street
 
parking spaces in the four buildings. The four buildings would total 641,920 gsf in size, ranging in height from 50 to 60 feet tall (four to five stories) and would be built around a central plaza and a private driveway with two visitor loading spaces, with access from Carroll Avenue.
 
 Sixteen surface parking spaces for the retail uses would be provided on the south side of the project site, with access provided from a right-turn-only driveway on Third Street at the southern boundary of the site.
 
 Twenty surface parking spaces for visitors would be provided along the central private driveway.
 
 Currently, the 5.75-acre site is occupied by a three-story, 103,000-gsf closed Coca-Cola bottling plant constructed in 1966, which would be demolished. Current use of the site is temporary parking of moving company trucks and charter buses.
 
 The site is within an M-1 (Light Industrial) District, the Third Street Special Use District (SUD), a 65-J Height and Bulk District, and the proposed Bayview Hunters Point Redevelopment Projects and Zoning Health Center Activity Node.
 
 The project would require Conditional Use Authorization for a Planned Unit Development and for residential uses in an M-1 District by the Planning Commission, which is a public hearing process.

COMMISSIONERS’ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS

 Commission Comments/Questions


 


Commissioner Olague:


Re:
 
To get a better understanding of First Source Hiring, she requested an informational hearing.


 


     
 Zoning Administrator – Larry Badiner responded:




We’ll be happy to do that.




                             
 -
    
 
The Department needs to deal with the implementation of First Source Hiring and some issues have been brought to our attention.




A hearing on this issue from the administrator of the program, Don Haza, would be very useful.




 


 


Commissioners Olague:




Spoke briefly with the Mayor’s Office of Community Development and they have some pilot programs in the works.
 
 It might be good to also have them present to give us some information about these programs.




 


Re: Article in the Chronicle July 21, 2005, “City 5000 units behind Affordable Housing Goal “




Based on report, how can the Department be part of the solution instead of constantly hearing about the problem?




 


           
 
Dean Macris – Director of Planning responded:




If the Commission really wants an end to this, we probably should have Matt Franklin come to the Commission and explain the approach that the Mayor’s Office is using on this.




                      


                      
 
Re: Octavia-Market Plan




Would like to talk to the City Attorney or member of staff regarding density bonuses.




                                   


                      
 
             
 
Dean Macris – Director of Planning responded:




Asked her to come by the Department to have an informal discussion about.




 


                      
 
Commissioner W. Lee:




Thanked Marshall Foster regarding his presentation to the San Francisco Business Times, which discusses affordable housing.




 
 
 
 -
     
 Agreed with facts that this Planning Commission actually approved more affordable housing units than any other Commission that we can remember.




We are creating more affordable housing.
 
 The public needs to understand that before this Commission was formed, we were only producing 1000 units a year.
 
 It is very difficult to get 5000 affordable housing units.
                 


Strongly recommended that Mathew Franklin, Mayor’s Office of Community Development come to the Commission and explain the funding he has available to promote more affordable housing.




 


Commissioner Bradford-Bell:




Asked Director Macris to schedule Eastern Neighborhoods on September 8 because she is not going to be attending the meeting of September 1.




 


     
 Dean Macris – Director of Planning responded:




The Department’s plan was to make a presentation on the Eastern Neighborhoods Interim Controls, on September 8, 2005




 


                       
 Commissioner Antonini:


        
 -
    
 In terms of comments by Commissioner Olague, I agree it would be interesting to see what part--not in terms of the affordable /inclusion component but at the market rate housing--what part of the process is responsible for the cost.




Hotel/Condo conversion issue:
 
 there are couple of projects today that are coming to us that involve a change of usage, which is really common.
 
 This seems to be a change of usage issue and it seems to be a Planning issue.
 
 Now at the Land Use Committee there was a discussion and a ruling, or at least an illusion to a ruling by the City Attorney, that it was proper for the Board of Supervisors to by-pass the planning process and the Board to be able to put through legislation that would prohibit this type of conversion.


Would like to hear or get something in writing regarding this issue.




 


 


                                               
 
Susan Cleveland-Knowles – Deputy City Attorney’s Office responded:




Will report to the Commission next week (August 4, 2005)




                      


                      
 
Commissioner Olague:


-
    
 In a lot of the issue brought here, we hear frequently that the more housing that’s built will bring the cost of housing down in the City.
 
 Are there any studies available that give credit to that theory?


 


Dean Macris – Director of Planning responded:


-
  
 
We’ll be glad to look into it.


 


Commissioner W. Lee:




Regarding following Commissioner Antonini’s comments about the conversion of the Fairmont Hotel, I sit on the Convention Visitors Bureau and represent the City. There was accurate information by Supervisor Peskin’s office where he estimated that about 61,300 jobs are associated with hotel rooms.
 
 We have about 32, 000 hotel rooms, but the data is not totally relevant because only about 25 percent of our work force is tied to the hotel industry.


An email was sent to Supervisor Peskin yesterday by the Convention and Visitor’s Bureau to clarify that it is not two workers per hotel room but a lot less than that.

SPEAKERS:
    


Jim Ruben – Representing Project Sponsor




We have been working with the sponsor for a number a years regarding these buildings.


As you by now are aware, the proposal was to modify a two-story addition to the existing three-story Berry Street Building.
 
 The goal was to accommodate the rapidly developing science industry.


With the increasing demand and excitement developed by the Stem Cell Research Center across the street, we are confident this is the right project at the right time.




Paul Wolfer – Project Architect


-
  
 Gave an overall description of the project


Jeffrey Leibovitz – Rincon Point South Beach Advisory Committee




Commended the developer/project sponsor for agreeing to move the imposing gates on Third and Fourth Streets.
 
 And also agreeing that if for security reasons they find the necessity to put the gates back up, they agree to notify the neighborhoods at least 3 – 12 months in advance so we [the neighborhoods] can be involved.




                       
 
Corrine Woods




Extremely concerned about the parking exemption this Project Sponsor wants.


Suggested that the Project Sponsor be required to periodically survey China Basin Landing tenants to update the demand analysis contained in the Wilbur Smith China Basin Landing Parking Study and provide the community with studies reflecting current conditions.


Another issue is environmental health and safety.




Greg Cosko




This is a great commercial building opportunity for the City of San Francisco.




Jim Salinas




This project would impact the City in a very positive way.




 


ACTION:
          
 Approved with modified amendments:


19.
 
 According to Planning Code Section 313.3(a) where an environmental evaluation application for the development project is filed on or after January 1, 1999, the required fees shall apply.
 
 The environmental application for the subject property was filed on April 20, 1998, and the EIR was certified on Feb. 17, 2000.
 
 The project is grandfathered under Section 313.3(a) and S.F. Administrative Code Section 38.3(E)(5), and the Project Sponsor is not required to pay the Jobs-Housing Linkage fee or the Transit Impact fee.


 


However, the Project Sponsor shall make a voluntary contribution of a portion of the fees that would otherwise apply if the project was not exempt.


 


According to the standards for a new project, the required fee would be:


Transit Impact


49,000 square feet of office space X $10.21 = $500,290


101,982 square feet of R & D space X $10.21 = $1,041,236.20


Total amount for a new project = $1,541,526.20


Proposed amount = $652,568


 


Jobs-Housing Linkage Fee


49,000 square feet of office space X $14.96 = $733,040


101,982 square feet of R & D space X $9.97 = $1,016,760.50


Total amount for a new project = $1,749,800.50


Proposed amount = $874,900.25


 


Total proposed amount = $1,527,468.20


 


The Project Sponsor shall remove the existing gates at each end of the wharf prior to issuance of a building permit for the subject property.
 
 In the event that the gates must be installed for security purposes, the Project Sponsor shall give notice of the request to all owners and neighborhood organizations within a 300-foot radius of the subject property, and the proposal must be approved by the Zoning Administrator by a letter of determination.

-
Public Hearing to receive comments on the Draft Environmental Impact Report.
 
 The project site on Assessor’s Block 3547, on Lots 2A, 3, 4, and 29 is approximately 51,888 sf in size and contains two existing buildings containing warehouse use and printing plant with offices.
 
 The project site is located at 1880-1886 Mission Street at 15th Street (northwest corner) bordered by 14th Street to the north, Mission Street to the east, 15th Street to the south and Julian Street to the west, within the Mission District neighborhood.
 
 The project site is located in a Heavy Commercial (C-M) zoning district, within a 65-B/50-X Height and Bulk district, as well as the Mission District Interim Controls district. The proposal is to demolish the two existing buildings and construct one seven-story plus basement building containing 194 dwelling units, including 39 affordable units, and 8,536 square feet (sf) of retail space.
 
 The basement and ground floor levels would contain 181 parking spaces with ingress and egress from 15th Street.
 
 The proposed project would require conditional use authorization by the Planning Commission pursuant to San Francisco Planning Code Section 303.
 


NOTE
: 
 
 The Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was published on June 25, 2005.
 
 This Planning Commission hearing is to receive comments on the adequacy, accuracy, objectivity and completeness of information in the Draft EIR.
 
 Written comments on the Draft EIR will be accepted at the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m. on Monday, August 1, 2005.


           


SPEAKERS:
    


Brett Gladstone – Representing Project Sponsor




Landmarks Board had no sentiments about keeping this building and had no problem with its demolition.




Toby Levine




She sees absolutely no reason to not approve it and go forward.




Jose Moreno




Strongly urged the Commission to certify the findings of the Draft Environmental Impact Report.




Roberta Gabino




Supports the project




My Do


- Supports the project


Oscar Grande - MAC




.
 
One of the other areas that we feel should be addressed is land use—specifically, the character of the vicinity
.




Chris Selig - MAC




Talked about the historical significance of the building.
 
 Not in the sense that was already referred to.
 
 Nor in the façade or the architectural design.
 
 But in terms of the actually use.


There is very limited number of large floor palate units in San Francisco right along the Mission left.
 
 And there is the kind of industry that needs this kind of space in order to function.
 
 And we continue to demolish these spaces for primarily market rate housing.
 
 It doesn’t do anybody any good.
 
 It doesn’t provide living space for people with working class jobs.




William Smith




Preserving this building will not preserve jobs.
 
 The jobs are already gone.




Frank Martin del Campo




Spoke in favor of this project




Phillip Lesser




This is going to be a transformational project for the Mission District.




Ruben Santana

Market & Octavia Neighborhood Plan
 
- 
Public Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Report
:
 
 
T
he project area is located in the central city neighborhoods along Market Street from about 9
th
 Street to the east to Noe Street to the west, north along the former Central Freeway alignment at Turk Street, and south along Howard and Sixteenth Streets.
 
 The project site encompasses about 85 city blocks.
 
 
The proposed neighborhood plan would reclassify the existing zoning from Residential (R), Neighborhood Commercial Districts (NCD’s), Heavy Commercial (C-M), and Downtown General Commercial (C-3-G) Districts to Residential Transit Oriented (RTO), Neighborhood Commercial Transit (NCT), and Downtown Residential (DTR) Districts. It would also increase height limits in certain areas and reduce the existing height limits in other areas.
 
 The proposed zoning and height reclassifications would increase the potential for residential development in the area.


Note: Written comments will be received at the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m. on August 9th, 2005.


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 No action required.

491 BAYSHORE BOULEVARD - HOME DEPOT
 
 
 -
 
Certification of a Final Environmental Impact Report
 
- Subsequent to the publication of the Draft EIR the project
 
sponsor identified a new preferred project. The revised project re-orients the location of the parking garage and the store itself, so that the parking garage is located on the southern end of the project site and the store is located on the northern end of the project site, but the effects would be similar to those analyzed for the original project in the Draft EIR.
 
 The home improvement center would be
 
approximately 153,089 square feet
, the same size as the original project
.
 
The store would include approximately 95,600 square feet of retail on the main floor, approximately 37,700 square feet of retail on the second floor, approximately 9,900 square feet of enclosed greenhouse space, and approximately 9,900 square feet of open garden center space. The separate parking garage would consist of two levels plus rooftop parking, totaling approximately 247,800 square feet and would include 555 parking spaces.
 


The proposed project consists of demolition of two vacant buildings, totaling 107,346 square feet on this 5.73-acre site. The proposed buildings would be approximately 40 feet in height. Vehicular access to the parking garage would be from Bayshore Boulevard with secondary access on Loomis Street. The project is located within the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood. The proposed project would not require a conditional use authorization, however a staff-initiated discretionary review is before the Planning Commission. The site is within the adopted Industrial Protection Zone (IPZ) Special Use District and is located in a M-1 (Light Industrial) zoning district and within a 65-J height and bulk district.


Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the Final Environmental Impact Report.


                       
 
NOTE: The public review period for the Draft Environmental Impact Report ended at 5:00 pm, July 11, 2005.

SPEAKERS:


Joseph Smooke

 The Primary issue we have with this proposal is the role that Home Depot played in driving a wedge between two neighborhoods




It seems that if they build a smaller store at this location it will certainly go a long way towards bringing our communities together; to actually provide a promise of jobs and mitigate the environmental impacts.


There is also a question about the jobs.
 
 First of all, the First Source Hiring agreement is not enforceable.
 
 There are no penalties if Home Depot does not comply. This is a very bad deal, especially considering the negative environmental impact.


The developers are acting in their own self-interest rather than in the interest of the community. Because if they were acting in the interest of the community, they would make a gesture to reduce the size of the store, which would reduce the environmental impact and provide quality jobs and an enforceable jobs agreement with the City.




Anna Shemko – Cassidy, Shemko and Dobson




This store on Bayshore Boulevard will bring much needed goods and services to City residents.


It will revitalize the Bayshore Commercial Corridor.


It will create hundreds of new jobs in the City and will employ at least 150 entry level employees from the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood and surrounding areas.


It will help the City with sales tax, property tax, and payroll taxes.


We will pay the housing fee on the entire square footage of the Home Depot proposal.


This project complies with all the physical standards of the code.


We have held numerous meetings with organizations within the Bernal Heights Neighborhood.


Bernal Heights Neighborhood Center and the Cortland Avenue Merchants have refused our recent offers of further briefing or discussions.


There is absolutely no evidences that Home Depot will cause hardware stores in the City to suffer economic loses.


Three separate studies showing that San Francisco is loosing home improvement sales to the tune of over $300,000.000 a year leaves plenty of room for Home Depot and existing and future businesses to thrive.


Home Depot will generate at least $400.000 dollars per year in sales tax revenue and $100,000 dollars per year in payroll taxes.




Frank Kota, Architect for the project




Gave an overall review and description of the project’s design.




Steven Currie




Spoke in favor of the project




Valdez




This project will help our communities.
 
 If we work together it will be valuable and meaningful for all residents and Home Depot.




Mary Harris – President, District 11 Council




Is in favor of this project.




Unclear name




Home Depot will not have a negative impact in our neighborhood when you consider that anything is better than what we got.
 
 It is not out of scale with the neighborhood, and property values will not go down.




Michael Hammond




We want the opportunity to pursue jobs and prosperity the same as they do in every other neighborhood.




Chris Witterman




Opposes the project.

This will be a huge store that impacts our neighborhood.
