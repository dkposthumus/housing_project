 Commission Comments/Questions


 


Commissioner Antonini:




Gave a general statement regarding calendaring items on our agenda.


Would like to explored the possibility of beginning our commission sessions a bit earlier in the day so we are finished a little earlier, or at least we’re able to concentrate a little better instead of getting into the late hours and facing the unfortunate choice of either continuing items that have been continued many times and are very sensitive.


Would like know how other commissioners feel about this and maybe for next year we can start to look at room availability or other possible scenarios where we could pick up an hour to an hour and a half earlier on most Thursdays to hopefully get through our calendar a little bit earlier in the evening.

- which was an existing older building, was not rated architecturally, but it was a handsome older building.
 
 We felt that was not appropriate based upon the residential design guidelines that say to replace windows with windows that are in kind and in context with the original building.
 
 The permit was issued and approved.
 
 The Board of Appeals upheld the soundness issue, which is very gratifying. We’ve had problems in the place on replacement windows.
 
 We feel they are very important.
 
 The board upheld us.

Re: 900 Innes Avenue




This item has been on the calendar consistently from the end of May.


It was continued for 45 days and you asked leaders of the preservation community, specifically qualified professionals to come and tell you whether we thought the document was adequate.


It has been too long on the calendar and will need to be re-advertised




Jim Salinas Sr.




Referred back to a statement that was made a couple weeks ago in the Planning Commission Chambers.


Commissioner Olague was gracious and respectful enough to submit an apology, to staff and to the public.

David Cincotta, representing Discretionary Review Requestor




Regrets that we are here today because we have made some progress with these projects.
 
 Unfortunately we have not made sufficient progress.


The size of the penthouse is down a third from what it used to be.
 
 It its down to what a normal mechanical penthouse might be.


The project is still too tall for its site.
 
 It is too large.


There are considerable things that could be done to make it better.


All structures on that street are one-story or two-story cottages.


The impact on the adjacent property is really considerable.




Sandra Whittman




Owner of 1853 Scott Street,


There are two facades--Victorian cottages with a party wall.


People move in and they only move out if they are forced to move out by some other significant event in their life.


They have a lot of light and they are very livable


The owner expects the City and the people of San Francisco to pay for his investment in the lack of a historically significant building.
 
 He also expects me to move all these pipes which I have an easement for, which costs somewhere between $60 and $80 thousand rather than solve it with a lightwell.


We have to put in a lightwell.
 
 We have to put in ventilation for the bathroom.
 
 We have to put in a skylight.




Andrew Junius, representing Project Sponsor




My client’s project is on a 16-foot wide lot.


We have no room to make a lightwell.


We cannot accommodate a waste line over the property line.


We are willing to put the money out there and make that line go into the building.


My client has been very cooperative.


This issue is not for the Planning Commission.
 
 It is a dispute between property owners.


They have no right to that property line window and there is not a significant shadow issue related to this addition.




Brian Growner, Property Owner




This building was in a teardown condition.


The façade has been restored to its exact condition in 1894.


The lightwell that I proposed matches her lightwell as per the Building Code.


Asked the Commission to deny the Discretionary Review application.

Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions


 


              
 SPEAKERS:


              
 
Dean Ricci




Clarified that we are not a financial institution.
 
 We are a professional service that is more closely related to a real estate brokerage. The Zoning Administrator made this determination.


We feel that we are a valuable asset to the community and greatly improve the retail environment on the street.




Sharon Green




Strongly protests the proposed project


Extremely concerned about the possible loss of retail business in the area.




 


              
 
Leonard Norak




Opposes the project




Bob Singer




Spoke in favor of the project.




Patricia Clark




We need diversity in retail to provide the every day goods and services that families require on a day-to-day basis.




Timothy John McCarthy




Asked and urged the Commission to support their conditional use authorization for Guarantee Mortgage to make their move in the neighborhood.




              
 
Miles Grant




Thinks that this will bring a lot of business and a lot of people into the West portal area that did not know about it.


This will be a very positive impact on the neighborhood.




Dan Saunders




His fear is if Guarantee Mortgage is not allowed to move to the new location, they will move off the street.
 
 This will cause him and his business a lot of increased pressure and hopefully that won’t happen.

Read a letter from Mathew Rodgers, a current merchant in West Portal who supports this project.


It is a misnomer to say this is a financial institution.
 
 We are governed by the Department of Real Estate not the Department of Financial Institutions.


Would like the Commission to grant the conditional use request.

Banks opening on West Portal Avenue would be positive for the neighborhood.


This will be a small institution.


This is a community organization.


The Planning Code allows for limited financial services in this neighborhood and none have been opened.

Do not approve the conditional use application.

Asked the Commission to approve the application.




Patricia Clark




There are already too many financial offices in the neighborhood.




Kenneth Crusca, West Portal Association




Opposed to the project.




Ray Doyle




People should have property rights.


The community rights should not be overridden.


The right to request a conditional use permit was designed to build flexibility.


The neighborhood commercial district zoning restrictions are one tool to protect small businesses


Please do not dismantle this protection.




Steve Adams, Managing Director of Sterling Bank in San Francisco




Is in support of this project.




Mary Ann Christian




Ground floor retail space is prime in West Portal


We need to encourage new small Businesses to come into that space


Is not in support of this project.




Ernestine Weiss




This is healthy.


[Banks] fill a need


If there weren’t a need, they wouldn’t be asking you to have them there.


Things change in neighborhoods.

 SPEAKERS:


              
 
Warner Smalls, Property Owner




We want to make it clear that for three years, which has been a long time for us, we have listened expressly to the concerns of the community.


I think it is in that spirit that we are proposing this project as modified today.


We have increased the number of three bedroom unit, we’ve added more, not by increasing the size of the building, but simply by adjusting the interior spaces to provide for more bedrooms that are truly legal, in terms of bedroom, light and air exposure.


This makes a big change in the number of people, the number of population that can be accommodated in the building.


We’ve increased the number of units to 194


We have provided new community space.


We’ve reduced the number of parking to below the 1.1 legally required for independent access.


We think this is a socially responsible project.


We’ve waited five years since this project was conceived and have been in the pipeline for three years.


Respectfully asked the Commission for their support and approval of the project




Name unclear




Appreciated the support of the Planning Department staff and the Planning Commission for the past five years.


Our main concern has been to make this project inclusionary.




Gloria Diana Ramos




This project will provide homeownership to about 39 low-income families who are probably all tenants at the moment.


This is something critically important.


She is very proud of that, and happy to know that low-income families will be homeowners and no longer have to rent.




Ron Miguel




There are overriding considerations for your approval of this project.
 
 Just take a look at what has been achieved here. Neighborhood group considerations particularly regarding retail, streetscape, traffic and everything else has been thoroughly taken into consideration.
 
 It’s probably more than most developers have done in being responsible to the neighborhood.




Ruben Santana




I currently employ approximately 50 union carpenters and laborers.
 
 75 to 80% are local from the community and/or San Francisco residents.


My organization is that of grassroots of this city and I’d like to see the city develop and become a stronger unification with all the people involved.


Is in favor of this project.




Tim Paulson, Executive Director of the San Francisco Labor Council




Asked the Commission to push this project forward.


Commended the Commission for the work they’ve done so far.




Michael Therianlt




Thanked the project sponsor for pledging to build the project with all union labor.


We have a legitimate hope that some of our own members may eventually occupy those units.




Roberta Gabino




Asked the Commission to support the project.
 
 It will create good union paying jobs as well as provide much needed affordable housing.




Jose




The building that is there serves no real purpose and has little value


You can help solve the problem by supporting this project and move it forward.




Larry Mizzola, Jr.




The type of project you are considering tonight will help me and my people in the community secure permanent housing.


This is the type of project in the Mission District that will allow people in my community to keep current economic status with construction jobs.




Jose Ferreira, Jr.




We have over 3300 members in our union.
 
 This project will provide work for some of those members.
 


I’m here to support the project and the housing that will be developed


Asked the Commission to support this project and move it forward.




Robert Crockett, Local 22




This project will help bring a dead neighborhood back to life.


I’d like to work on it to help the people of the neighborhood to improve it, to give them a reason to have faith, hope, and just a little bit of pride in their neighborhood so they will want to live there.




Don Marcos




I have supported the project since it was proposed three years ago, before they made all the changes, simply because of what it will do in that neighborhood.


Every month, every year that this project is delayed, it is one more crime, one more victim, and one more family not being able to move in.




Joseph Martinez




I am in support of this project and I urge you to please pass this.




Tim Kelly




Wanted to ask the Commission for their support of this project.


I spoke in defense of the CEQA process and I am glad to see that it has been respected.


I think that it was only appropriate to be done and we have benefited.
 
 We will be learning much more about the social history of the building if you approve this project with the mitigation measures related to the public display regarding the history today.




Marc Glomb




We are looking forward to the possibility of our low-income seniors, which are primarily women that live on Social Security and SSI, having the possibility of homeownership in that building for themselves.




Philip Lesser




Nobody has spoken to the fact that this project is only 500 feet away from the 16
th
 and Mission BART station.
 
 This is an ideal place for high-density housing and retail.


I support this project.




              
 
John Crowly in place of
 
Sophia Ayala




People are displaced in the Mission because they are renters.
 
 They are not homeowners.


It is time to say yes to this project and move it forward.




Unclear name




Strongly supports this project because it would bring much needed housing improvements to the neighborhood.




Kenneth, translating from Chinese to English




The speaker urged the commission to push this project forward.
 
 The current building serves no purpose.




John Crowly, Local 483




We build them but we can’t live there


It is about time we built something where can we live.


This is a great project.




Luisa (unclear last name)




This particular project is a model--not only of working together and taking into consideration our working folks in San Francisco--but also for looking for ways to make it affordable for people to own their homes.




Nick Pagalatos




Would like to thank the community for continuing to engage in a tenacious way with the developers to make sure that community needs were met.


I am in support of this project. 
 
 And is not because it’s going to develop over 100 units of market rate housing, but rather because it is going to provide for dozens of units of below market rate housing at 80% of AMI, which is a precedent and which is a solid step in the right direction.




Ruby Harris




This is a significant opportunity for our buyers, but it does not go far enough.
 
 I want to echo a lot of things and let you know that our neighborhood is a low-income.


This is a good step in the right direction.


We look forward to working with future developers to really become more relevant to the neighborhood and to offer more opportunities for all these folks in the neighborhood.




Eric Quezada




There are a lot of people here today supporting the need for affordable housing in our neighborhood.
 
 That’s good.
 
 It would be good to see this kind of support every time we are here fighting for one more BMR unit.


The fight is not over.
 
 We have a long struggle ahead of us.


We support this project but we need to make sure to take care of the folks that have been there for many years, who have struggled through the difficult times in our neighborhood.
 
 The ones who have stuck it out.
 
 We need to make sure those folks aren’t victims of this project and that the businesses that have been serving our neighborhood aren’t forced out for lack of leases and speculation from other landlords in the neighborhoods who view this as an opportunity to displace more of our community.




Fernando Marti, Mission Anti Displacement Coalition




Over the last four years of working with this developer, we’ve gotten a project that will really be something that will, I think, be a first step and a precedent to how we might see development in the future in the Mission District.




Luis Granados




I think this is a step in the right direction.


To put it in context though, it would be great if this project were 100% affordable.




Bruce Alison




Spoke in opposition of this project.




Catania Galvan




We all need to see that projects like this become more the norm than the exception.




Rosario Anaya




 
 Believes that the builder has done much more than his due diligence


The neighborhood will be so much better served by the creation of new homes and spaces for small businesses in the community.


Urged the Commission to approve the project.




Joseph Shipman, Member of Local 22 carpenters Union




I find myself in a perplexing situation


I’m for affordable housing.
 
 Single parent dwellings are one of my big issues.


I just don’t see it.
 
 I see condos going up all over the place and I see myself as a hard working blue-collar worker and slowly being nudged out of my neighborhood.


I need the work and I don’t make that kind of money


I can’t afford to move into one of those units.




Danny Mclinden




If you build these, where will the poor in the Mission go?


Spoke in opposition of this project.




Bill Murphy




I’m disabled and live on a fixed income.


This project is only affordable to the wealthy


I know for a fact that at least 80% of the people in my part of the Mission make less than 30% of median income.


Many have big families to support with low-income jobs.


Most of the people in this neighborhood could never afford anything in this project unless it’s maybe a closet.


It will create more displacement and gentrification




Ellis McDonald




Does not support this project.




Marna Schwartz




80% AMI with 20% inclusionary should be the standard for development.


Teachers, Firemen, union workers and others should be able to buy these below market rate units


In order for folks with low incomes to get into these units, they are going to have to get down payment assistance form the City.




Larry Del Carlo




We have been renovating low and affordable housing in the Mission for 35 years.
 


We are committed to build low-income affordable housing in the Mission District and we will continue to do that


A project like this does not really bother us because it is an opportunity for many of our residents who have increased their income over the years, as they have been renters in our buildings, to be able to realize a dream that they have.
 
 To have an opportunity to get a start and own their first home.

 A low-income resident in one of our buildings does not stay a low-income resident forever.

375 Fremont Street
 
- 
Certification of a Final Environmental Impact Report.
 
 Subsequent to the publication of the Draft EIR, the project sponsor identified a new preferred alternative similar to Alternative B presented in the Draft EIR.
 
 The preferred project, called Alternative D, is a 250-foot-tall, 28-story residential building of approximately 349,071 gross square feet (gsf) consisting of 225 dwelling units and about 217 underground parking spaces. One existing two-story building on the site which totals approximately 46,500 gross square feet would be demolished. The 375 Fremont Street Hill Building, constructed in 1929, is a listed in four local surveys containing buildings that could be considered historic resources.
 
 The project site is located about mid-block on the eastern side of Fremont Street in the block bounded by Folsom, Fremont, Harrison, and Beale Streets.
 
 Vehicular access to the parking garage would be from Fremont Street on the northern side of the building.
 
 Pedestrian access would be from a lobby facing Fremont Street.
 
 The site is within the RC-4 (Residential/Commercial High-Density) district, and a 250-R height/bulk district. This site is within the newly adopted Rincon Hill Downtown Residential (DTR) District, which is awaiting final adoption by the Board of Supervisors. Should the Board of Supervisor adopt the propose Rincon Hill DTR, the proposed project would be in the new 85/400-R height and bulk district.


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
  Certify the Final Environmental Impact Report.
 
 Note: The public review period for the Draft Environmental Impact Report ended at 5:00 pm, January 6, 2005.
 
 The Planning Commission does not conduct public review of Final EIRs. Public comments on the certification may be presented to the Planning Commission during the Public Comment portion of the Commission calendar.

Request for Conditional Use
 
authorization
 to allow for the construction of a residential project that would include approximately 225 dwelling units, 217 non-independently off-street parking spaces, two off-street loading spaces, in a structure that would be 250-feet tall and 28-stories.
 
 Conditional Use is required pursuant to Planning Code Section 253 for the construction of a structure greater than 40-feet in a Residential District, and pursuant to Planning Code Section 249.1(b)(1)(B) for the construction of a project that would have full lot coverage on a sloping lot in the Rincon Hill Special Use District.
 
 The project is being considered under the Planning Code Section 249.1, the Rincon Hill Special Use District, rather than the recently adopted new zoning controls for the Rincon Hill area as outlined in Planning Code Sections 827 and 309.1.
 
 Planning Code Section 175.7 allows the subject lot to pursue entitlements under the zoning controls in effect prior to the adoption of the zoning amendments implementing the Rincon Hill DTR District.
 
 Under the previous controls, the subject lot was in an RC-4 (Residential Commercial Mixed High Density) District, the Rincon Hill Special Use District, and a 250-R Height and Bulk District.
 
 Under the new adopted zoning, the project site is within the Rincon Hill DTR (Downtown Residential District), and a 400-R Height and Bulk District.

 Gave an overall presentation of the project design and how that design responds to staff’s concerns.


Bob Meyers, Planning Consultant for Theodore Brown




Responded to the design changes suggested by staff.




Theodore Brown, Developer of the project.




Thanked staff for the four years of hard work on this project


Expressed that one of the most important things is to make this building livable.


We probably have the greatest amount of open space on the ground floor of any building in Rincon Hill.


Respectfully asked the Commission to approve this project as proposed.




Greg Miller




Asked the Commission to approve the project




Robert Herr, Attorney for the Project Sponsor




Reviewed the process history of this project and asked the Commission to approve the EIR certification and the conditional use request.




Tim O’Brien, West Coast Operating Partner for Five Field Companies and Theodore Brown’s Development Partner




We are currently developing over a billion and a half dollars of high-rise residential projects.
 
 Four in California


This is the first project in San Francisco


We are committed to high quality urban housing and are excited about bringing that much needed housing to San Francisco.


If this is a project you are prepared to approve tonight, we are prepared to build it.




Ernestine Weiss




I’m coming to you from a tenant’s point of view.


This is a perfect fit for the Rincon Area, as I’ve said before.


This is both an outstanding and exceptional design by Ted Brown, and it is both beautiful and practical.


I can’t find fault with one thing.




Pat McGarigan, A Lawyer representing the Archdiocese




The archdiocese is here tonight to be able to tell you that we believe it is feasible for them to reorient its building such that it has a rectangular shape along Harrison Street and that we believe will allow us to add approximately ten feet, maybe a little more setback from the 375 building, provided that we are able to work through with staff a few additional changes that would be required for such a project in terms of diagonal dimensions and the setback from the east side property line.


As well as a change in the floor plates.


All of those things are under consideration and will be involved in the process of our submittal as a revised CU application for the 385-399 project.


We don’t see that we can increase the tower separation more than the 60 to 80 foot range


We do think it is realistic for the 60 to 70 foot range


If we do this reorientation of the 385-399 project we do believe we can achieve a few additional units.


With these things, the adjourning property owner is supportive of this application.




 


              
 ACTION:
       
 Approved as modified:
 
 some corrections as pointed out by the project sponsor; setbacks in a couple different places – we took away the varying dimensions and said it would be 20 feet from the south side property line; strike the last condition; it will be subject to Rincon Hill requirements and fees; to continue working with staff to see if the balconies are movable; the Commission will get an informational presentation on colors, glazing and those types of items as the project goes forward.

SAN FRANCISCO MARINA RENOVATION PROJECT
 
- 
Draft Environmental Impact Report Public Hearing.
 
 
 
T
he proposed project is the renovation of the San Francisco Marina at 3950 Scott Street (Assessor’s Block 900, Lot 003). Water-side improvements would include installation of three new breakwater structures and the removal of two existing breakwater structures; reconstruction of portions of the degraded rip-rap slopes around the interior shorelines of the marina and along the outer seawall (between the St. Francis and Golden Gate Yacht Clubs); maintenance dredging; replacement and reconfiguration of the floating docks and slips; replacement of gangways and security gates; installation of an oily water and sewage pump-out facility and refurbishment of two sewage pump-out facilities; upgrade of electrical and water services to the new floating docks; and improved lighting on the docks.
 
 Land-side improvements would include renovation of marina restroom, shower, and office buildings; conversion of a vacant building (former Navy Degaussing Station) into office space; construction of a new 1,000-square-foot maintenance building; and restriping of existing parking lots. The project site is within a P (Public) Use District and an OS (Open Space) Height and Bulk District.


      
 
Preliminary Recommendation
:
 
 
No Action Required.
 
 Public hearing to receive
 
   
 
comments


      
 only.


Note:
 
 Written comments will be received at the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m. on October 20, 2005.


 


              
 SPEAKERS:


  
 
Joan Girardot




We are talking about 8 blocks of public shoreline open space that I believe is the most prized land use under the city’s General Plan.


We all want the harbor repaired, but in an environmentally sensitive way.


My first point is regarding the seismic retrofit of the existing seawalls.


The project would be funded by Long shore DPW, which has limited funds for the repair of the marina unit.


If you go to page 214 and the city says:
 
 they quote a report in 1997 that does not deny the seawalls need retrofit.
 
 But they don’t quote the earlier studies that say they will fall 4 to 8 feet.
 
 And it says they recommend that the city make repairs to the seawalls after an earthquake.


This is unacceptable.
          




Sue Chang




-I would like to speak out against the removal of the north south mall at the end.
 
 It is extremely well used.


Supports that the project be spanned to include the seismic retrofit of the seawall and requested that the Planning Commission require that the repair and replace alternative suggested by the Marina Improvement property evaluators be done for environmental review and the ability to meet the project sponsor’s objective.




Gloria Fontanello




The impact of this changes views, the foreseeable increase in traffic noise, congestion, the increased use of the pump out facility and increased intensity of use of the shoreline recreation area.


It must be evaluated in the final EIR.


The final EIR must also specify the exact location of this guest dock.


It should be obvious we need a traffic impact analysis to be included in the final report.




Jill Sinclair




The marina draft EIR before you today is in violation of code chapter 29.


I ask you today to suspend these proceedings and postpone this hearing until the violations have been addressed


I hope this area will not become a commercial space.




Don (unclear last name)




The Planning Commission should consider and recommend repairing and making replacements as needed to the existing harbor facilities with the existing layout and existing berth sizes.




Henry Coleman




Concerned about energy consumption.




Susan Lipson


-
 
 Concerned about the traffic circulation in the area.


Renee Monchard




This Environmental Impact Report is inadequate.




Nathaniel Berkowitz




Does not support the Environmental Impact Report




Judy Berkowitz


-
 
 Asked the Commission to accept two resolutions 1) is to recommend that the scope of the Marina Harbor project be expanded to include the seismic retrofit of the Marina Boulevard seawall and fire wall; 2) to recommend to the Recreation and Parks Department to retain all 228 small berths at the Marina.


David Cincotta
         




Asked the Commission if there were a possibility to have a future hearing and an extended comment period.
 
 That would be beneficial because some of these people, whom he represents, have considerable knowledge over the years and have read all of the background materials and studies.




Francisco DeCosta




This is a flawed Draft Environmental Impact Report because it does not address quality of life issues.




Marilyn Amini




Supports the request that the project scope include evaluation of seismic retrofit of the seawall to render the environmental impact report adequate and accurate.




 


ACTION:
       
 At the direction of the Chair, this item was continued to November 3, 2005 for a full public hearing.
 
 Staff has been instructed to invite the Recreation and Parks Department and the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board to review and comment at the hearing. 
 
 Also, the written comment period has been extended until 5:00 p.m. on November 10, 2005.

 Preliminary Recommendation: Pending


 


SPEAKERS:
 


Francisco DeCosta




Commissioners, be very careful not to set a precedent.


If we set a precedent where the public does not have meaningful dialogue…, that is not good for the City.




- Asked the Commission to be careful how they adjudicate this issue.


              
 
Shirley Jones, Chairperson of the Executive Park Advisory Committee




The committee supports the proposed housing development at Executive Park


The proposed development will result in a sizeable contribution to San Francisco schools and ultimate a sufficient increase in property tax.




  
 Linda Feliz




She passed out written statements by the Department of Children, Youth and Their Families, which she represents


Childcare is a vital infrastructure piece in meeting the needs of residents and employees in the case of Executive Park.


We are certain that the demand for childcare will not be decreased.




 


Fran Martin




Asked the Commission to ratify the fee ordinance for the good of the community.




              
 
Ann Seimann


- Supervisor Maxwell’s fee ordinance is a common sense and fair solution to the impacts that incoming developments will have on facilities and services.
                


  
 
Ron Seimann




He is a retired psychologist and a hearing impaired person.


He supports Supervisor Maxwell’s ordinance.


He very specifically wants to address the issue of the library.


I don’t think it is too much to ask that out of the huge amounts of money that the developers of Candlestick Cove will make from their project, they give back a little to our community, at least so we can have a library that will serve the community including the residents of “Candlestick Cove.”
 




              
 
Espanola Jackson




She is dissatisfied with how Bayview Hunters Point is not even being looked at.


We have an infrastructure [problem] there.


When everyone starts flushing their toilets, it comes to Bayview Hunters Point.


We had the Supervisor come out to the community day before yesterday


She could not explain to us why and how she decided on her own to put forth an ordinance without coming to the community and discuss it with the community.


She didn’t have an answer.


She said she could do what she wants to.


I have submitted a complaint to the Sunshine Ordinance Task Force because we’ve got to take care of business for Bayview Hunters Point


She is opposed to the ordinance.




Joe Boss




I really hope this helps clarify the need for coming up with a system that starts from the beginning with public input, goes through assessing the existing needs such as libraries,, and identifying new impact needs; coming up with real nexus studies that indicate what impacts there are and what the development should pay for .


Opposes the ordinance.




ACTION:
       
 Approved as amended to require continued dialogue between the Supervisor, developer, impacted communities; monies should be divided among Little Hollywood, Bayview Hunters Point & Visitacion Valley.
