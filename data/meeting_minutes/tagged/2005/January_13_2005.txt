SOUTH OF MARKET REDEVELOPMENT PLAN
 
- 
Certification of the Final Supplement to the FEIR for the South of Market Redevelopment Plan Amendment -
 The South of Market Redevelopment Plan Amendment (“Redevelopment Plan Amendment”) proposes to convert the South of Market Earthquake Recovery Redevelopment Project Area to a redevelopment project area (“Project Area”) and will authorize the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency (“Agency”) to use tax-increment financing to alleviate physical and economic conditions of blight and to use eminent domain to alleviate these blighting conditions.
 
 The proposed amended Project Area is generally bounded by Stevenson, Mission and Natoma Streets on the north, Fifth Street on the east, Harrison and Folsom Streets on the south and Seventh Street on the west.
 
 In order to finance projects and programs that would alleviate the conditions of blight, the Redevelopment Plan Amendment would also include:


                                   
  ·
         
 An amended expiration date, which extends the redevelopment plan by 10 years (from June 11, 2010 to June 11, 2020);


                                               
  ·
         
 Extended deadlines for the Agency to incur and repay indebtedness secured by tax increment funds; and


                             
  ·
         
 Increase the aggregate amount of tax increment the Agency may receive (from $102,000,000 to $200,000,000) and the maximum amount of bonded indebtedness the Agency may have outstanding at any one time (from $60,000,000 to $80,000,000).


 


The Agency proposes to carry out a comprehensive program to alleviate the adverse effect of blight in the Project Area. by implementing the five main elements of the Amendment’s program:1) Improve residential conditions and encourage residential activity;2) Improve economic conditions and encourage business activity;3) Promote area quality of life and social services;4) Address infrastructure and transportation needs;and 5) Assure appropriate neighborhood land uses and design.
  
  Implementation of the Redevelopment Plan Amendment is expected to yield a total of 834 residential units (483 small residential units and 351 family units), 114,618 square feet of commercial development and 91,375 square feet of industrial development at buildout in 2020.
 
 The implementation of the Redevelopment Plan Amendment is also expected to result in rehabilitation of 300 existing single room occupancy residential hotel units that are either vacant or have substandard living conditions.
