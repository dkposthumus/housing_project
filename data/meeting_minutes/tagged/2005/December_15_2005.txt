- Lot 012 of Assessor’s Block 1262, bounded by Stanyan, Beulah and Shrader Streets - 
Appeal of Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration
 for the proposed demolition of a single-family residence and construction of a three-unit residence.
 
 
The existing building is a 1,755-gross-square-foot (gsf) one-story-over-garage, single-family home, constructed in approximately 1897.
 
 The proposed project would result in the construction of a 5,550-gsf, four-story, three-unit residential building.
 
 The approximately 1,240-gsf ground floor would be used as a garage for the proposed three off-street parking spaces.
 
 The remaining three floors would each contain one two-bedroom dwelling unit.
 
 The proposed project would rise 40 feet from street level to the top of the parapet.
 
 The site is zoned RH-3 (House, Three-Family) and is in a 40-X height and bulk district.
 


Preliminary Recommendation: Uphold Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration

Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals




 


BoA:
 
 {This was heard following Category D – General Public Comment 15 Minutes}




At the request of President Lee, the Zoning Administrator responded to Mr. Joe O’Donohue’s statement about a permit issue of Director Amy Lee of the Department of Building Inspection.


There was a claim that Ms. Lee did not follow the permitting process and that she received preferential treatment.
 
 The Board upheld the permit 5 to 0.
 
 William Shock, who is now an official in Alameda, represented the Department of Building Inspection, under direction from the City Attorney’s Office.
 
 He is also the head of the California Association of Building Officials.
 
 He is a well recognized person in the building field.
 
 He reviewed the findings and various permits.
 
 He believed that the permits appeared correct.
 
 The claims against Ms. Lee were soundly rejected.


There were questions about the Planning Department’s role and my role specifically.
 
 Ms Lee received an Administrative variance and there was a question about that within the Planning Code and how was it allowed to be granted without a public hearing.
 
 I had not done those up until the last two years, but given our backlog, I have started to implement those, though I do provide public notice on them.
 
 If anyone has concern, they can bring it to my attention.
 
 Ms. Lee is one of six DRs, Administrative Variance that has been granted.


The other claim was that her permit for a dormer was processed overly fast.
 
 It cleared the city in a week.
 
 Normally those would be over the counter permits.
 
 However, this was in the rear yard area and we had to ascertain that it was covered by the variance that was previously granted.
 
 So we did not think granting it in a week was anything extraordinary.
 
 In fact, it could have normally been done over the counter.


At the request of Commissioner Hughes, the Zoning Administrator responded to Mr. Williams’ assertion that DR applicants and/or their representatives are not being notified as to a date that may be selected by staff for a hearing.


The Department’s policy is that for the initial date of a Commission hearing, staff is supposed to work with both the project sponsor and the requester for DR and set a date that is agreed to.
 
 After that, preference is usually given to the project sponsor if it is a code complying building/project.

 GENERAL
 
PUBLIC COMMENT – 15 MINUTES


 


At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.
 
 With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting.
 
 Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.


  


SPEAKERS:


Joe O’Donohue




Once again, a Building Commission hearing scheduled for next month has been cancelled.
 
 That means that in four months, we would only have had two commission hearings effectively as a Planning Commission.


What we’ve had here is an interference with the flow of information and a suppression of critiquing and criticism of what’s happening at the Bureau of Building Inspection, and that is flowing to this Department.


Last night there was a hearing regarding the Director of the Building Commission on her permit.


There is a rule in the Building Code that says if you have an unoccupied floor, if you occupy it, it becomes part of the vertical of horizontal addition.
 
 That is the rule.


In 1995 the Building Code was changed with a code that said unoccupied floors that transform into a four-story building have to be fully sprinkled.


Last night evidence was given by a Building Commissioner that he visited a [the] site.


There was no habitable room down there.


Despite that evidence, this lady was only required in what is a double standard to sprinkle just the basement, not seismic the entire building.


What we have here is a major cover up that involved, in fact, a public official calling some of the Commissioners or some public officials about how they could influence the vote.




Patricia Vaughey




Spoke on the Cow Hollow Design Guidelines


The purpose of these guidelines was to stop these Discretionary Reviews and to have an over all plan on how we protect the public vista of Cow Hollow as well as have the continuity of the neighborhood.




Charles Mar Stellar




Commended the Commission on their thoughtful and assertive way of commenting to the Board on the Better Neighborhoods proposal.
 
 The Board has continued it until January 17, 2006.


Many of the members didn’t understand the origin and genesis of this bill and had not heard the details regarding your proposal for a pilot.


The Board needs to hear directly from its Planning Commissioners by visit and by telephone


I would recommend you prepare an estimated budget for your pilot program to present to the Board.


Commissioners, it is imperative for you to directly assert yourselves at this critical time so we can achieve best outcomes for this important policy matter.


Planning by ballot initiative is certainly not a good outcome.




Steve Williams




Wanted to speak on one issue mentioned by President Lee, and that is managing your calendar and your agenda.


You may not know it, but the Discretionary Review applicants, the neighbors, the appellant, are actually given no rights in the scheduling process.


In fact they’re not even contacted in the scheduling process.


We pay a fee, we file the appeal, we file the DR and that’s really the end of any sort of control that we have.


I suggest to the Commission that you ask staff to at least make a phone call to the appellant, to the person whose appeal is going to be heard.


That would save a lot of trouble and save a lot of unnecessary appearances and movement of the calendar.




 


E.
        
 CONSENT CALENDAR


 


All matters listed hereunder constitute a Consent Calendar, are considered to be routine by the Planning Commission, and will be acted upon by a single roll call vote of the Commission.
 
 There will be no separate discussion of these items unless a member of the Commission, the public, or staff so requests, in which event the matter shall be removed from the Consent Calendar and considered as a separate item at this or a future hearing.

 The proposed Special Use District would permit, with conditional use authorization, an affordable housing project with up to 18 dwelling units, at a building height of 50 feet, with modifications from off-street parking and rear yard requirements, within the NC-3 (Moderate-Scale Neighborhood Commercial) Land Use District and the 40-X Height and Bulk District, proposed for zoning reclassification below.


                       
 Preliminary recommendation:
 
 Approval.


 


SPEAKER(S):
              


Sharene (unclear last name), Project Sponsor




I just want to come before you today to represent the position of the project as it has now taking a new form.


About 18 months ago we came before you and received planning approval for what we then perceived to have been a tax credit project.
 
 The project did not meet the minimum standards that we felt to be competitive of a tax credit project and therefore we re-looked at the project and determined, with the support of the community, that a for-sale housing development would be welcome and beneficial on that site.


We at that time were able to increase the unit count from 15 to 18 when we removed the tax credit standards off the project.


We are also able now to petition the State of California for additional funding under the Begin Program.




Rick Williams




We have been before the PAC with modifications to the project to make sure that they have a clear understanding and clear support of the project.


The key component in changing the unit mix or the unit count from 15 to 18 units was the tax credit requirements were substantial for the proportion of three bedroom units.
 
 With this project we have a similar square footage but we modified the program to be a mix of one and two-bedroom units rather than having more three bedroom units.


The diagram shows the provision for strong street frontage with strong retail space along the street and the corner.


There’s also a community display case, which the community had requested as part of the street frontage.




 


ACTION:
    
  Approved as amended:


-
 
 On page 2, Line 3, Lines 2 and 3 where it describes the project as having ground floor retail space and 2000 square feet and ten off-street parking spaces, it should read: retail space of 2250 square feet and 11 off-street parking spaces.




On line 10 it refers to amending Section 249.27 which should be Section 249.30.




- On page 4 the approvals required, line number 6 states that a rear yard variance pursuant to section 134 of the planning code would be required. It should say a modification or exception to the rear year requirements of section 134 of the planning code.

PUBLIC COMMENT


At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.
 
 With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.
 
 When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.
 
 Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.


The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.
 
 In response to public comment, the commission is limited to:


(1) Responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or


(2) Requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or


(3) Directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.
 
 (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))


 


Joe O’Donoghue


- I find it ironic that throughout the ‘90s when the Residential Builders through Sue Hester was fighting protest after protest, brief after brief on behalf of an undisclosed client that delayed and cost projects thousands of dollars that never once did any bureaucrat in the Planning Department raise the issue of who the undisclosed client was.


- However, now that the Andrews Act is filed on behalf of an undisclosed client, suddenly it has become an issue.


- That is fine.


- I disagree with everything Andrew Zaches does, but I respect his right to do it.


- But we are not going to be precluded from the cover up that is happening at the Building Department.


- There was no investigation done on this property.


- Every complaint that has been done to the Bureau of Building Inspection in the past warrants an investigation when asked for.


- None has been granted.


- Everyone has freedom of speech and people have the right to protest.


- Again there is an attempt to deflect from the issue


- And it is a cover up.


- Actually the Zoning Director should not testify like the Building Department officials who are precluded from testifying.
 
 They should have brought in an outsider to testify because of the relationship.


- This of course doesn’t end here.
