 Commission Comments/Questions


 


Commissioner Antonini:


Re: Article in the today’s Examiner, 
Unaffordable Housing
, written by Joe Cobb, used to be Chief Economist for the US Senate.
 
 Basically his thesis is ‘The higher the percentage of inclusionary housing that is required by a locality, the lower the amount of housing that is produced overall.’
 
 He points out that over the last 30 years that this has been in force we’ve only produced about 228 units statewide that classify as inclusionary.
 
 He uses the case of Watsonville that had an inclusionary requirement of 25% for nine years and virtually nothing was built by the market.
 
 Since it was lowered in 2000 they have increased their housing stock by 12%.
 
 This might not be overwhelming, but it is something we should look at--how much a deterrent a particular policy is at the higher levels from the production of housing and how much does it add to the sale prices of those units that are market rate?
 
 Would like to hear from any staff or anyone who has additional statistics on this issue and what has been the track record of this type policy in the last 20 years in California.


 


 


 


Commissioner W. Lee:


Re: Next month’s presentation by the Director of the Mayor’s Office of Housing, regarding housing issues and affordable housing -- he would like to extend the invitation to the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), and get their input on what other counties are doing regarding housing and affordable housing issues?

Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals




           
 BOS:




Supervisor Maxwell has introduced a fee ordinance that proposes to be imposed on projects approved in Executive Park and Visitacion Valley.
 
 This ordinance will come to the Planning Commission.
 
 Associated with that, it was the supervisors’ judgment that she should defer action on the General Plan amendment, which in fact was the item before the Board of Supervisors at the time.
 
 The decision you made on General Plan amendments is for the Board to either approve or disapproved.
  
 Supervisor Maxwell chooses to disapprove on the bases that she did not want any project to go forward pending the disposition of this proposed ordinance.


Will attend a meeting in Visitacion Valley with the Board of Supervisors to give a status report regarding site plans and potential impacts on Executive Park.
 
 I will also bring that committee up to date on the status of Leland Avenue.
 
 This is one of the projects that we have under the Better Streets Project.


On October 6, 2005, you will have a presentation on Green Buildings.


On October 20, 2005, you will have a discussion regarding Affordable Housing.


On October 27, 2005, you will have an enforcement presentation so you can be brought up to date on the enforcement program.


The Board has presented a zoning map amendment for Roosevelt Way and Henry Street to zone that parcel as open space.




 


BOA:




4967-69 17
th
 Street - dwelling unit merger.
 
 The Commission expressed concerned about this merger even though the tenants had left.
 
 The Board originally heard this on 8/17/05 and closed the hearing to allow Commissioner Allbright to hear the findings.
 
 They voted to overturned the Planning Commission’s denial, and approve the merger +5 to -0, they sited that the original configuration of the building was a single family dwelling and also noted that while there was a Certificate of Final Completion, it said that this was a two-unit building.
 
 We were not able to locate a building permit that allowed it to go from a single to two-family building.


455 Pennsylvania Street – heard in February. The Planning Commission took discretionary review and removed the fourth floor, set the third floor back by 15 feet, recessed the garage door and remove the proposed parapet. Project sponsor did not agree with the changes and asked that the permit be disapproved.
 
 The Board upheld the Planning Commission’s determination.
 
 They also felt it would be appropriate for the project sponsor to take advantage of the rear yard pop-up that is permitted under the code.


763 University Street - Planning Commission took discretionary review.
 
 Your decision was appealed – The Board upheld the Planning Commission +4 to -0 and required the Planning Department to further review for conformance to Residential Design Guidelines.

 Regarding information on legislations:
 
 you will find this week a summary of the Medical Cannabis Dispensaries legislation.
 
 We are going to continue to provide you with this kind of summary as we get the legislations.
 
 It will be a very brief outline of just the facts contained within without creating any policy issues.

If this Nexus study proves to be faulty and it is not accurate, there is no equation between affordable housing and new development being created.
 
 The City needs to step up to the plate and put a stop to this kind of extortion.




Jim Miko




The slush fund is a development fee already agreed to by developers of all the projects affected in the Rincon Hill area.


The fees would be allocated based on the recommendations of the Citizens Advisory Committee appointed by the Board of Supervisors.

David Silverman, representing project sponsor




This project strikes the right balance between housing density and existing neighborhood character.


The new building will replace a dilapidated warehouse and will enhance the neighborhood by bringing family friendly dwellings to an area slated for more housing developments by both the General Plan and the Eastern Neighborhood Zoning policies.


This is a beautifully designed building that complies with the Planning Code and deserves the Planning Commission support.




Eric Quezada, MAC




Over the last couple months, MAC has been working with a group of neighbors on Natoma and Minna Streets basically looking with a compromise.


We are all familiar with MAC concerns about the loss of PDR.


We are not in agreement with everything that is in the plan, but we feel that this is a compromise that with came with neighbors input.


We would like to present to you an alternative vision of a better project--one that meets the broader and longer-term goals.


It is not a question that this particular design meets all the codes.


What we want to provide is a framework that met the goals of the neighbors.


We hope that in your wisdom, you look to all the alternatives that are out there, and understand that we work with many different interests.




Ciaran Scallan




Opposed to project.


This huge monolith of a building of 50 feet or so is not going to do anything for our neighborhood.
 
 It is out of character.




Ted Whipple




Feel that the Conditional Use application should be denied.


Project is simply too big for this alley.
 
 It is out of character.


It is un-affordable to most of the neighbors.




Luke Longin




Concerned about parking.




Marna Schwartz, MEDA




Concerned about the need for affordable housing in that area.


Many of the neighbors are unable to purchase in the area and are being displaced.


If you continue to erect buildings such as the proposed development that are going to be luxury styled, there will be further displacement in the community.




Tracy Parent, MEDA




Talking about family friendly dwellings -- we feel there is a big disconnect between the proposed plan, and what family friendly means for the neighbors.


The families that live in this neighborhood cannot afford this kind of luxury condominium units.


70% of household in the Mission earn less than $90,000 dollars a year.


Who are these units for?


Asked the Commission to support the alternative plan.




Maire Sheahan




Opposed to Project.




Hsing-Yen Fu




Concerned about privacy.




Robert Hernandez




Strongly objects and protests the 50-foot height that is proposed to be built.




Fernando Marti, MAC




We need our modest market rate units for the families in the Mission District so they can stay with their community and not have to leave the neighborhood.




Mariana Viburro




This project proposes to build ten luxury condominiums, which are not accessible to any family that currently lives in the vicinity.




Patricia Moore




This project will be helpful for the neighborhood to grow, and will also help to solve some of the many problems we have with gangs.




Joe O’Donoghue




There is no impact on tenants.


We live in a rent controlled City.


This project is being built on a lot where there are not tenants.




Dan McCarthy




In favor of project.




Shawn Kikran




In favor of project.




James Nunamacher




In favor of project




Antonio Perez




Supports building because it will bring pride and ownership to the neighborhood.

Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit Application No. 2005.01.21.3730, proposing to convert the existing single-family dwelling at 600 Kansas Street into a two-family dwelling following the subdivision of an existing lot into two lots, with off-street parking provided on the newly created adjacent lot, subject to granting of a parking variance by the Zoning Administrator; in an RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) Use District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary review and approve the building permit as it has 
    
 been submitted.


           


SPEAKERS:


Jeremy Paul, representing first Discretionary Review Requestor




There are some serious design issues with this project.


The orientation of this building with the rear yard facing the main living portion of the Edelson’s home is a very in-appropriate decision.


He could decide to turn these buildings toward Kansas Street or 18
th
 Street.


The decision to face toward 18
th
 Street backed-up the main living area of that house directly to the Edelson’s home in a way that is completely unnecessary for a quality project.


The addition to the existing building unreasonably increases the housing density adjacent to 606 Kansas.


The height and bulk are way out the norm for this neighborhood.


It is a very poor design of this building.




John Carney




Strongly objects to the staff recommendations.


Concerned about the parking.




Mary Louise Green




This new building should be facing Kansas Street, and it should be a flat not a duplex.




Babette Drefke




Concerned about parking.


Parking on Potrero Hill is at a premium right now.




Dick Millett




Concerned about parking.


Also concerned about the fire escapes.




Anne Symoa




The proposed project would create little parking spaces, cutting up the open space.


This building already violates the intention of the general plan by having a front yard instead of a backyard.




Nic Vereczlky




This building would be out of character.


It will really reduce the existing front lot size, and would take the entire corner.


The original plans done and turned into the City, were reviewed properly.




Veva Edelson




Presented to the Commission a petition of about 160 signatures opposing this project.




Jennifer Durrant




Her concern is that the developer at the corner of 18
th
 and Kansas Streets wishes to create a 160 x 50 foot lot and two 20 x 50 foot lots.
 
 This will be 40% of the size of a normal Potrero Hill lot.


One Potrero Hill lot should not be split into three.




Robin Myers




Read a letter from David Colleen, Architect for the State of California, and resident of the Potrero Hill opposing the project.




Athena Poppas




This project would have an unusual impact on privacy to neighboring interior living space.




Robert Fender




Concerned about the height, loss of light, and view.


The new proposed structure would block the northern view of the downtown skyline.




Dan Miller, Project Sponsor




Gave a general overview of the project, and respectfully requested that the Commission approve his application.




Joel Yodowitz, representing the Project Sponsor




Project Sponsor did, what a responsible Project Sponsor should do...


He met several times with neighbors and Planning Department staff.




Henry Quan, Architect




Generally described the project.




Scott Cross




In favor of project.

BETTER NEIGHBORHOODS PLUS TEXT AMENDMENTS
 
 
 -
 
Consideration of an Ordinance [Board of Supervisors File Number 050601] which would establish a “Better Neighborhoods Planning and Implementation Process”
 by (a) adding Chapter 36 to the Administrative Code in order to set forth uniform procedures for developing comprehensive neighborhood plans, (b) amending Administrative Code Section 3.4 to provide for integrated budget documents, and (c) adding Section 312A to the Planning Code regarding discretionary review for projects located within plan areas.


Preliminary Recommendation: Commission Holds Public Hearing


(Continued from Regular Meeting of July 14, 2005)


NOTE
:
 
 On August 4, 2005, following public testimony, the commission president directed that this iteM be calendared for discussion at all commission hearings through september 15, 2005—with possible action on september 15, 2005.


 


SPEAKERS:
    


Mary Helen Baiscor




Better Neighborhood Plus Plan will limit our input on various projects


Better Neighborhood Plus will weaken the Planning Code and is likely to be destructive to neighborhoods.


There is no guarantee that this will reflect the neighborhood’s needs or characters. But there is every chance that it will be an imposition by others.
 
 That is not in our best interest.


Why are you in such hurry to make such significant changes?
 
 These changes that might be potentially destructive.


Urged the Commission to take more time to consider and amend this plan or amend the Planning Code itself.




Ron Miguel




One of his concerns is the appropriateness of applying the legislation [to] an area of 40 acres or more.
 
 40 acres is too small.




Joe Boss




Expressed his concerns about the need analysis and impact analysis, not being the financial responsibility of the development project.




 
 
Tim Colen




Supports the efforts of the remarkable working group who came together to draft this legislation.


San Francisco needs to grow and change and the key to do this essentially is with the type of planning contemplated in this legislation.




Alice Barkley




Requested that Rincon Hill be exempted from this legislation.




Jim Meko




Spoke in favor of the legislation.




Dave Bisho




Asked Commission for a time extension of 45 days before a decision is made.




Hiroshi Fukuda




Opposes the legislation




Kenneth Kruszka




Read a letter from Mary Burns, President, Greater West Portal Neighborhood Association, requesting the Commission to grant an extension.




John Bardis




It is really pretty remarkable.
 
 You’ll be asked by some group that was not planning staff, to participate in a non-public process to accept legislation that was part of a backroom session and then introduce it to the Board of Supervisors.




Jeffrey Leibowitz




What legislation are we discussing here?


What legislation is going to be forward to the Board of Supervisors?


Concerned about whether or not the studies, particularly for the Eastern SOMA--the improvement and funding studies that were called out in the legislation, are being conducted now by the Planning Department.




 


 


Judith Berkowitz




Any change by the City to Land Use Controls, the Planning Code, and the planning implementation process should be accomplished by amending the Planning Code not the Administrative Code.
 
 A process that fundamentally defines planning should be in the Planning Code, not in the Administrative Code.


Requested that this legislation be sent back to the Board of Supervisors with the recommendations to be placed in the Planning Code.




Marilyn Amini




There is a lot to address regarding this legislation.
 
 There was no public notification or process.
 
 Land use controls should be part of the Planning Code instead of the Administrative Code.




Bernard (unclear last name)




We would like far more discussion.
 
 There should be further delays by the Board of Supervisors, and your recommendations to the Board.




Emery Coleman




Opposed to the legislation.


More studies should be done.


Does not trust the Planning Department.
