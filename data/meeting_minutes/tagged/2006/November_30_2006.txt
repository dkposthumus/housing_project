COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
 
 
 
(Tape IA)


 




Commission Comments/Questions




 


Commissioner Antonini:


-I would like a session to discuss the parameters of conditional use versus as-of-right.
 
 What guidelines are there?


-It would be valuable in the future to have a broad idea on what parts of the city requires notices in order for us to answer questions from the public on cases like the shelter on Clementina Street.


-I would like to thank some individuals who gave me a tour at the Bayview Hunters' Point.


-I agree with what has been said that this might be the area of the city that is most challenging and also has the most potential.


-It is one of the fewest areas that combine industrial, housing, sports, recreational and retail spaces.
 
 There is enough space for all these uses.


-A question was raised about big-box developments for religious institutions and if it is contain in the redevelopment.


-On that same line, I was able to stop at a point and overview the Shipyard.


-The area is partly still developing and certainly needs some cleaning.


-In terms of the 49ers questions, in the interest of the public, we should address this concern with all interested parties to move in a direction to benefits everybody in the city.


-It would allow keeping the team in the city and also use some of this benefit to help the challenges that exist in that area.


Commissioner Sugaya
:


-I would like to have information about an article in the newspaper about an alternative plan development released for the Bayview Shipyard -- a 137-page book.
 
 It would be good to have an informational item on that.


-A Performance Measure Report mentioned that a plan for Japan Town was being initiated.
 
 I would like some information at a future meeting.


-At another of our meetings, Visitacion Valley was being discussed.


-It was mentioned that there might be a joint meeting with the Brisbane Planning Commission to present their plan for the immediate area to the South or at least if the Director could come to give us information about it.


-The planning is moving forward and I know they have identified some project, preservation and development alternatives.


-I received a flyer in the mail for the ABAG Symposium 2007.
 
 I would not be able to attend and if staff could attend and give us a summary.


Commissioner Olague
:


-I am interested in having an overview of the Residential Design Guidelines and I would be interested to invite Allen Jacobs since he was one of the directors.


-Given that we are looking a lot at neighborhood plans, it would give us an idea of what the initial intention was when these guidelines took place.


Mr. Badiner, Zoning Administrator


-I just want to make clear that there is no notices requirement for the change of use for the West SOMA area and that is the reason why I suggested the block book notation for the homeless shelter on Clementina Street.


-At that time, the public could request discretionary review to bring it to the Planning Commission.


-The City passed an ordinance about big-box in the Bayview Hunter's Point.
 
 Over 50,000 square feet is a CU [Conditional Use] and over 90,000 square feet is prohibited


-Dean Macris, Planning Director, was in charge of the Residential Design Guidelines and will be invited to present it.


Amit Ghosh, Chief Planner


-We will research getting the information requested.


-The joint meeting with DBI has not been set up yet.


-We will work with the Secretary to schedule presentations.


 




- The Planning Commission will discuss and take possible action on the search for a new Director of Planning, including setting criteria and salary for the Director of Planning, and establishing procedural guidelines for the search and selection of a new Director of Planning.
 
 The Commission may take action to:
 
 adopt or endorse the criteria for the Director of Planning, establish the salary range for the Director of Planning, outline the process for selection of a new Director of Planning, and/or authorize the President of the Commission to execute a contract or contract modification with the existing consultant to continue to conduct and assist in
 
the search for candidates for
 
the position of Director of Planning.




 


SPEAKERS


Lois Scott
, Planning Staff


-For the new director search, you should examine organizational strengths and weaknesses.


-They should prove to be a good role model.
 
 Updating the job description would help in a meaningful process.


-Department staff would like to participate in the candidate search.


Bernard Choden


-New director should be aware of the City's Mission.


-To have an advisor role and knowledge of federal government requirement.
