west side between Geary and Post Streets, Lot 2, in Assessor's Block 310 - 
Request for: 1) a Determination of Compliance
 under Section 309 of the Planning Code to permit conversion of an existing office building to approximately 7 residential dwelling units, with an exception to the Planning Code rear yard requirement; 2) 
a Conditional Use authorization
 to exceed the principally permitted dwelling unit density for the subject site; and 3) 
for the granting by the Zoning Administrator of residential open space and parking variances
; for the subject property, which is in the C-3-O Zoning District and a 80-130-F Height and Bulk District.
 
 The Zoning Administrator will hear the variance application concurrently with the Planning Commission. The proposal is to convert the existing office use on the top seven floors of the subject building to approximately 7 dwelling units (one per floor at approximately 1,200 square feet, retaining existing ground floor retail use.
 
 Some common residential open space would be created on the rooftop of the subject building, but less would be provided than the minimum required by the Planning Code due to roof size and fire code restrictions.
 
 No parking would be provided in order to preserve the building's historic faÃ§ade, to avoid creating automobile/pedestrian conflicts, and also due to the subject lot's narrow widt
h of 20 feet.

 This project is within an NC-3 District and an 80-A Height and Bulk District.

 Director's Announcements


 


Dean Macris – Planning Director




I thought we'd start today by reminding you what our schedules are now for the Eastern Neighborhoods.


We plan a set of workshops in the various neighborhoods that comprise the Eastern Neighborhoods.


I would like to ask Jasper Rubin of our staff to go over that with you --the permanent control program that we are following for the Eastern Neighborhoods.


To repeat one more time, we plan next week to introduce interim controls, which we hope that you will initiate.


I would remind the Commissioners and the public that this is not in your calendar today.
 
 It is a non-agenda subject so you may not discuss this today.
 
 You can wait until next week for your questions and explanations.




 


Jasper Rubin, Department staff




Gave a brief outline on the proposal for public outreach of the Eastern Neighborhood planning effort.


The EIR is underway and we are starting workshops as part of our effort.




 




Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals




 


Board of Supervisors – reported by Dan Sider of Department staff




This Tuesday was the first meeting of the Board of Supervisors in 2006.


There are a number of items that I'd like to cover, and will be a succinct as possible


Five decisions made by the Board that we feel might be relevant to this body.


First of all, a moratorium on Pay Day Lenders and check Cashing Establishments has been adopted by the Board.


A 45 days moratorium on any new such establishments.
 
 This will become effective upon the Mayor's signature or ten days after the Board adoption Tuesday, whichever comes first.


We look forward to developing criteria with which to implement this and we will report to you as it becomes more concrete.


Second item which you did review, Supervisor Daly's proposal to require Planning Commission hearings of all condominium conversions subject to the condo lottery.
 
 This was amended and passed on first reading by the Board 6 to 3, Supervisors Dufty, Elsbernd and Ma voted against.


901 Bush – tentative, an important project nonetheless, a 38 condominium project.


723 27
th
 Avenue – a two family dwelling in the Richmond District. This is a project that would have appeared before you in the future. Discretionary Review prior to a ____ before this body.
 
 An appeal of the Categorical Exemption was filed.


The Board did review this on Tuesday an it did not uphold the Planning Department's determination that this project was categorically exempt.
 
 As such as initial study will be performed or the project will be modified. So, this is something you may see in the future, but under a different set of circumstances.


C-3 Parking, Supervisor Daly's proposal to reduce parking requirements in this area, an appeal of all environmental determinations was filed on this project. The Board 9 to 1 upheld the Department's determination that the project was exempted from environmental review.
 
 This piece of legislation will now go ahead in the legislative process and head towards further review by the City.


I'd like to comment on three pieces of legislation the were introduced on Tuesday.The legislation introduced has not been finalized yet, so I have to be brief, but we are aware of three ordinances that would relate to this body.


First, a triling piece of legislation to the Medical Cannabis Dispensary ordinance which was passed last year.
 
 This would deal primarily with existing dispensaries and would relax some of the location ____ for dispensaries which wish to relocate.
 
 We will report back to you on details.


Also introduced by Supervisor Daly, an amendment to the subject code dealing with condominiums.
 
 This is in item of interest to this Commission.


Lastly, introduction by Supervisor Alioto-Pier regarding C-3 Parking and we can speculate at this point as to what that may or may not say, but we will report back to you next week once the formal text is introduced.


901 Bush Street is an existing building that was burnt out in 1999.
 
 It was a rental building with about 38 dwelling units.
 
 It was purchased and rehabilitated. This building was essentially gutted and the project came to us primarily as a condominium conversion. Now, the Department of Public Works – Bureau of Maps and Service, made some _____ there can be existing buildings that are heavily damaged and they would consider it new construction.

Consideration of an ordinance initiated by Supervisor Jake McGoldrick on October 11, 2005 which would amend Planning Code Sections 315.2 and 315.3 to expand application of the Inclusionary Affordable Housing Program
 
from proposed residential projects of 10 or more units to proposed residential projects of five or more units and making environmental findings and findings of consistency with the priority policies of Planning Code Section 101.1 and the General Plan.
 
 The City Planning Commission held an informational hearing on this matter on December 8, 2005.


Preliminary Staff Recommendation: After public testimony, staff will present its recommendation to the Commission.


 


 
 
SPEAKERS:
 


 
 
Rosario Ramirez




My concern is a lot of the families here in San Francisco are actually living in very small units.


Asked Commission for their support, because there are thousands of families living here in the Tenderloin and don't have nice units to live.




Sally Magnussen




I am here before you as a parent, as a person who found it very difficult to live in San Francis because of the increasingly expensive rent.


Practically everybody I know leaves the City because it's not family friendly at all.




Ruby Harris, Mission Anti Displacement Coalition




I am here today to recommend that you recommend d adoption of this amendment and move it forward to the Board of Supervisors.


As you know, the Mission District has been under severe development pressure for the last many years.


This has had direct effect on the quality of life for our low-income residents and businesses alike.




Nick (unclear last name), Mission Anti Displacement Coalition




Supports the McGoldrick amendment.


Also requested that there be no study conducted on this.


There has been an ongoing planning process in the Eastern Neighborhoods now for the past five years.


We have enough information to know what's needed out there. To say that at this late stage of the game we need another study is outrageous.




Tracy Parent




Strongly support this amendement.




Bruce Allison




In favor of this amendement.




Jose Morales




In favor of this amendement.




Jessie Araguen




In favor of this amendement.




Brett Gladstone




Against the amendment.




Lu Blazej




It is again a question of how you do the percentages and whether you make your affordable housing requirement a function of the percentage of the number of units of a project.


Supervisor McGoldrick recognized the problem with if you have a five unit project, let's use 10% as an example to make the math easy. You are required half of unit. You can't build half of unit. If you build14 units, 10% of 14 is 1.4.
 
 You round won, you build one unit, so in essence, the math turns out if you make someone round up with a five unit project, they are doing 20% affordable, while a 14 unit project is doing 7% affordable.
 
 There is an inequity there.


Section 315.4A2 which has the requirement in the code, basically right now reads that 12% of the units hsall be affordable to qualifying households


If you strike the work units and substitute it with a phrase that 12% of the gross floor area of the residential project shall be affordable to qualifying households, you simplified this process incredibly, and you also have made it very equitable for everyone involve.




Robert McCarthy




First, commended the staff for recommending that we actually have facts before you before you make a decision.


It is not because anybody here debates the fact that those who are working class and below are having difficulty finding housing in San Francisco.


The question is are there unintended consequences from this and the next legislation that might in fact have a negative impact on the generation of affordable housing?


The significant amount of affordable housing that is generated in this City is generated out of by inclusionary housing or it's generated by in-lieu fees.

Consideration of an ordinance initiated by Supervisor Chris Daly on November 22, 2005 which would amend Planning Code Sections 315.1, 315.2, 315.4 and 315.5 to increase inclusionary affordable housing
 
requirements for all proposed residential developments of 10 units or more; adjust the income calculation methods to reflect City and County of San Francisco median income calculations; and make environmental findings and findings of consistency with the priority policies of Planning Code Section 101.1 and the General Plan.
 
 The City Planning Commission held an informational hearing on this matter on December 8, 2005. Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Pending.
 


Preliminary Staff Recommendation: After public testimony, staff will present its recommendation to the Commission.


 


SPEAKERS:
 


Unclear name




The ___ requirements should be adjusted to the 80% HUD ___.


This is equivalent to one person making approsimately$53,000 or three person household earning $68,000 which is I think some of the questions Commissioner Antonini had.


Dropping the AMI will help the San Francisco household who earn less than 80% AMI.


The 80% AMI income bracket represents the salaries of most our public service jobs.




Dan Zymanic




We are in one of the highest land cost areas in North America.


We see construction prices rising at approximately 1% a month.


To have this change to the inclusionary housing, this represents a major change to our pro forma, a major change to how we would do business.




Hoi Yee Chun




I theory, we believe that the proposed legislation can increase the number of inclusionary housing units and make truly affordable housing for amiliesliving in single room occupancies.


Urged the Commission to support the legislation
 
 and think about, what are the more sustainable ways to help families.




Jane Cam




We've decided that affordable housing an anti-gentrification is going ot be one our our top issues in the following years.


We strongle support this legislation because it will benefit the communities.




Unclear name




We strongly believe that many families, inmigrants families will benefit from this amendment, and will also help many neighborhoods in the City.




Sarah Carlinski, San Francisco Planning Urban Research Association




It is irrefutable fact there is an enormous need for the construction of affordable housing in the City of San Francisco.


We know that there is a crisis.


It is equally irrefutable that there is also an enormous need for the construction of market reate housing.


The inclusionary housing ordinance should be structured to maximize the production of affordable housing while still encouraging the production of market rate housing.




Jazzy Collins, Community Action Network




Supports Supervisor's Daly amendment to the inclusionary housing.




Angelica Cabrandi, South of Market Community Action Network




We demand to put a top in asking San Francisco families to compete against the income of Marin and San Mateo families for basic access to housing.


Also, the concern is to provide housing for commuters.


San Francisco should expand their AMI to include all counties supported by BART, including the Alameda County AMI.




Barbara (unclear last name) Senior Action Housing Network




We need to know how much people are earning and where they are living and how they are living and if, they are living 9 to an apartment or 12 to an apartment.


Because it is the fact at we have – this a volatile situation and we have only been hearing one side of the story for many years.




Tim Coleman, Housing Action Coalition




The Housing Action Coalition favor a price point on inclusionary housing that produces the maximum amount of affordable housing of below market rate units.


We are concerned that by raising the inclusionary housing, it may cause fewer below market rate units to be produced, and some projects will become infeasible.


Strongly urge the Commission to go with the study.




Brett Gladstone, representing the Mission Preservarion Partners, the Owners of the Mission Armory
.




We would like to support the staff recommendation for a study, but, to ask very specifically that the study also include a study of preservation costs of the City Landmarks and that those be taken into account when setting an increased affordable housing percentage, and specifically the study look at whether perhaps if the percentage does go up, it not go up for landmarks.




Robert McCarthy




Mayor Newsom has made several comments recently, and I was recently as a meeting conducted by Director Macris, about the need to improve the quality of the architecture in town.


I would like to make sure you put in the study, if that in fact becomes the City's policy, what is the cost of that?


Because if you are going to ask us to increase the affordable levels, it is going to come our to something.




Unclear name, Chair, Mid-Market PAC




I would recommend we take a study and take a good look at it until anybody decides on where to go forward.


I wish we can if nothing else have an exemption for redevelopment area like Mid-Market that we can actually have some time to actually get us back on our feet.




Sue Hestor




What you have right now is the worse of all possible worlds.


If projects going through every week before you have information and your are saying you don't want legislation before you have information, but you don't fee compelled to stop approving projects.


My gust is that if I asked staff and the Commissioner how many units you have approved, a what income level, and what their sales prices are for the past year, the stuff that's opened in the past year, you wouldn't have any information.
 
 You may not even be in the ballpark. Why?
 
 Because the City does not bother tracking that information.
 
 They track permits.


No one what to say that maybe one of the problems is that the land values are crazy in this City and we need some deflation, and maybe if we change some of these policies the values will come down.




Steve (unclear last name)




I would support the staff recommendation that you urge the Board of Supervisors not to take action until your study is done.


I also would recommend that you take the full 90 tdays that you are entitled to, if Supervisor Daly or Supervisor Maxell introduce the amendments that are described in their memos to you today. Bradford-Bell

San Francisco Marina Renovation Project
- Informational presentation by the project sponsor to address comments regarding the scope of the proposed project raised by the public and the Planning Commission at the October 6, 2005 hearing on the Draft EIR for the project -
 
The proposed project is the renovation of the San Francisco Marina at 3950 Scott Street (Assessor's Block 900, Lot 003). Water-side improvements would include installation and removal of breakwater structures; reconstruction of degraded rip-rap shoreline slopes; maintenance dredging; replacement and reconfiguration of the floating docks and slips; replacement of gangways and security gates; installation and refurbishment of oily water and sewage pumpout facilities; and upgrade of electrical, water, and lighting services on the docks.
 
 Land-side improvements would include renovation of marina restroom, shower, and office buildings; conversion of the vacant former Navy Degaussing Station into office space; construction of a new 1,000-square-foot maintenance building; and restriping of existing parking lots. The project site is within a P (Public) Use District and an OS (Open Space) Height and Bulk District.
 


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 No action required. Information presentation only.


Note:
 
 This is not a hearing on the Draft EIR.
 
 The Draft EIR hearing follows as a separate item on the Planning Commission agenda.


 


SPEAKERS:
 


____, 
General Manager for the Recreation and Park Department.




Gave a brief about some of reasons why they are doing the project and the funding for the project.




Frank Rolo, Engineer




Gave a summary of the results of sub-service investigation and analysis that indicate how the Marina will behave specifically in the area of the Marina Seawall.




Joan Girardo, Appeal of Negative Declaration Requestor




I feel that this is a legal point.
 
 The Board of Supervisors by Resolution 450-94, passed a resolution which is still City policy, which says, without the Board of Supervisors of the City and the County of San Francisco urges the Mayor to pppose the construction of any additional break water in the outer west harbor.
 
 So, why has staff designed break waters for the outer west harbor?




Ray Latto




 
It is true that the docks are in such poor condition, I really do urge that the Commission take action on getting something passed.




Phil Palmer




I think that the fact this whole process has been abused in the case of bringing this draft before you, when there is – it's a draft.


We've already spent – I believe the Marina has
 
 spent something like a third of its annual budget.


I think you will ultimately that there is no negative impact and that it goes on into the next phase.


The Marina provides about a million dollars to the Rec. and Park, DPW.


So there is a million dollars of benefit that is Marina money paid that offsets the City fund.




 
Ron Mulcare




In support for the seawalls retrofitted.




Michael Spiegel




I wanted to address the fact that seems to be overlooked here is the fact that the $40 million loan for this proposed project is going to be financed by revenue bonds.


There is not an underwriter in his right mind, that is going to underwrite these revenue bonds, unless there is a guarantee stream of income that is going to pay to supply the revenue to payoff these bonds.




Alan Silver, Marina Community Association




The point that Mr. Rolo made but this will do nothing to protect the houses in the Marina seems to lose the point.


The point is that it protect the seismic retrofitting, protect the $40 million that you are putting into this project when the seawall and the spit are the northern and southern boundaries of the project.




Dick Robinson




I think we all agree that eh harbor is in disrepair and needs a major overhaul.
 


I am in favor of processing this EIR as it is currently being presented to you.




Unclear name




I am concerned about the lack – when we talk about lack of public benefits, the pathways, for the most part, after the $40 million project is done, the layperson that is not a boater that goes to this park, on the hundreds of thousands of people that use this park, probably won't even notice much which I think is sad, because $40 million is a lot money to spend when it is a public park.




Samuel Berkowitz




If this EIR has been put together as a primary method of obtaining $40 million of State of California boating funds.


Well, I think it  s fine, but I think the first thing that should have been done is to be concerned about what is bet for the harbor and what is best for the City and County of San Francisco.




Suzanne Liston




I am here on behalf of Fort Mason Foundation as well as National Park Service and I can say thankfully that we would like to say the draft EIR remain a draft until some specifics, may specifics are addressed.




John Evans




I'd like to speak in favor of moving this process forward and in favor of the Draft EIR.




Gloria Fontanello




Urged the Commission to find a way to find something to help with the seawalls.
 


I think this is a matter of public safety.

San Francisco Marina Renovation Project
- Public hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) -
 
The proposed project is the renovation of the San Francisco Marina at 3950 Scott Street (Assessor's Block 900, Lot 003). Water-side improvements would include installation and removal of breakwater structures; reconstruction of degraded rip-rap shoreline slopes; maintenance dredging; replacement and reconfiguration of the floating docks and slips; replacement of gangways and security gates; installation and refurbishment of oily water and sewage pumpout facilities; and upgrade of electrical, water, and lighting services on the docks.
 
 Land-side improvements would include renovation of marina restroom, shower, and office buildings; conversion of the vacant former Navy Degaussing Station into office space; construction of a new 1,000-square-foot maintenance building; and restriping of existing parking lots. The project site is within a P (Public) Use District and an OS (Open Space) Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 No action required. Public hearing to receive comments only.


Note:
 
 A public hearing on the Draft EIR was held on October 6, 2005.
 
 An additional hearing on the Draft EIR has been calendared at the request of the Planning Commission.
 
 The public review period has been extended to 5 p.m. on January 19, 2006.


 


SPEAKERS:


Ron Mulcare




If Recreation and Park has not been able to maintain this facility – in other words, they say they've got 40 yeas of deferred maintenance, how are they going to do it in the future?




Michael Spiegel




I wanted to raise a point that the draft EIR as to this thousand foot maintenance building does not consider any alternative.


It is my understanding that an EIR is supposed to consider alternatives.


The major alternative not considered is that this thing can be located somewhere else, other than right there in the middle of this East Marina Green.




Alan Silverman




The comment in the EIR is that it really does not affect the view because the view is obstructed by trees anyhow.


Now, I am not quiet sure how environmentally trees look the same as a building.




Michael Candor




The DEIR is deficient and inadequate, it does not identify the Bay trail along or even within the project boundaries.


It does not analyze those impacts and it does not identify mitigations to those impacts.




Maureen Gaffney




Asked the Commission the DEIR would address the bay trail plan and policies in the Final EIR and work on some mitigation for the trail.




Sue Chang




Respectfully request that there be a review for the historic preservation of this mall.


The draft EIR basically says that this mall is used for sport fishing and that those fishermen can go along the seawall. I do not believe that is accurate.




Joan Girardo




The description is incomplete and inaccurate.


It fails to state the linear feet of docks will be added and the project deletes 3 82 berths for small boats.


Restripping of the parking lots is not defined.
 
 Adding parking would be against the City's general plan which states that land uses which can be located other than on the shoreline should be.


The final design and project components have not been presented.
 


We can not determine environmental impacts or effects of projects components without final design.




Nathaniel Berkowitz




I want to speak to the fact that the water change and water quality within the harbor itself is very poor and very dirty.


It takes a number of days for the water to completely change.


The solution to this problem is available to s and should be investigated with an outlet at the west end of the existing harbor.




Gloria Fontanello




Let's not look back and say we made a big mistake and spent a lot of taxpayer dollars which we had the alternative or repair and replace.


IF we can all think for a minute, the small Marina Green to which we are referring is sandy area, and about $300,000 was spent of ADA money because they wanted access down there.




Dick Robinson




I do not believe that there will be any negative impact on the sailing operation or people coming in and out of the harbor.




Emery Coleman


The process is broken.
 
 There some State laws also, not only City laws.

Request for Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit Application No. 2004.12.16.1639 proposing to construct a three-story horizontal addition
 
 at the rear of a three-story single-family residence in an RH-1 (Residential, House, One-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
 


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Take Discretionary Review and approve the project with modifications.


 


SPEAKERS:


Walter Kaplan, representing Noel and Denise Turner, Discretionary Review requestors




The very character of the neighborhood is defined by the design and these homes.
 


These homes are built with sun rooms


They were not additions.


They are part of the design and the original character of this neighborhood.


Views of the shared open space are common to all these 12
th
 Avenue homes.


This project is no more compatible with the neighborhood today in its present form that it was in its initial conception.


The neighbors have raised many objections, among them the issue of privacy and how this project will certainly compromise the privacy of neighbors.




Jane Powell, Restoration Consultant




This block is a remarkably intact collection or urban arts and crafts homes.


A prominent arts and crafts belief was a important connection to nature and emphasis on sunlight, fresh air and bringing the outdoors in.


Unlike suburban homes, these houses have been provided with that connection only in the back where bummed out sun rooms and large pictures windows overlook the back yards up and down the block as though there was an interior park just for the residents.


The proposed changes only move the project from horrible to merely repugnant.




James Hutton




The neighborh hope, I think very much to protect their shared community gardens, their rear yards, their sunlight and their views.


Urged the Commission to continue this item, so we could have story poles up and the rest of the neighborhood could meet at the Turner's residence to talk about it.




Tom Turman, Architect for this project




Gave a general summary about the project.




Joe Sue, Property Owner




The Turner's feel that our house is too big and families do not need all that much space.


We are asking for us to be able to grow – that our house be able to evolve with us.




Angela Sue




Asked Commission to vote for this project to move forward.




Jerry Sue




Please vote in favor of our project.

Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project as submitted.


 


SPEAKERS:


Steve Courier




The soul remaining
 
 issue is not a planning issue.


The project is owned by two people.


The Discretionary Review requestor says the other owner does not have permission to do this.




No name stated, Discretionary Review requestor




This property is owned by three people.


A month ago one of the owners signed over for the purposes of getting a loan, just to be able to refinance the house and get a better rate.


I was waiting for the transfer back, but it did not happen and I do not authorize any changes to the house.


The reason she appears as an owner, because I did not have money to hire a lawyer to file a lawsuit.




Javier Solis, Project Sponsor




We have two files and recorded with the Recorder's Office back in October of last year. Both signed by Mr. Carlos Ramiro.


As far a planning compliance, I believe that the project itself is in full compliance and we have even a letter of suppor from the adjacent neighbor.
