Market & Octavia Neighborhood Plan
 
- 
Certification of Final Environmental Impact Report.
 
 
T
he project area lies to the west of the City's downtown financial district and sits at the junction of several neighborhoods, including, Civic Center, Hayes Valley, Western Addition, South of Market, Inner Mission, the Castro, Duboce Triangle, Eureka Valley, and Upper Market.
 
 
The proposed neighborhood plan would reclassify the existing zoning from Residential Districts (R), Neighborhood Commercial Districts (NCD's), Moderate-Scale Neighborhood Commercial (NC-3), and Heavy Commercial (C-M) to Downtown General Commercial Districts (C-3-G), Residential Transit Oriented (RTO), Neighborhood Commercial Transit Districts (NCT), Neighborhood Commercial-Transit, Moderate-Scale Mixed Use Districts (NCT-3). It would also increase height limits in certain areas and reduce height limits in other areas.
 
 The proposed zoning and height reclassifications would increase the potential for residential development in the area.


Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the Final Environmental Impact Report.
 


Please note: The public review period for the Draft Environmental Impact Report is closed.
 
 The Planning Commission does not conduct public review of Final EIRs. Public comments on the certification may be presented to the Planning Commission during the Public Comment portion of the Commission calendar

Certification of a Final Environmental Impact Report
:
 
 The proposed project would involve demolition of three existing light industrial buildings and construction of a 5-story, 50 foot-tall building containing 134 single-room occupancy-type very low-income dwelling units for homeless adults with onsite access to supportive services, and one unit for an onsite resident property manager. The project would contain residential support services on the ground floor as well as a leasable commercial space with its frontage on Folsom Street. The project would provide 11 off-street staff parking spaces in an at-grade garage accessible from Dore Street. The three buildings on the project site: 275 10th Street, 1350 Folsom Street and 64-72 Dore Street, constructed in 1931 and 1922 respectively, are considered historical resources under CEQA for their contextual importance to a potential historic district in the South of Market Area. Accordingly, the DEIR identified significant unavoidable impacts associated with the demolition of these buildings. The DEIR also identified significant unavoidable impacts associated with the cumulative loss of PDR land, building space, and jobs in the greater Western Soma planning area. The project site is within an SLR (Service/Light Industrial/Residential) Zoning District and 50-X Height and Bulk District. 
Please note: The public review period for the Draft Environmental Impact Report is closed.
 
 The Planning Commission does not conduct public review of Final EIRs. Public comments on the certification may be presented to the Planning Commission during the Public Comment portion of the Commission calendar.


Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the Final Environmental Impact Report.

SPEAKERS


Anthony Richards, Project Sponsor


-
 
 We bought the house five years ago and our family is growing. 
 
We have two children and need the extra space.


-
 
 We have three objectives in mind for this project: increase livable space, add a garage because of difficulties of street parking, and improve our front entrance.


-
 
 Our plan has been generously well received by our neighbors with the exception of the Discretionary Review requestor.


-
 
 I believe he has two issues: consistent features on the block and height affecting air/light in the courtyard.


-
 
 We have maintained the roof shape at the front. 
 
The entry would be an addition and we are keeping the character of the block.


-
 
 The addition of the porch would improve the privacy to our neighbor.
 
 Currently, there is a view at eye level to the front neighbor.


-
 
 Our plan develops a house that would meet our family needs and we believe is not going to adversely impact our neighbors.


Kuh-kun Lui, Discretionary Review Requestor [Translated]


-
 
 
I am against this project because according to the prints the structure is going to improve the neighborhood but it is an obstruction.
 
 Please review the plans.


-
 
 
The proposal is too high affecting light and air circulation of the neighbors.


-
 
 
The proposed new windows cause unsafe conditions and it would be difficult for people to live peaceful.


-
 
 
The height should be decreased and windows should be set back three feet.


-
 
 
I do not speak English and this is very difficult for me because I have a lot of issues.


-
 
 
Gutters are too high and are obstructing the stairway and I can not go through.


-
 
 
I had contacted the City to come and look at the property and nothing happened.


-
 
 
Everything they did is not stable.
 
 I am totally against this project and think it is very unsafe.


 


ACTION:
 
 Did not take discretionary review and approved with instructions to staff to continue working with the Project Sponsor on the roof type.

 Plan Area


The Plan encompasses an irregularly shaped area in northeast San Francisco. It extends two to three blocks in width along Market Street for ten blocks and extends north along the former Central Freeway alignment at Octavia Boulevard for ten blocks. Along Market Street, the Plan Area boundaries extend from 11th and Larkin Streets in the east to Noe and Scott Streets in the west.
 
 The boundary jogs north along Noe Street, Duboce Avenue, Scott Street, Waller Street, Webster Street, Oak Street, Buchanan Street, and Grove Street; continues north along the former Central Freeway alignment to include the area up toTurk Street between Laguna and Franklin Streets; and east of Franklin Street jogs south to Grove and Larkin Streets. The Project Area boundary extends south of Market Street between 10th and 11th Street to Howard Street. Extending west along Howard Street, the Project Area boundaries jog along Division, Clinton, Stevenson, Fourteenth, Guerrero, and Sixteenth Streets. The Project Area is comprised of 89 Assessor's Blocks in entirety or in part, including the whole of Blocks 759, 761, 768, 770, 783, 785, 792 to 794, 806 to 809, 813 to 819, 830 to 841, 850 to 858, 863 to 876, 3501 to 3506, 3512 to 3514, 3533 to 3538, 3541 to 3545, 3556 to 3560; and
 
 portions of 3507 (lot 40), 3510 (lots 49, 57), 3511 (lots 1, 23, 25, 31, 33, 74, 75, 80, 82, and 93), and 3532 (lots 14, 19B, 35, 36, 88, 89, 90 and 91).


 


Specifically, the Commission will consider the following items and may take action on or after December 14, 2006:
 


 


Â·Ã°
 
 
Case 2003.0347E – Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report
 and 
adoption of CEQA Findings
 on the Market and Octavia Plan.
 


 


Â·Ã°
 
 
Case 2003.0347M -
 a proposed 
General Plan amendment
 that would add a new area plan, the Market and Octavia Area Plan, and make related amendments to the Commerce and Industry, Housing, Recreation and Open Space and Transportation Elements, the Civic Center Area Plan, Downtown Area Plan, South of Market Area Plan and the Land Use Index;
 


 


Â·Ã°
 
 
Case 2003.0347T -
 a proposed 
Planning Code text amendment
 that would revise Planning Code controls, including controls for land use, height and bulk, building design, loading, parking and establish new fees;


 


Â·Ã°
 
 
Case 2003.0347Z -
 a proposed 
Zoning Map amendment
 that would revise Maps 2 and 2H, 7 and 7H, and 2SU and 7SU.
 
 The proposed Planning Code text and map (Zoning Map) amendments would a) establish three new zoning districts, b) amend the Hayes-Gough, Upper Market, and Valencia Neighborhood Commercial Districts (NCDs), c) update height and bulk districts, d) establish the Market and Octavia Community Improvements Impact Fee, and e) make related revisions necessary to implement the General Plan.
 
 The proposed changes are described in greater detail in Case 2003.0347T (above).
 


 


Together, these four Commission actions are intended to implement the Market and Octavia Plan.
 


 


 
 In addition, an historic survey is currently being done of the project area; property owners considering constructing
 
 or altering a building in this area should consult with Planning Department staff to determine
 
 the historic resource status of their property.
 
 Property owners and interested parties are advised that height limits and other controls do not provide unqualified rights to development, but rather, proscribe the maximum potential building envelope that may be permitted; proposed buildings may not reach the maximum permitted building height/envelope.
 


 


Members of the public may review a copy of the proposed amendments at the San Francisco Planning Department office at 1660 Mission Street 5th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94103, at the Public Library (the Main Library 100 Larkin St., and Harvey Milk branch library, 1 Jose Sarria Ct. (near 16th & Market Sts.).
 
 An electronic copy of the proposed amendments and actions is available at
 
http://marketoctavia.betterneighborhoods.org
.
 


 


As part of 
Case No. 2003.0347T
, the proposed Planning Code text amendment would revise Planning Code controls, including controls for land use, height and bulk, building design, loading, parking and establish new fees.
 
 The proposed amendments are described more fully below:


 


 
 
Establishment of Three Zoning Districts in the Plan Area


The 
Transit-Oriented Residential Use District
(RTO)
 
will replace most of the RH and RM districts zoning north and south of the Market Street corridor, extending north to Turk Street, west to Noe and Scott Streets, and South to Sixteenth Street. The proposed RTO district will encourage moderate-density, multi-family, and residential infill. Because of the availability of transit service, proximity of retail and services within walking distance, and limitation on permitted parking the RTO permits the construction of some housing without accessory parking. Parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing within buildings in keeping with neighborhood scale. Proposed heights in 
Residential Transit Oriented (RTO)
 Districts and RH districts primarily remain 40 and 50 feet as currently classified; in some 
RTO
 areas, permitted heights will change from 50, 80 and 105 feet to 40 and 50 feet.


 


A 
Neighborhood Commercial Transit District (NCT)
 will
 overlay the Hayes-Gough Neighborhood Commercial District and portions of the Upper Market and Valencia Neighborhood Commercial Districts within the Market and Octavia neighborhood.
 
 In 
named NCT and NC-1 (T) districts
, parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing above ground-floor retail uses. These districts will largely keep the existing specific use-size controls. They include current Neighborhood Commercial Districts (Hayes-Gough, portions of the Upper Market, Valencia) and several parcels currently zoned NC-1.
 


 


The 
Van Ness and Market Downtown Residential Special Use District (VNMDR-SUD)
 will permit the development of a transit-oriented, high-density, mixed-use neighborhood around the intersections of Van Ness Avenue and Market Street and South Van Ness Avenue and Mission Street.
 
 This SUD will overlay existing C-3-G districts and existing C-M districts will be rezoned to C-3-G with this new VNMDR-SUD. Parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing in buildings with mixed-used podiums and some residential towers at two key intersections: Market Street and Van Ness Avenue and Mission Street and South Van Ness Avenue. Proposed heights in the 
Van Ness and Market Downtown Residential Use District (VNMDR-SUD)
 will change from 120, 130, 150, 160, 200 and 320 feet to 85, 120, 200, 320 and 400 feet; towers will be permitted over a podium of 85 or 120 feet; the highest towers will be permitted in the vicinity of the Market Street/Van Ness Avenue intersections.
 


 


In the 
Transit-Oriented Neighborhood Commercial Use Districts (NCT
),
 height districts will change from 50, 80 and 105 feet to primarily 55, 65 and 85 feet; these districts will be located in SoMa West and along Market Street. The NCT district will largely replace C-M and NC-3 districts. In the 
NCT district
, parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing above ground-floor retail uses. These districts will largely keep the existing specific use-size controls in place in the NC-3 district. Some heights on some parcels near Brady Street will change from 105 and 60 feet to 40 feet and 85 feet on parcels surrounding a proposed public open space.


 


 
 Establishment of New Fees in the Plan Area


In order to fund the community improvements identified in the Plan, the Program document proposes to establish a 
Development Impact Fee
, requiring the growth that generates the demand for additional infrastructure and services to provide some of the revenue required to fund the improvements.
 
 The proposal establishes a development impact fee on new residential and commercial development in the Plan Area.
 
 The fee proposal is $10.00 per square foot of residential development, and $4.00 per square foot of commercial development.
 


 


To encourage the provision of necessary and desirable public infrastructure improvements and also in order to mitigate the impacts of this increased localized density, the Department has established the 
Van Ness and Market Neighborhood Infrastructure Fund
. Developers may provide in-kind public improvements (such as open space or streetscape improvements) or proportional in-lieu contributions to this fund that will allow the city to develop these facilities. The Department estimates that no more than 6 potential development sites would benefit from participating in the program. The Department has set the value of the additional FAR at par with the current market value of historic TDR credits ($15 per square foot).


 
 
Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 No action requested


 


SPEAKERS


James Haas


-
 
 
I am here to talk about short-term parking.
 
 Some of the supply of parking lots that were available for short term parking has been taken. 
 
There is a shortage of it.


-
 
 
There is the potential of expanding the garage of the Performing Arts.


-
 
 
Next door to the Performing Arts' garage is one of the affordable housing sites for the formerly homeless.


Richard Henderson


-
 
 
I would like to talk about the projected large condominium structure on Buchannan and Market Street.


-
 
 
Construction should not be an obstruction.
 
 Buildings should be enhancements for the neighborhood. 
 
Therefore, I am requesting that you reduce the density of it.


-
 
 
As proposed, it would violate the standards that we agreed on.
 
 It would destroy the light and harmony established in the neighborhood.


Peter Lewis, Mission Dolores Neighborhood Association


-
 
 
We are very concerned about this plan because of how is going to impact our district.


-
 
 
Our goal is to make Mission Dolores a historic district.


-
 
 
The increased scrutiny level mentioned before is minute in our district.


-
 
 
We already have reduced parking.
 
 Every weekend there are so many cars in the area


-
 
 
We need your help.
 
 One of the solutions is to give us one-to-one parking on the southern part of .Market Street.


Joe Curtin


-
 
 
My concern in particular is the one-to-one parking.
 
 It should be allowed in the new constructions in the Mission Dolores Neighborhood.


-
 
 
Parking along the Dolores and Valencia corridors is intolerable.


Tom Radulovich


-
 
 
As a resident of the Mission Dolores area I would say that the character of our district is being threatened by The Planning Department's controls.


-
 
 
You would notice by walking in the neighborhood that the Victorian houses have very narrow garage doors on 17
th
 and Dolores Streets.
 
 This is ruining our district.


-
 
 
New constructions should be incorporated into the character of the neighborhood.


-
 
 
There should be more planning on traffic.


Kate White


-
 
 
This plan is visionary, sensible and calls for clustery developments on the transit corridors.


-
 
 
It includes important protection for historic preservation.


-
 
 
She urged the support of this plan.


Alan Martinez, Landmark Preservation Advisory Board


-
 
 
You have received two letters from the Landmark Board about the issues on preservation in the Market/Octavia Plan.


-
 
 
The basic goal for us is that the planning works to make sure that the policies of the plan do not impact historic resources.


-
 
 
One of the issues not mentioned is determining the boundaries of the scrutiny areas.


Tim Colen


-
 
 
This was a wonderful presentation and captured why we like the plan and want to go forward.


-
 
 
We are interested in historic preservation and are encouraged with the guidelines and interim controls.


-
 
 
We strongly support the Hayes Valley Neighborhood Association on the issues of parking.


-
 
 
Do not delay any further your support of this plan.


Laura Tashan


-
 
 
I just found out about the projected 80-foot condominium site on Buchanan and Market Streets.


-
 
 
I have a petition with 26 signatures from residents that they believe this would impact the light, air and view.


-
 
 
I believe that for this type of large building two entrances for parking should be required.


Craig O'Connor


-
 
 
These concerns about the 80-foot building should be considered because it would impact life quality by obstructing light and air.


-
 
 
Density is another concern.
 
 There might be 10,000 new neighbors with this plan.


Richard, Eureka Valley resident


-
 
 
We were shocked when we found out that Eureka Valley is included in the plan area.


-
 
 
We would like our area to be cut it from the plan area.
 
 We do not really relate to Hayes Valley for the Market/Octavia plan.


Chris Peterson


-
 
 
I would like to speak in particular to the parking requirements.
 
 The neighborhood is very well served by transit and has easy access to the freeway.


-
 
 
The plan should continue promoting pedestrian oriented patterns and not encourage automobile dependent people.


Ruben Levitt


-
 
 
I would like to address the parking issue.


-
 
 
In the area there are buildings that have garages and it seems that no cars are parked there.
 
 Garages are used for storage.


-
 
 
This plan is a comprehensive one.
 
 All the elements work together and it is important to keep the integrity of it than piece it out.


-
 
 
Developments in the pipeline are waiting for this plan to move forward.


Lynn Craton, Hayes Valley Neighborhood Association


-
 
 
We need to address the problem of automobile abundance.
 
 I support the parking limitations.


-
 
 
I urge you to approve the plan without the completion of the historic survey.


Paul Olsen, Hayes Valley Neighborhood Association


-
 
 
There was an important word used during the presentation and that is balance.


-
 
 
The community has truly come together to have a plan that is fully community based.


-
 
 
We need to go forward and have this plan adopted.


-
 
 
People choose to live in certain areas and we need to honor those choices.
 
 All areas in the city do not need to be the same.


-
 
 
We need to give people the choice of living in an area that is pedestrian oriented.


Jason Henderson


-
 
 
The summary this evening is really compromising.


-
 
 
We are willing to move this process forward.
 
 What needs to happen is a better management of off-street parking spaces.


Steve Vettel


-
 
 
The original idea for this plan was to have community consensus of what development should be in the area.


-
 
 
The trade off was to eliminate case by case discretion.


-
 
 
I recommend that you direct staff to look into the 309 compliance process rather than a CU [Conditional Use] process for development sites that are consistent with the plan.


Joe Curtin, President of Castro Area Planning and Action


-
 
 
We have been active with this process since the beginning.


-
 
 
We support incorporating the conditional use requirements in the plan.


-
 
 
It would help to ensure that new developments are going to help the neighborhood.


-
 
 
We support eliminating the minimum parking requirements and instituting maximum parking along Market Street.


Hiroshi Fukuda


-
 
 
I do not live in the plan area.
 
 This is a very small city and we are not isolated.
 
 It is going to impact everybody.


-
 
 
Parking is very difficult here.
 
 It is hard to digest everything that is going on.


Curt Holzinger, Duboce Triangle Neighborhood Association


-
 
 
There was a discussion in our association that we want to continue the conversation on density.


-
 
 
We support having no parking to increase more housing.


-
 
 
Our main concern is that high density would slowly erode the historic character of that neighborhood overtime.


-
 
 
As far as the process, I would like to find out how we get specific answers to suggestions we have made.


-
 
 
We are trying to make a few requests of things that do not apply to our area and we would present them at the next meeting.


Ruven Hannah


-
 
 
I am very concerned with the feature of the projected complex of an 80 foot site.


-
 
 
The quality of our lives is going to be impacted by it obstructing light and air.


Sarah Karlinsky, SPUR


-
 
 
The main thing to keep in mind about this plan is that it is oriented in one of the most important transit corridors in the city.


-
 
 
If we are going to increase density in the city, this is the right area to do it.


Judith Berkowitz, Coalition for San Francisco Neighborhood


-
 
 
The records show that parking will be built down the road when one-to-one parking ratios are not built in with new construction.


-
 
 
Those who want to eliminate cars from this plan are diluting themselves.


-
 
 
This body should have blanket prohibition against parking that should be written into the plan.


-
 
 
The residents of San Francisco have no idea that its officials are eliminating the minimum parking requirement which is one-to-one.


-
 
 
We urge you to have a contingency plan in place.


Peter Cohen


-
 
 
There is no increase in transit capacity for the increased density.
 
 This is a solid cutting edge of this plan.


-
 
 
The question is how these comments would be responded to and be used to refine this plan.


-
 
 
Thoughtful comments by member of the public that live in the area should be very informative to get this plan to work.


Dennis Richards, President of Duboce Triangle Neighborhood Association


-
 
 
Thanked staff for the presentation and allowing participation from the community.


-
 
 
There are a lot of good things in this plan that we support.


-
 
 
We know there would be additional growth and we are willing to support what we can handle.


-
 
 
Market Street is a unique area and we support no parking and density limits along that street.


Tim Dunn


-
 
 
I live in the project area and parking is a big issue.


-
 
 
We recently bought a unit and we were able to purchase it because it has no parking.


-
 
 
Housing affordability is something to consider when talking about parking.


-
 
 
Since we are looking to increase density, we should be looking into it as a source of funds for affordable housing.


 


 


Ali Kia Shabahangi


-
 
 
I would like to express my full support.
 
 We are one of the projects in the pipeline proposing senior affordable housing.


-
 
 
I urge to approve the plan.


Leigh Stackpole


-
 
 
Expressed full support for the Market/Octavia plan.


-
 
 
I would like to see Hayes Street as a two\way street implemented.
 
 Also, pedestrian cross walks should be implemented on Hayes/Gough Streets and Gough/Sutter Streets.


-
 
 
Safety should be a priority.


-
 
 
I would really like to see the south side of Market be a priority as a green area like the North side of Market.


James Warshell


-
 
 
I very much support this plan.
 
 We had numerous meetings to educate ourselves about it.


-
 
 
Staff has worked very hard to reach out to the community and I can hardly believe that anyone has not had a chance to share suggestions and ideas.


 


Around 6:00 p.m. the Planning Commission recessed to hold a joint meeting with the Building Inspection Commission in room 250.
 
 The remainder of this calendar [as indicated by the items below] took place at the conclusion of the joint meeting.
 
 The Planning Commission's meeting resumed around 10:00 p.m.


 


[No name]


-
 
 
There is a soil compression along Van Ness and Market.


-
 
 
You should bring that issue up with the geotechnical people.


Rufino DeLeon Jr.


-
 
 
I am in very much support of the plan.


-
 
 
On the parking issue: 
 
residents that can not meet their transit needs would purchase a car if it is the only feasible transportation available.


-
 
 
It is better to include parking choices now then trying to take care of it later.


-
 
 
I would prefer to see large developments with underground garages than vehicles clogging the streets.


Sue Hestor


-
 
 
You should ask your staff to do some isometric drawings of the plan.


-
 
 
This plan has had very good participation from Hayes Valley.
 
 There are implications for Noe Valley.
 
 Eureka Valley did not have the same opportunity to participate.


-
 
 
I would respectfully ask staff to request developers to go out and talk to people in the neighborhood.


-
 
 
We need to talk about 400-foot towers on Market and Van Ness Avenue.

 Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).

Future Meetings/Agendas

 At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.


 


Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 Regarding the hearing we just had on the Market/Octavia Plan:


-
 
 It was useful to hear about seismic issues.


-
 
 It is critical to make sure that any construction has good anchors – good foundations.


-
 
 There was a question on affordable housing in the area because it is going to be redeveloped.


-
 
 I do not know if redevelopment means affordable and I would like to know about that in the near future.


-
 
 In terms of the issues brought up tonight, the most important is the one between the 309 process and the conditional use process.


-
 
 It seems that there is mixed feelings as to what is appropriate.


-
 
 In the 309 process things are approved as-of-right more or less if they conform, as opposed to a CU on everything.


-
 
 A lot of the public was a little confused because no project has to necessarily have a stated amount of parking.


-
 
 Most people expressed concerns about wanting no parking at all and some would like to have less and that is something that we need to look at.


-
 
 Making the argument that there would be more cars driving around because people use their garages as storage is not really an argument that I would buy.


-
 
 The big difference on Valencia and Dolores Streets is that entertainment has increased and I do not think that residents are the ones needing the parking.


-
 
 I was looking at the density question that came back and we need to look at the land use.


-
 
 Those are my main comments in terms of what we heard today.


Commissioner Moore


-
 
 Regarding tonight's joint meeting with the Building Inspection Commission:


-
 
 I would like to reiterate the need that we continue talking on safety in terms of seismic and fire as we move into Market/Octavia.


-
 
 The issues are more profound than we have thought so far and we need to look at them.


-
 
 I encourage that the Fire Marshall indeed will be asked to attend and hope that even DBI will be able to come to some of the meetings we are having.


-
 
 In addition to that, I would like to ask Ms. Dennis to perhaps encourage those people who left earlier to watch the tapes of this evening's meeting because I think it is essential for a really successful collaboration between all of us.

SPEAKERS


Sue Hestor


-
 
 The Commission should have a policy directive to staff that no case should be calendared until the environmental document is complete.


-
 
 I have a case that is coming up in January that was put on the calendar at the end of October.


-
 
 Categorical Exemption was not done and I have no idea when it is coming out.


-
 
 It is controversial.
 
 Documents should be available to the public when it is put on the calendar.


-
 
 It [Department/staff practice] is not going to change unless the Commission tells staff to do so.


Joan Girardoi


-
 
 The FEIR [Final Environmental Impact Report] for the Harbor is coming on January 11.


-
 
 The Army Corps of Engineers has standards for levis in New Orleans and for sea walls.


-
 
 Perhaps a member of your staff could research that and there may be a link to require that our sea walls be retrofitted.


-
 
 This has been going on for seventeen years.
 
 It is not covered under the Building Code or any code of the city, but they are covered under the army corps.


-
 
 We should find a way to get it done as part of this project.
