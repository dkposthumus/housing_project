 It belongs to Joe Cassidy.


-
 
 A lot of money has been spent to do data on this project.

 I would like to take you all on a tour at the Bayview Hunters Point and really look at what the community is out there.

SPEAKERS


Judith Hoyam, Board member of Friends of 1800


-
 
 
We are dedicated to protect the City's Historic Resources.


-
 
 
This garage addition would remove 2 parking spaces near shopping centers.


-
 
 The curb cut would appropriate for private use space that belongs to the City and general public and would remove a mature tree.


-
 
 
In the 1900 nothing was constructed on Hartford Street and in 1902 it was all full.


-
 
 Every house was setback for landscaping.
 
 It is the simple characteristic of this block.
 
 None of the houses were constructed with garages.


-
 
 
It was created that way to provide open space.


-
 
 We are asking the Commission to require that an independent historic evaluation by a qualified consultant be part of the Environmental Report.


Mark Paez, Chair of Friends of 1800 and Co-Chair of Duboce Triangle Neighborhood Association


-
 
 This Planning Department really needs some policy guidance from this Commission to elevate this process and make more qualitative analysis for these types of proposals.


-
 
 This project in particular needs historic resource evaluation, environmental review, and careful policy consideration.
 
 We believe it is not ready for approval.


-
 
 Numerous garage additions to constructions in the Castro and Eureka Valley are being approved by the department without adequate historic evaluation and environmental review and in conflict with the criteria for the garage guidelines.


-
 
 The project is also contrary to the Transit First Policy of the General Plan and also the intentions of the Market-Octavia Plan by promoting the no longer required off-street parking.


-
 
 Take DR and require additional analysis.


Charles Chase, Executive Director of San Francisco Heritage


-
 
 This project does not conform to the Planning Department procedure for garage additions and we question the validity of staff comments on the [Secretary of] Interior Standards application in this case.


-
 
 There has not been adequate environmental review and it violates the Transit First policy of the General Plan in the Planning Department.


-
 
 Insertion of garages has a potential negative impact on San Francisco's historic resources.


-
 
 It should be fully reviewed to determine the extent of the historic fabric loss, the applicability of the Interior Standards, and how the project meets the current policies and those proposed in the Market-Octavia Plan.


Susan


-
 
 I want to echo the Friends of 1800's concern of the historic character of the neighborhood and the impact there.


-
 
 
I wonder how the garage is going in without considering the mature tree.


-
 
 Finally, I have a concern about parking and taking these public parking spaces to convert it to private space.
 
 It would take away three spaces with the curb cut.


Marcus Connen, Owner


-
 
 The house needs a lot of work. 
 
The entrance way and back porch are rotted and need to be replaced. 
 
It needs new bathroom and kitchen.


-
 
 
The building is on a non-cement foundation and needs to be reinforced.


-
 
 The cost of this project is about $400,000 to renovate the building to the point that these units could be rented or to sell it. 
 
Currently it is my primary residence.


-
 
 It is virtually impossible to rent or sell a house in the Castro without parking. 
 
The parking is going to be underground and it is that way on many houses on the block.


Gordon Atkinson, Architect


-
 
 The Planning Department has confirmed that this project conforms to the guidelines and regulations.


-
 
 The mandate of the Commission is to review projects only when there are extraordinary circumstances.


-
 
 We are asking permission to bring the building into compliance with DCP parking requirements for new residents, and to restore the historic ornamentation.


-
 
 There are no sidewalk improvements or removal of trees.
 
 We are proposing to build new concrete benches along the side walk as an amenity.


-
 
 
There is nothing extraordinary or exceptional about this project.


-
 
 
This property is not a landmark designation nor is it in a historic district.

Request for Conditional Use Authorization
 under Sections 711.26 and 303 of the Planning Code to legalize an existing automatic teller machine (ATM) walk-up facility, installed without providing a 3-foot setback from the front property line.
 
 The ATM, which was installed without permit, is an accessory use to the existing tobacco shop (d.b.a. Good Fellows Smoke Shop) which houses the medical cannabis dispensary described in part (b) below.
 
 The property is located in an NC-2 (Small-Scale Neighborhood Commercial) Zoning District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
 


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Approval with conditions.


 


SPEAKERS


Brian Kuester, on behalf of Project Sponsor for item 8a


-
 
 When the project sponsor purchased the business, the ATM had been in place three years by then.
 
 They had no idea that there was no permit for it.


-
 
 As soon as they were notified by the department that a permit was required, they filed immediately.


-
 
 
The charge for the use of the ATM is $1.50 where most other places charge $2.50


-
 
 
If anybody has a problem, the owners handle it right away.


Danny Parker, General Council for Swipe USA LLC - Project Sponsor Representative for item 8c


-
 
 
We have an alliance with Designer Brand.


-
 
 
 Swipe' has been managing ATM's for seven years.
 
 They follow banking guidelines.


-
 
 One of the concerns is graffiti at this location and I want to assure you that Designer Brands owner works carefully with  Swipe' to ensure that any graffiti is removed clean within 24 hours.


-
 
 
 Swipe' is a very responsible business and engages with the Police Department's Patrol Division.


-
 
 
We have neighborhood support.


-
 
 I urge you to apply fundamental fairness to both ATM's and look at the contributions to the community.


Jeff Christen


-
 
 I just want to point out that this belongs to the Cannabis Club and they will use the funds from the cannabis to fill the ATM machine.


-
 
 I do not know how legal that is.
 
 Imagine having an ATM and everything else at this one location


Gary Bell [8c]


-
 
 I am here in support of the ATM.
 
 The very first goal of the Commerce Industry section of the General Plan is to maintain healthy and diverse economy.


-
 
 There are no banks anywhere within easy walking distances.


-
 
 In addition to contributing to the local economy, there is no adverse impact on city services from this machine.


-
 
 The machine has been in this location for over a year.


Hasah Khader, Designer Brands Owner


-
 
 
I have been doing business on Haight Street for the last 15 years.


-
 
 
There were no ATM machines before and now we have more.


-
 
 
There are no complaints and it is helping to bring more people to spend more money in our community.


-
 
 
Many residents and merchants support the idea of having both ATM's on our street.


Laurence Odhner


-
 
 I am the former owner of this place and during the interim term I noticed that other merchants added ATM's and none have been turned down, to the best of my knowledge.


-
 
 
To turn down Mr. Khader's request, which is as valid as the others, it would be highly discriminatory.


Marwan Ouziz, Technical Manager for Swipe Management Company


-
 
 
Approve the conditional use.


-
 
 Swipe has been a respectful member of the San Francisco Business community and has extended the amount of service to our customers.


Scott Hart, San Francisco Patrol Special Police


-
 
  Swipe' has hired our services to patrol the ATM's at night and make sure that there are no problems.


-
 
 
If there are any problems, they call Marwan and he contacts us to go out.


Rodney


-
 
 The impression is that the ATM being next to the medical marijuana dispensary will bring a negative type of traffic.
 
 There could be a problem with marijuana and money.


-
 
 
We are going backwards in the City.
 
 Look at the fact that there is more marijuana in the Haight.
 
 Putting money next to the dispensary is not a good idea.


Michael Aldrich


-
 
 
I am here in support of having the ATM's at both locations.


-
 
 
I want to raise a couple of points; Mohna has worked very hard to have the medical dispensary working properly and this ATM brings accessibility to people in a wheel chair.


-
 
 
This ATM charges only $1.5 which is much less than most ATM's.


Juli Carter


-
 
 
There were no ATM's before in the area.


-
 
 
Walgreens put in the first and now there are a few.
 
 There is a need for an ATM on Sundays.


-
 
 These are the only ones available on Sundays when people come to the neighborhood and need to buy stuff or dine in the area.


Rev. Randi Webster


-
 
 I'm speaking in favor of both ATM's because of accessibility for patients of the Medical Dispensary and because the community needs this service.

Mandatory Discretionary Review,
 under Planning Code
 
Sections 711.84 and
 
790.141(h)
 
requiring review of Medical Cannabis Dispensaries (MCDs), of Building Permit Application No. 2005.07.22.8399, to maintain the operation of an existing medical cannabis dispensary within an existing retail space occupied by a tobacco shop (d.b.a. Good Fellows Smoke Shop). The property is located in an NC-2 (Small-Scale Neighborhood Commercial) Zoning District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
 


Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project as proposed.


 


SPEAKERS


Brian Kuester, on behalf of Project Sponsor


-
 
 The project sponsors have demonstrated to the medical cannabis community that they are the kind of people you want to run these collectives.


-
 
 They are very involved in the community and have participated in every organized activity to support and enhance the community.


-
 
 When our neighborhood requested for them to have an open house, they held two.


-
 
 When the Planning Department first sent notices in May 2005 requiring a building permit for a change of use, they were the very first one to apply and by July filed all required documents.


-
 
 
They want very much to provide service to the community and are very committed to compassion.


-
 
 They provide cannabis to patients who are income limited and provide edibles to staff at Saint Mary's Hospital and Laguna Honda to be distributed to needy patients.


Juli Carter


-
 
 I have been a patient since 1995 and I have seen the evolution of the owners and the dispensary.


-
 
 They have not contributed to problems, if anything, they have helped.


Rev. Randi Webster


-
 
 
They are a very good addition to the medical cannabis community.


-
 
 They are very leveling, giving, and compassionate and I have not heard any problems from them.


Percy Coleman


-
 
 I have been a patient for about two years and I am here in support of the dispensary.


-
 
 I have never had any problems.
 
 This is one of the fewest areas where you can go in and leave without fear.


David Sarmento


-
 
 
I am here to support the dispensary.
 
 I have been a patient there since January 2006.


-
 
 
These are good fellows and they help and work for the community.
 
 Please approve the permit.


Shep Mishkin


-
 
 
I am a patient of this dispensary and they are very good people.


-
 
 
I am one of the patients that get free medical marijuana.


Ed Binion


-
 
 
I am here to urge you to grant the permit to this dispensary.


-
 
 They clean the streets and they patrol the streets.
 
 They keep the criminal element out and they are doing everything in San Francisco that a club should do to maintain their status.


Henry Singh


-
 
 
I am a single parent and patient of this dispensary.


-
 
 
They have provided me free marijuana for the last two years for my arthritis pain.


-
 
 
It is very convenient being a non-smoking place and a couple steps from the bus stop.


Amy McKee


-
 
 
I have been a patient of Good Fellows for over a year and I would like you give them the license to stay open.


-
 
 
This is the only club that I go to because I feel the safest there.
 
 They are good people.


Dave Flackman


I have been a patient for over a year.
 
 The people are very good and they keep the area clean 
Leslie Thomas


-
 
 I am requesting that Good Fellowes remain open.
 
 The relationship with the owners has been mainly as an advocate.


-
 
 I was the director of a patient union and the smoke shop was generous to our patient group.


 
 
 They are very good neighbors in between two not good ones.


Vergia Thompson


-
 
 I am a patient of this dispensary and they have given me free cannabis and I hope you will give the permission to keep their permit.


Robert Carltan


-
 
 
I also support giving the permit without the discretionary review.


-
 
 
I am also a witness of all the compassion that they have extended to all members.


Rodney


-
 
 The Federal Government should look into closing down all the medical marijuana clubs in the City.


-
 
 There are a lot of citizens that do not like going to the park and there are people smoking marijuana and there are people abusing the clubs just to get the pot.


-
 
 
You think about the moral value that you are trying to give to the city of San Francisco.


-
 
 I hope to see one of the members above me [the Commission] to start working with the Federal Government to close down the medical marijuana pot clubs.


James D'ahllagher, Attorney


-
 
 Unlike the other speakers, I am not a user and nor am I going to pontificate on how wonderful they are -- although they are.


-
 
 My purpose in coming is to respond to any possible arguments against the recommendation or for not granting this permit.


-
 
 So far, I heard one and I do not wish to dignify that one with a serious response.
 
 I think the people of California have spoken.


Heather Altree


-
 
 
I do not think that marijuana should be legalized that way.
 
 We are not prepared for this.


-
 
 If it is going to be legalized, there should be a lot of talk about situations on how it is going to be when they are on pot, since that makes them incapable of being normal and in control of them selves.


-
 
 They should not have license to give pot even if it is for medical reasons.
 
 It should go to the drug court.


 


Sarah Clarke, American Safe Access


-
 
 As the medical marijuana community grows in the community, it is becoming crucial that we continue supporting that community.


-
 
 If we do not allow these facilities to remain open, we are going to have less dispensaries and more patients and traffic going to the few dispensaries remaining.


-
 
 These regulations came up to legitimize and control these facilities.


-
 
 They are very compassionate and they are doing everything the City has requested.


Kevin Reed, The Green Cross


-
 
 I just want to show my support.
 
 They are give compassionate support and they are one of twelve dispensaries that have applied for their permit.


Laurence Odnner


-
 
 
I had a store adjacent to the Good Fellowes Shop and I am very familiar with them.


-
 
 I do not oppose the permit to operate there.
 
 However, I do wish to add the caveat that it should be with a conditional review.


-
 
 There is a volatile mix if we add the cannabis to that location.
 
 This facility sells pornography and dildos and crack pipes.


-
 
 Also, the hours of operation late in the evenings on the most dangerous blocks in the city without security are a concern.


Jeff Christen


-
 
 
I do not oppose the cannabis dispensary but it should have the discretionary review.


-
 
 This location sells all kind of pornography and crack pipes and people are selling the pot on the street.


-
 
 
I know many people spoke in favor of them but that is because they are getting free pot.


Mike McClarrinon


-
 
 
I oppose this medical cannabis dispensary in that are.
 
 It would increase criminal activity.


-
 
 On November 8 at approximately 7p.m., I asked the owner about tall cylinder devices on the shelf and the lady said it was a pipe glass to smoke ice.


 


ACTION:
 
 Took Discretionary Review and Approved as modified:


-Fixed the wall between the existing smoke shop and the medical cannabis dispensary that it goes up all the way up to the ceiling.


-Require that food stuff adhere to the City's template on labeling.


-Require secure gate to enter and exit the dispensary from and to the smoke shop.

- west side between Esmeralda Avenue and Virginia Avenue, Lot 5618 in Assessor's Block 020 - 
Request for Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit Application No. 2003.10.06.6599 proposing to construct a single-family dwelling on a vacant lot.
 
 The property is within an RH-1 (House, Single-family District), The Bernal Heights Special Use District, and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
 


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Do Not Take Discretionary Review and approve the project as proposed.


 


SPEAKERS


Charles Bolton, Discretionary Review Requestor


-
 
 The main issue is that we have extremely narrow streets there.
 
 The area in question has no legal walk way.


-
 
 We have concerns about the height because the two adjacent properties are much lower.


-
 
 The other issue is the parking situation because this would be the first driveway on the west side of the street and cars coming would not be able to recognize the driveway.


-
 
 We have a requirement for 2 off street parking spaces because parking is in tight demand in our neighborhood.


-
 
 We have strong concerns about the construction impact of the elevated driveway and the ramp.


-
 
 These issues were raised before the design review board over two years ago.
 
 After that, there were no discussions, negotiation or communications with the neighborhood.


-
 
 What we are asking is postponing any decision for two months to see if we can get to an agreement and if not, this Commission could make the decision.


Lee Moulton, Project Sponsor Representative


-
 
 There is support for the project from neighbors.
 
 We have made changes to address concerns of the adjacent neighbor.


-
 
 
This is a very difficult site on a down slope.


-
 
 This project is very modest â€“ a 3 story house over a basement, 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms and 3 off-street parking spaces.
 
 There is also a request for a variance for exposure on the street.


-
 
 It improves the public sidewalk in front of the house.
 
 It is not accessible because it ends at a dead end in front of two houses.


-
 
 The proposal includes reconfiguring the sidewalk by making it continuous and accessible.


-
 
 This has gone to the Department of Public Works and it has been approved.


-
 
 At the neighborhood meetings under the Northwest Bernal Height Review Board, there were recommendations to reduce the house by 12 inches and it has been done.


-
 
 8 feet has been cut from the top floor to reduce the mass of the building.


-
 
 There were two meetings with the design review board with Northwest Bernal Height and they have issued a letter approving the project recognizing the unique condition of the site.


-
 
 There have been two DPW public hearings and neighborhood meetings and Planning Department staff has recommended approving the project and not take DR.


David Kurn


-
 
 
My concerns are parking and traffic issues.


-
 
 The plans show a garage with one outside space and cars driving from the crest of the hill will not be able to see the driveway.


-
 
 
The parking variance should be denied because of the safety issues.


David Schreiber


-
 
 I am concerned about the parking.
 
 Look at the plan on Page S 1.1 showing that there would be one off-street parking and one on-street parking space.


-
 
 The street is so narrow that it would be difficult to enter or leave the house.
 
 Cars cresting the hill will not be able to see the driveway.


-
 
 Do not grant the variance and do not make a decision on the DR until they have time to review the traffic issues with an engineer.


Melissa Clendenny


-
 
 
This new house is substantially taller than the adjacent house and will impact light and air.


-
 
 
We are concerned with the ramp, sidewalk and drainage in front of our house (150 Ellis Street) eliminating the green space to replace it with concrete.


Mary Morgan


-
 
 I have three points to make: the driveway design is very dangerous. 
 
Place written conditions on it. 
 
Defer any decision until questions and concerns have been responded to and for you to physically look at the uniqueness of this street.


-
 
 Conditions need to be placed on the permit in writing because the project sponsor has not acted in good faith during this process.


Linda Goldman


-
 
 
Pedestrian safety on our block is very important to us.


-
 
 We are concerned about drivers entering the proposed driveway not being able to see the pedestrians because of the narrow street and the crest of the hill.


-
 
 We are very concerned that the proposed construction will jeopardize the safety of our family and neighbors because the sidewalk will be closed during construction.


-
 
 Every time that sponsor closes the sidewalk, pedestrians will be forced to walk on a narrow street over the blind hill.


-
 
 Urged the Commission to visit the site to fully appreciate all our concerns.


Sululagi Palegk


-
 
 
I think what they are proposing would be great if there were more space on that street.


-
 
 
The street is so narrow that even for fire fighters it is very difficult to get down the hill.


-
 
 In case of an emergency, I am very concerned about my mother-in-law if an ambulance is needed with that driveway reducing space there.


-
 
 
Urged the Commission to delay this process and request a different plan for that project.

 Took Discretionary Review and Approve requiring a model of the right of way prior to construction.

Request for a parking variance
.
 
 The proposal is to construct a house on a vacant lot that would be approximately 2,195 usable square feet, which would require two enclosed parking spaces per Planning Code Section 242(e)(4).
 
 One of the required parking spaces is proposed to be unenclosed.
 
 The property is within an RH-1 (House, Single-family District), The Bernal Heights Special Use District, and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.

I have been following this for the past one and a half years.


-
 
 
I am requesting you to look and be very carefully about this plan from the inception.


Robin Chiang

.


 


At the hearings, the Planning Commission will consider a rezoning and public improvements program to realize the vision articulated by the community through the Market and Octavia community planning process.
 
 For more information on this six-year planning process, please visit our website at
 
http://marketoctavia.betterneighborhoods.org
.


 


Specifically, the Commission will consider the following actions:


 


Ã‚Â·
 
 
Case 2003.0347E â€“ Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report
 
and 
adoption of CEQA Findings
 on the Market and Octavia Plan.
 


Ã‚Â·
 
 
Case 2003.0347M -
 
a proposed 
General Plan amendment
 that would add a new area plan, the Market and Octavia Area Plan, and make related amendments to the Commerce and Industry, Housing, Recreation and Open Space and Transportation Elements, the Civic Center Area Plan, Downtown Area Plan, South of Market Area Plan and the Land Use Index;
 


Ã‚Â·
 
 
Case 2003.0347T -
 
a proposed 
Planning Code text amendment
 that would revise Planning Code controls, including controls for land use, height and bulk, building design, loading, parking and new fees;


Ã‚Â·
 
 
Case 2003.0347Z -
 
a proposed 
Zoning Map amendment
 that would revise Maps 2 and 2H, 7 and 7H, and 2SU and 7SU.
 
 The proposed Planning Code text and map (Zoning Map) amendments would a) establish three new zoning districts, b) amend the Hayes-Gough, Upper Market, and Valencia Neighborhood Commercial Districts (NCDs), c) update height and bulk districts, d) establish the Market and Octavia Community Improvements Impact Fee, and e) make related revisions necessary to implement the General Plan.


 


Together, these four Commission actions are intended to implement the Market and Octavia Plan.
 
 Generally, these changes are described on page 3 of this document.


 


In addition, an historic survey is currently being done of the project area;
 
 property owners considering constructing
 
 or altering a building in this area should consult with Planning Department staff to determine
 
 the historic resource status of their property.
 
 Property owners and interested parties are advised that height limits and other controls do not provide unqualified rights to development, but rather, proscribe the maximum potential building envelope that may be permitted; proposed buildings may not reach the maximum permitted building height/envelope.
 


 


Members of the public may review a copy of the proposed amendments at the San Francisco Planning Department office at 1660 Mission Street 5
th
 Floor, San Francisco, CA 94103, at the Public Library (the Main Library 100 Larkin St., and Harvey Milk branch library, 1 Jose Sarria Ct. (near16

SPEAKERS ON THE TRANSPORTATION, STREETS AND OPEN SPACE PRESENTATION


Charles Marsteller


-
 
 I want to remind you about my previous testimony of possible soil compression issues along Market Street corridor.
 
 Densification could have an impact on the soil.


-
 
 We have transit impact development fees for commercial/industrial but not for residential.
 
 In areas for densification, we may want to expand the idea of the fee to improve public transportation systems.


Bernie Choden, San Francisco Tomorrow


-
 
 We funded the tear down of the freeway through a study that put out users of vehicles and where they are stored.


-
 
 Those are the only sensible studies that have ever been done for the last forty years and they need to be part of this plan.


-
 
 We have a problem with affordability within the central district.
 
 Fixing the neighborhood does not deal with the question of who pays for it.


Christopher Peterson


-
 
 The public transit improvement is absolutely crucial for this plan including bus route transit on Van Ness Avenue.
 
 It looks well on paper but we need to make it a reality.


-
 
 
The community benefit fee increases the chances to implement those improvements.


-
 
 I support the pedestrian improvements of the plan because it would enhance the accessibility to the downtown area to visit or live there.


Curt Holzinger,  Duboce Triangle Neighborhood Association


-
 
 We feel that we have two different neighborhoods.
 
 The one along Church and Market Street support the high density but in the inner neighborhood we do not support the new zoning.


-
 
 We are concerned about the new zoning because it would increase the units from 2 or 3 units per lot to up to 8 units.
 
 It is a huge up zoning impacting the open space and transportation.


William Bulkley, Hayes Valley Neighborhood Association


-
 
 With the higher density, we need more green space.
 
 The plan elements are a model for the City as a whole.


-
 
 
You are encouraged to do what you can to make this plan happen for the City.


Ed Bedard, Hayes Valley Neighborhood Association


-
 
 The car circulation through the Hayes Commercial District is a left over from the freeway traffic on Gough to Market and Franklin and Fell Streets.


-
 
 We support that the plan proposes to change Hayes Street to two-way all the way to Market Street.


Robin Levitt


-
 
 The plan really compliments the character of the Hayes Valley Neighborhood and works on things that make the neighborhood desirable with its diversity, many different housing types and a lot of potential to build.


-
 
 This district was a forgotten neighborhood with a lot of crime, central freeway and a lot of traffic.
 
 It has gotten better and this plan keeps the momentum.


Paul Olsen, President of the Hayes Valley Neighborhood Association


-
 
 We must make sure that the Market-Octavia Plan promotes the character of pedestrian orientation and to provide a choice to people that want to live in that type of neighborhood.


-
 
 
Transportation improvements are imperative and this plan has it, so let it go through.


James Haas


-
 
 I was dismayed that the Citizen Advisory Group for the Market-Octavia Plan turned down the request for money to request the traffic study that is very well needed for this plan.


-
 
 There is a high priority for bumps on Grove, Hayes and Franklin Streets because after concerts people bunch up on the streets.


-
 
 
The two-way Hayes Street is very interesting but seems to be infeasible.


Peter Cohen, Duboce Triangle Neighborhood Association


-
 
 We are concerned that there is no recognition of existing infrastructure and the impacts of a 33% increase of population that will have.


-
 
 We would like to see a clear delineation of how those improvements are going to happen in parts of our neighborhood.


-
 
 We have put together a list of specific things on transit and open space that should be done in this plan.


Tes Welborn


-
 
 
The plan is so well integrated with all the elements.


-
 
 There are some areas that still need to be addressed being the interface of traffic at Octavia with the MUNI lines, the entrance to the freeway and around Oak and Fell Street.


-
 
 We need more public spaces and there are few lots in the area that can be conceivable for community gardens and parks.


Sarah Karlinsky, San Francisco Planning and Urban Organizations


-
 
 
SPUR is supportive of the transportation element of this plan.


-
 
 We are disappointed that not all the transit and pedestrian improvements contemplated in the 2002 draft are being implemented with the plan.


-
 
 I urge you to learn more on the new metric that the Transit Authority is working on to use instead of Auto LOS [level of service]


Tom Radulovich, Executive Director of Livable City


-
 
 
The plan is good but there are weaknesses on some parts like the two-way Hayes Street.


-
 
 The analysis is not sensitive to provisions for parking in terms of the model for units.
 
 There is the tendency to use the quadrant policies.


-
 
 
I urge you to redouble your efforts to reform those policies.


Adam Millard


-
 
 
There is much housing for this plan but we need to incorporate traffic and transit improvements.


-
 
 
One of the most important elements is to convert Hayes Street to two-way.


-
 
 This is a great plan with great elements but we have to make sure that it is going to be implemented.


Karen Mauney


-
 
 I live on the corner of Oak and Laguna Street and about 40,000 cars pass by everyday and people are scared to walk.


-
 
 We are interested in the community benefits package and how that would work to make that actual plan implemented having safe streets to walk on.


 


 


Sue Hestor


-
 
 I have attended all the meetings on the Mission and South of Market and we do not have a comprehensive integrated transit plan.


-
 
 We are way behind on the transit improvements and without being able to ride on the buses people are not going to use the transit because of congestion.


Jason Henderson, Chair of the Transportation and Planning of Hayes Valley Neighborhood Association


-
 
 
The North of Market Street is impacted by massive volumes of traffic.


-
 
 Hayes Street was considered to be converted to two-way in the Market-Octavia Plan and now it is being studied.


-
 
 
We are very supportive of the 2002 draft version of this plan.


-
 
 
Do not dilute the plan based on Auto LOS [level of service] because we also need to include transit and bicyclist LOS.


 


SPEAKERS ON THE COMMUNITY IMPROVEMENTS/BENEFITS PRESENTATION


Tom Radulovich


-
 
 
We are very pleased that we are starting with this principle that growth should pay for growth.


-
 
 Please think about BART.
 
 When you are adding impact development fees, think about adding BART capacity and hopefully there should be a little expense.


-
 
 
Cars are the ones creating the impacts so they should pay the fees.


James Haas


-
 
 The MUNI stations on Van Ness and Civic Center are un-appealing for the Performing Arts patrons.
 
 They have not had any improvements since they were opened.
 
 There is no signage


-
 
 The proposal for the Van Ness station is too modest.
 
 It should involve a modernized station with a lot of information of activities in the downtown inviting people to use transit.


Jason Henderson, Hayes Valley Neighborhood Association


-
 
 This is really an important part of this plan and you should be very careful on how to rank it and the criteria to follow.


Tes Welborn


-
 
 This is very important for the plan and yet has the least public input.
 
 I would like to see a broader menu on benefits in California.


-
 
 South of Market, under the freeway, is going to increase noise and there was a lot of talk on improving this area.


-
 
 When the density bonus is ready for Van Ness Avenue, I would like to see it be used towards affordable housing and a community center with places for people to do things and not just sitting down on benches.


Peter Cohen, Duboce Triangle Neighborhood Association


-
 
 This is a relatively new framework since the 2002 draft plan and now we are thinking differently to really see how growth impacts the infrastructure.


-
 
 
The focus for our organization has been on how community needs are identified and analyzed.


-
 
 
We submitted to staff a list of summary of needs and we would like those to be addressed.


Robin Levitt


-
 
 It is very important to have this community benefit plan.
 
 As a property owner, one of the things that appealed to me is the bonus.


-
 
 Please consider the swimming pool for the community benefit.
 
 We do not have any in my neighborhood and a lot of children could benefit from it.


Alan Martinez, Castro Area Planning and Action


-
 
 
The nexus that determines the fees do not take into account the need of particular populations.


-
 
 Conditional Use process need to stay and be part of this plan to ensure that larger projects meet the values and needs of the community.


Sue Hestor


-
 
 
We have got to use this public benefit statement to sort out how you will deal with it.


-
 
 The Planning Commission should not move this without acknowledging that you have East SoMa, Mission, Showplace Square and Visitacion Valley, all coming through.


-
 
 
In the core area, you have 5 areas that are under going planning.


 


-
 
 
I just want to echo the needs of the community improvements and fees.


-
 
 There are three points:
 
 moving this plan forward, make sure that we have broader possible base for the fee, and direct staff to pursue some other resources as fast as possible.


Sarah Karlinsky, SPUR


-
 
 This is the first time a comprehensive plan for community benefit has been brought forward before you and it is exciting.


-
 
 One of the things that has not been mentioned and yet is important to keep in mind that the density and height proposed are part of what is going to pay for this community benefit package.

Commissioner Olague


-
 
 
We need to look at the advanced calendar because I think the calendars are burning people out.
 
 I do not know if other Commissioners agree.


-
 
 
I do not know if we should push the discussions out further or look at which can be moved to next year.
 
 We need to look at something.


-
 
 
I want to refer to what people mentioned about LOS and I would like to calendar an item for at least as informational to the Commissioners about LOS.


-
 
 
There was a resolution passed by Supervisor Mirkarimi, resolution 23306, urging the Planning Commission to update the transportation analysis under CEQA.
 
 It is rather lengthy.


-
 
 
I think a lot of people were referring to it when they were talking about Auto LOS this evening.


-
 
 
I think that before we even get to the place of directing the Environmental Review Officer to modify some of this, we need to better understand it.


-
 
 
I would like an informational hearing on LOS maybe in January or February.


Amit Ghosh, Chief Planner


-
 
 We suggested that there be other training sessions perhaps outside of the Commission hearings on methods that are used in environmental review analysis.


-
 
 It can be covered there if your calendar does not permit anything to happen in the near future.


Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 
I know it is late in the night but I could not help mentioning in regards to the 49ers situation.


-
 
 I talked often about architectural issues where the product is presented to us at the end of the process rather than us having some input in it.


-
 
 
It seems that this is a situation that a lot of planning is involved in the City's negotiations.


-
 
 I am wondering if it is the role of the Planning Commission to have more input as issues that involve parking and retail and access in City Planning for something that is being discussed but we are not part of the process.


-
 
 I would wish we could be involved in things like that at an early stage because we can contribute to it.


-
 
 We will be asked to make decisions on things that sometimes never get to us because we are not involved with it.


 


 


Amit Ghosh, Chief Planner


-
 
 We hear you and will be certain that if there is anything that transpires from any negotiation we will bring it for your consideration.


Commissioner W. Lee


-
 
 My suggestion is that Commissioner Olague and Commissioner Alexander sit down with Linda Avery and decide [about moving items on the calendar].
 
 That is your role.


Commissioner Olague


-
 
 Mr. Snyder requested that we hear item 15 next week and it will not take more than 5 minutes.


Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 I would rather have more sessions than being here at 11p.m. vs fewer sessions so as not to hold up the business before us.

PUBLIC COMMENT


 


At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items. 
 
With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.
 
 When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.
 
 Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.


 


The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.
 
 In response to public comment, the commission is limited to:


 


(1)
 
 responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or


(2)
 
 requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or


(3)
 
 directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.
 
 (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))


 


SPEAKERS


Sue Hestor


-
 
 One of your cases for next week disappeared.
 
 These are the letters saying that we are not withdrawing but telling you that you do not have to read the Capp Street stuff because we think we have an agreement.


-
 
 Second, I have been through a lot of Planning Commission [hearings] at the end of the year and the last weeks are horrible for everybody.


-
 
 Staff should be told to go light on you at the meetings at the end of the year.


-
 
 I was hearing the Board of Supervisor and there was an appeal about 2 lot subdivisions at Buena Vista Avenue, in a RH-2 neighborhood.


-
 
 The people were fighting the subdivision because the developer had been told by Planning Director Macris that they should be maximizing density on that project.


-
 
 I have heard that from too many developers.


-
 
 If the Director is telling that to developers, you should know about it.
