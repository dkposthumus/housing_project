55 Francisco Street Project
 
- 
Appeal of Preliminary Negative Declaration
.
 
 The project site at 55 Francisco Street (Assessor's Block 0056, Lot 006), also known as 1789 Montgomery Street, is approximately 48,714 square feet in size and located on the southern side of Francisco Street in the block bounded by Francisco, Montgomery, Chestnut, and Kearny Streets.
 
 The project site currently has a three-story, 284-space parking garage and a seven-story office building.
 
 The proposed project would involve the addition of three new levels atop the existing parking garage with 51 residential dwelling units (approximately 57,999 gross square feet).
 
 The existing office building on the project site would remain as it is.
 
 The proposed project would also involve reconfiguration of the existing parking by removing 81 independently accessible public parking spaces and creating valet parking for 203 vehicles on the first two levels of the garage, and providing 59 independently accessible parking spaces on the third level for the proposed dwelling units.
 
 The project site is zoned C-2 (Community Business), and is within a 65-X height and bulk district and Waterfront Special Use District #3.
 
 The proposed project would require Conditional Use authorization for the proposed Planned Unit Development (PUD).

President Sue Lee




I'd like to comment or make a suggestion to staff and to perspective project sponsors.


Three weeks ago we had a presentation by ICF Consulting on the changing demographics of the city.


It indicated we have a growing population that is not English speaking, that is foreign born and they are people who are interested in our process.


It is our obligation as a public agency to provide language assistance and notices and communications in various languages so they understand what's going on.


So when we have something like this [the continuance of item 15 with concerned neighbors that did not speak English or understand the process of continuing the item to another day] we can avoid situations like this.


I think that, particularly on a tenant site, which is a hot issue all over town, it is really important because people feel emotional about it and they take time away from their routines.
 
 It is a big deal for them to show up and to be told there is a continuance.


We need to do a better job communicating that.




Zoning Administrator Badiner responded




It is our practice to require the cell phone antenna companies to have an individual meeting in advance.
 
 That meeting is required to be noticed in multiple languages.
 


I think English, Chinese, and Spanish.


There is an ordinance that was put in place about a year and a half ago that requires all of our notices go out with an information sheet in multiple languages telling people how to contact us if they can't understand the notice and if they have questions.


We have people, multi-language speakers that call in and ask questions.


We are attempting to do that.


The past item [item 15] was continued at this point.


Even the English speakers would not have had notice of that.




Commissioner Bill Lee




It might be helpful if the Planning Department submitted a document to the Commission regarding access.
 
 Like accessibility.


Every Department under the ordinance requires every Department to have a written process in communicating with people with second languages.


Maybe you should send a copy to all the commissioners and that will add clarity to the areas with people who have a lack of speaking English that they have access to their own language.




Commissioner Hughes




I am curious, is there a requirement to submit a long-range plan for private property owners?




Zoning Administrator Badiner responded




Educational facilities and hospitals over a certain size have to have a Master Plan and update it on a regular basis.

 PUBLIC COMMENT


 


At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.
 
 With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.
 
 When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.
 
 Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.


 


The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.
 
 In response to public comment, the commission is limited to:


 


(1) Responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or


(2) Requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or


(3) Directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.
