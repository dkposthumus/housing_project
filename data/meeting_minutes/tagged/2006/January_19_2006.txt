Commission Comments/Questions




 


Commissioner Antonini:




Commented on amendments received on some proposed legislations from Supervisors, which is certainly something they are entitled to do.
 
 I think staff did a good job to inform us of the consequences of these actions.
 

I for one probably would never try to take an action quickly, without being able to carefully study an amendment.
 
 I think the procedure is a difficult thing to understand and learn on the run.
 
 And I think it is important when instances like this may occur in the future that I would certainly want to differ any kind of decision and find time to understand exactly what the consequences of the procedures would be in regard to items such as this.
 




Commissioner Olague:




Last week I requested some information on when we will be scheduling Trinity Plaza.


I have been receiving some calls from tenants in that area and the building.
 
 And they were wondering if we can given them a specific date in March, or some kind of timetable, because some of them would like to be here and they work and they would need a few weeks to request some time off.




Dean Macris – Director of Planning




I worked this morning with Paul Maltzer because that is one of the issues - getting our environmental document done and the development agreement, which is a companion document with this.
 
 We are giving that a high priority - to get this accomplished and give it to Commissioners as soon as we can.
 
 I want you to know that we are not delaying this in any way.
 
 We are moving as fast we can.
 
 I have taken a personal interest in this because we are talking about 2,000 housing units.
 
 That is a big contribution for the City's housing program.




Larry Badiner – Zoning Administrator




My sense is that probably it would be toward the end of February because schedules like this tend to slip and change.
 
 Staff and consultants need a little bit more time to do what they need to do.




Commissioner Hughes:




In past people have indicated that the fee structure for the Department is either very expensive to do business in San Francisco or not as expensive as other places.
 
 I wonder without obligating the Department too much, if there is any way we can get some comparisons and get some sense of where San Francisco is?




Dean Macris – Director of Planning:




I am glad you raised that question because if you recall, one of the administrative actions that you have taken it, and we been working on, is the reexamination of our complete fee structure.
 
 We now have the results of that information and we are combining it with the budget that we are be presenting in February.
 
 You will get a good deal of information about fees.
 
 And our proposed modifications and adjustments to fees are a part of our budget for next year.
 
 I think it has been scheduled some time in February.




Commissioner W. Lee:




Recently, I was able to receive a copy of 
Joint Venture Silicone Valley Network
, telling what they did as a non-profit group by using the 2005 index of Silicone Valley, which included Alameda County, San Mateo and Santa Clara and part of Contra Costa Counties.


This report that you can get on Venture at JointVenture.org.
 
 It is a report regarding the economics, which they tie into some bill and whether that reflects the fundamental long-range regional health, community concerns about housing.
 
 It took about three indicators looking into the health of the whole Silicone Valley area.
 
 Unfortunately, they left San Francisco out.


What I found out about the report is that they were able to get some data, which would be helpful to us in some ways, where the job growth only went up about 1% since 2000, but the net income for the average person went up 1%.


The reason I bring this up is because I think this is a good report and that could be helpful when we look at long term planning.
 
 And also when we will be talking about Eastern Neighborhood later today.
 
 There a lot of data in here that could be used by our staff.




Dean Macris – Director of Planning




Let me remind you that the Mayor's Office of Economic Development just engage in drafting an economic development plan, which has a goal to do a lot of what Commissioner Lee is talking about in the Silicone Valley situation.


I do not know when that process is going to be complete, but I think it is going to be very informative about the San Francisco economy.




Dean Macris – Director of Planning




Reminded the Commission that the Department is now in the process of scheduling a series of workshops.
 
 We are scheduled to have a workshop on housing next week.
 
 I just want to confirm that.


We are also scheduled to have the AIA present a series of workshops on Design Quality in San Francisco.

Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals




 


Larry Badiner – Board of Permit Appeal


1420 Haight Street
 – a case where the project sponsor had put in an addition for an elevator penthouse in the rear without proper permits - and also would require a variance.
 
 The Commission acted and denied that building permit.
 
 I, in my independent capacity as Zoning Administrator, disagreed with you.
 
 And that is very unusual.
 
 I granted the variance. The Board upheld the variance 4 –0.
 
 They overturned the Discretionary Review and approved the building permit 4 –0.
 
 Commissioner Albright was absent.


231 Ortega
 
– This is a project that you have seen many times, starting in 2003.
 
 It is a demolition permit.
 
 The Commission denied the application.
 
 Most recently it was before you with the adjacent property owner represented by Ms. Hestor and a Structural Engineer where we had a discussion about how much of the building could actually be safe.
 
 Staff recommended that the addition to the rear be reduce in length.
 
 The project sponsor did not want to do that.
 
 The Commission decision was that this was not retaining any thing in any real sense because the building had a side set back.
 
 The Board agreed with you in large park, but did decided to continue it for two months.


 


Dan Sider – Board of Supervisors




Supervisor McGoldrick's tree preservation ordinance passed on a second reading.
 
 Supervisors Elsbernd and Ma voted against.


Better Neighborhood Plus – amendments were made to this ordinance both by Supervisor McGoldrick in a more technical nature, and also by Supervisor Peskin.
 
 The amendments made by him [Peskin] really are more toward historic preservation and elevates the importance and significance of historical and cultural surveys in the ordinance.


The Landmarks Board, Planning Commission, and Board of Supervisors would now have to approve a cultural resource survey, before the plan itself could be adopted under the Better Neighborhood Plan.


Land Use Committee –




24
th
 Noe Valley Restaurant – an ordinance proposed by Supervisor Dufty to allow full service restaurants and limit full liquor license along 24
th
 Street.
 
 The Commission reviewed this on December 8 and approved it unanimously.
 
 The Land Use Committee agreed with the Commission and agreed to send it to the full Board.


-
 
 C-3 Parking – Supervisor Daly's ordinance is up for first action at the committee.

p
reliminary Recommendation: Pending


(Continued from Regular Meeting of December 15, 2006)


 


SPEAKERS:


John Sanger – Representing the Project Sponsor




Prior to engaging us, this project sponsor came to the Department with 104 market-rate condominium units for sale with 12% BMR units as required by section 315 of the Planning Code.
 


After several meetings and several versions of the plan over a period of about three months, they were told without any qualification by Planning staff that there would be no problem with those plans being approved.


That occurred in April, May, and June of 2003.


In July of 2003, the project sponsor acquired the property and within a month, submitted the site permit application reflecting the plans that had been presented to the Planning Department staff and approved for presentation.


Subsequently, based on a request for determination by two interested people in the city who had not been involved in any prior proceedings regarding the project, Mr. Badiner issued an interpretation rejecting the site permit application for 104 units on the grounds that it was too few units compared to that number that had been approved.


I will only say as I said they, that in 35 years of dealing with the Planning Department, I have never known a project sponsor that they could not build less that what had been approved.
 
 But we now have that precedent.


Subsequently, after many negotiations, we submitted revised plans because the project sponsor had acquired the site and could not wait forever to move forward.


We came forward with plans for 130 units, which were approved with 16 designated BMR units on site in December 2004.


I'm sorry, it was 2004 that all of this occurred in.
 
 Excuse me.


After the site permit was approved – and that is the last time under section 315 when a project sponsor can elect whether to build BMR units on site, provide them off site, or elect the in-lieu payment, Mr. Badiner ruled that the descriptive language describing the BMR units as rental in condition number 5 to the Conditional Use Authorization required "perhaps inadvertently" that they be for rent.


In my opinion this was a grossly unfair procedure.
 


I've never encountered anything like it in my dealings with the Planning Department - to have a project sponsor caught in this kind of bate and switch operation.


Since that time, we appealed Mr. Badiner's determination to the Board of Appeals.


Because the Board of Appeals expressed in strong opinion, though I believe it is contrary to the Planning Code, that this matter should come to the Planning Commission for consideration rather than to them, we are here today because the only decision maker available is either the Planning Commission or a court of law.


We have always – and certainly the project sponsor has tried to avoid litigation.


In this case, it hasn't been necessary yet.


Hopefully it will be possible to end it by having the necessary amendment made to the condition that will conform to two requirements of law.


One is section 315, which affords no discretion at the Planning Commission after years of imposing BMR requirements at its discretion, but provides all opportunities to all project sponsors the same.


The second is the Ellis Act, which states in simple terms that no governmental agency may compel any owner to rent any property whatsoever.


We believe both of these legal provisions make the condition void as it has been interpreted by the Zoning Administrator.


While we don't believe the Planning Commission should have had to deal with this, we are here because others thought so.

 Approved a motion of intent to approve with amendments.

CONSIDERATION OF A RESOLUTION OF INTENT TO INTIATE INTERIM
 
 CONTROLS FOR AREAS OF THE EASTERN NEIGHBORHOODS AND CENTRAL WATERFRONT
 
-
 
 Public hearing on a resolution proposing interim zoning controls that would establish Mixed-Use Residential, Employment and Business Development, and Urban Mixed-Use areas for sections of the Mission (generally bounded by Guerrero, Division, Potrero, and Cesar Chavez Streets), Showplace Square/Potrero Hill (generally bounded by 7
th
, Bryant, Potrero and 26
th
 Streets, and I-280), East SoMa (generally bounded by Mission, 7
th
, Harrison, 4
th
 and Townsend Streets, and the Embarcadero), and the Central Waterfront (generally bounded by Mariposa Street, I-280, Islais Creek, and the Bay).
 
 The Mixed-Use Residential area would support residential development; the Employment and Business Development area would support production, distribution and repair (PDR) activities, including digital-media; and the Urban Mixed-Use area would require limited amounts of PDR space associated with a wide array of other uses, including housing.
 
 The proposed interim controls would also establish overlay areas including, but not limited to: 1) a Design and Showroom district intended to support those activities in the Showplace Square area and 2) an Arts and Technology district intended to encourage activities interrelated with the California College of Arts and nearby development in Mission Bay. The interim zoning controls require the adoption of a resolution of intent to initiate that will enable the publication of a formal notice for a future public hearing on or after February 16
th
 at which hearing the Planning Commission would consider the adoption of interim controls.


Preliminary Recommendation: Approval of the Resolution of Intent


 


SPEAKERS


Gregg Miller, Attorney




We represent concerned owners of several properties in the area that are subject to the interim controls proposed today.


On behalf of those owners I ask to add grandfathering language that will allow existing and soon to be filed projects to proceed.


Also, I request the elimination of restrictive punitive requirements with respect to PDR demolition and replacement.


On a more specific note, I ask that you require block 418, lot 2 to be moved into the urban mixed-use zoning designation.


I think equity, fairness, progress and reality require such a clause to grandfather projects that have already applied or are in the process to file.


With respect to the PDR uses, the proposed controls prevented displacement or demolition of any existing PDR space unless that space could be replaced with one and a half times the amount of the prior space.


This requirement ineffectively prevents anyone from upgrading existing outmoded PDR space.




Steve Barrett, Harrison Gardens




We presented this project a few months ago and it proposed 551 units, 149 family units and over 66 BMR units [Below Market Rate].


I would like to talk against the biases against the larger scale housing projects.


We hope you adopt the grandfather clause to allow projects like ours to move forward during the interim control period.


We would like to see that you eliminate the bias against lot mergers.
 
 We would not be able to provide a pedestrian friendly environment.


There would need to be numerous curb cut outs and it would create a lot of confusion with already heavily traffic streets.


We would like to also see the eliminations of the super replacement of PDR.




Alison Poole, Project Manager for Harrison Gardens




I would like to mention some issues pertaining the freeway alley conditions and controls for the Eastern Neighborhoods.


Alleys adjacent to freeways provide a unique urban condition.


There should be exceptions for properties adjacent to freeway alleys to eliminate the mandatory walkways because they would not be used.


The alley near the Gardens of Harrison project would not have heavy pedestrian use because it would not lead to anywhere.


I also support the grandfather clause for these projects.




Curtis Eisenbezer, Mission Coalition for Economic Justice for Jobs




I am stunned as to the implications of what I have seen written.


A two and a half to one replacement of PDR for residential.


This would increase the cost of housing because parking would need to be construct under ground and that is very expensive.


A particular case:
 
 the Wonder bread factory immediately adjacent to the Potrero Shopping Center.


Intercontinental bakery went bankrupt and put the building on sell.
 
 And the best of all was U-Haul.


You want business and employment in this area and we need to work on that.


There is a need for an increased amount of work.
 
 Get these interim controls to something that is really going to work for the City.




Bob Meyers, Planning Consultant for Harrison Gardens




I would like to address Appendix C, page 8 for Mixed-use Residential Districts.
 
 In this section, staff presents design guidelines and controls.
 
 I am here to support design guidelines.


We oppose the controls with its words like "shall," "shall not" or "prohibit."


The controls say that driveways and curb cuts shall not exceed a certain width.
 
 This should be discouraged and not "shall not."
 
 That is typically decided by DPT in a project that goes through a very extensive transportation study


These should become guidelines and be part of the design review of each individual project.


I request that you remove all the controls with their word  shall not' for the East SOMA and include guidelines.


We support a grandfather clause.




Debra Stein, Attorney for Harrison Gardens




We know these projects need to move forward and the interim controls is going to stop them.
 
 Even Eastern Neighborhoods would take a long time to develop.


The new interim controls are including substantial new housing policies even though no new nexus study has been done.


Imposing these new unsupportive housing policies is not consistent with the Commission's determination that we need a comprehensive economic analysis.


I urge you to sustain the existent housing policies until a new economic and comprehensive analysis can be adopted.


If we are going to have new housing policies, it needs to become sensitive and legally defensible.




Judith Berkoniz


-
 
 The Mission certainly does not need more self-storage.


Chris Durazo




I would like to have more outreach to the community through posting notices on the streets.


It would be powerful to have somebody, either a Commissioner or staff, inform the communities about the process that is going to take place with the eight hearings.




Fred Snyder




It has been six years with the interim controls.
 
 The effect is going to be wonderful with the employment.


We should have this moving forward.


I request that 550 Florida Street be removed from the mix-use residential.


I would like to know how much money has been spent during these six years by the Planning Department to do what they have done until this point.




Tony Kelly




We worked for a long time on community based planning at the Central Waterfront.


It is sad that these interim controls are going forward before even going back to the community.


You have a lot of new concepts that have not been studied by a nexus analysis.


I understand that developers and the community are pushing to move this forward.


This is not the right time to rush through this process and make a mistake on these controls that have not been studied.




Brett Gladstone




Speaking on behalf of Mission Preservation Partners, the owner of the Mission Armory that is proposed to have 173 dwelling units.


I am requesting the Commission to ask staff to look into the requirement of one square foot PDR for five square feet of residential.


Brokers have been out there marketing the Armory for thirty years.
 
 Mini markets for PDR users that have no takers.
 
 That is a problem.


The community is proposing to us community space between 10 and 30 thousand square feet.


The point is that under this new zoning the only use of that size other than residential can be PDR.


Also, why is there not an exception for landmarked buildings?
 
 Why is there not a grandfather provision for pipeline projects?


We can understand the encouragement of 2 to 3 bedroom units all being BMR units and that may work for large brand new projects on empty land.


That would probably not work economically for an expensive rehabilitation to a building that is a city landmark that has failed to be developed for so many years.


Now, I am changing hats to speak on behalf of six developers in the Mission and the Eastern Neighborhoods.


I am really surprised that staff has proposed another change of the FAR CM district from nine to one.




Michael Burk




I am here representing Lion Enterprises who owns the Lion's building at 16
th
 and Florida Street as well as a lot across Florida Street.


I could show you the location on these photographs.
 
 As you can see there is a lot of housing on Bryant Street.


The property is located just to the West of Bryant and 16
th
 Street with residential above double.


The pitch here is that these properties should be urban and residential mixed-use development.




Roberto




Urged the Commission to not adopt the interim controls and instead to follow guidelines and policies.


Interim controls would stop development when market conditions really permit them to go forward.


There are multiple opportunities for the production of housing with the Eastern Neighborhood rezoning, including affordable housing.




Sarah, 3400 Cesar Chavez Project




I understand that you received a letter from Steve Vettel from our office addressing our main concerns regarding the interim controls.


We look forward to working with this Commission and staff over the next few weeks to address those concerns.




Steve




I would like to speak about the grandfathering proposition.


Our client filed last year for an environmental evaluation, conditional uses and zoning re-classification.
 
 Thousands of dollars were needed to file these documents.


Regarding the lot mergers:
 
 there are very unusual shaped lots in the city and it would be hard to build anything on them.


The alley guideline is an unusual condition for our block on 3
rd
 and Harrison Street.
 
 The alley there is 200 feet to the next alley with no building in between.


Some of these things need to be put together with the planning documentation to really create better projects that helps to produce more housing.




Joe




I have some reservations about interim controls but I have a greater concern that we continue to not get the planning completed.


I encourage the interim controls.

- south side between Buchanan and Webster Streets; Lot 001, in Assessor's Block 0517 - 
Request for Conditional Use authorization
 under Planning Code Sections 157, 204.5, 209.7 and 303 to legalize the operation of the existing motel parking lot (for the Motel Capri) as a public automobile parking lot (available to the public at times when such parking is not needed to serve the use for which it is primarily intended).
 
 The site is within a Residential Mixed, Moderate Density (RM-2) and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
 


P
reliminary Recommendation: Approval with Co
nditions


 


SPEAKERS


William Choper, Project Sponsor's Attorney




This parking operation has existed for many years.


The former manager of the property was renting out the spaces on a monthly basis to people who work on Union Street and that practice has continued to the present.


There are 10 spaces used for that purpose.


I am a little troubled with the condition proposed that they cannot let out any more spaces than they have vacant rooms.


We have two people renting for only two days per week during business hours and these people do not disturb our guests from using the parking lot.


If the parking lot is crowed with customers, the monthly parkers cannot park there.


We have never received a complaint of loudness from neighbors.


Requested that the Commission delete that condition.




Kim Fraser




I am one of the neighbors most affected because I live directly across the street from the motel.


The motel conditional approval appears to be disallowed by amendments to the planning code following its construction.
 
 I would like that to be investigated.


I do not see how you can permit an intensification of an activity on a non-conforming use that would have a negative impact on neighbors.


The parking lot is not necessary because there are nearby public garages.


At least 15 to 20 spaces are used throughout the day by non-motel customers and that many again at night.


I urge that you deny this request so as to preserve and protect our neighborhood.




Patricia Vaughey




I have been watching this motel as well as others in the area doing something similar.


The majority of the people who lease those parking spaces during the day are from Hilling Company and Coldwell Banker.
 
 There are about ten to eleven people.


One of the problems in the Marina Cow Hollow is the lack of city planning.


We have 8,754 bar/restaurant seats, 700 businesses, 2800 workers and only 1300 spaces in 9 parking places.


There is not enough for the neighbors or for the merchants in the area.


I do not have a solution to this but I do not have a complaint about Capri.


We do have a problem late at night with the bar.




Joanie




This is an intensification of the use.
 
 We are a transit city and you can never fulfill the desire for parking.


There are so many ways to deal with this.


People that take their car at two in the morning are very loud.


This is a quality of life issue and I do not see the reason to support it.




John Kelly




I used to work at the Capri Motel as a night clerk and because of my actions the motel had to come to this Planning Commission for a conditional use application.


They have been operated this parking that way for many years.
 
 Only before, they were doing it illegally.
 
 Just recently they paid taxes for that use of the lot.


I am not sure that the Motel Capri's situation is similar to other parts of the city.




Barbara




I request that you deny the conditional use.


There was no outreach to the neighbors regarding this matter.


A public parking lot is not appropriate for this residential neighborhood.


There are also parking spaces available in the area.




 


ACTION:
 
 Approved as revised by staff and amended:


- The number of spaces allotted it at any time for a commercial use should not exceed the vacant rooms on the property.


-
 
 A commercial user could occupy a parking space if the guest has checked out and the housekeeper is preparing the room.

SPEAKERS


Barbara


-
 
 I am a business owner and resident of the area.




The issue is the number of liquor stores in the area.
 
 There are five liquor stores within two blocks and that's not mentioning others in the area.


This does not enhance what we offer as a community.


I urge you not to approve this.




[No name]




Don't continue the item.




Rachel Larson




I live in the neighborhood and am very much against having another liquor store between Post and Clay on Franklin Street.


It would not make an ideal addition to the neighborhood, nor is it beneficial to the neighborhood.




John Kelly




This application is the only reason that I am here.


I would like to know if the project is continued whether I would have a chance to speak then?


I strongly oppose this application because we have more than enough liquor stores in our city.
 
 [Showed a map of liquor stores in the area]


Supervisor Maxwell is seeking a moratorium on liquor stores in her district.
 
 Also, I heard that Supervisor Daly is considering a moratorium in the Tenderloin.


These moratoriums are being considered for a reason.

SPEAKERS


Paul Targel, 1
st
 Discretionary Review Requestor




I live with my wife in a house on Oak Street that backs up against the project applicant's property.


The proposed project would change the architectural historic character of this neighborhood.


It would affect the light, air and ventilation of my property.


We receive only a little right now.


The penthouse deck would be at the same level of our bedroom - impacting our privacy.


That deck would be a nuisance because I understand it is going to be for recreational purposes.


Please, I strongly suggest that you disapprove this project.




Ashley Allen, 2
nd
 Discretionary Review Requestor




I am the immediate neighbor.


There are four points of concerns regarding this project: privacy, potential safety hazard, copycat behavior by other neighbors, and diminishing property value.


The deck would be at bedroom level and I assume that their activities would include smoking and drinking, bringing the potential of safety hazards.


The copycat behavior is that the Planning Department has approved recently a vertical addition only two properties down the street and now everybody wants to do the same thing.




Mark Sammerfield, Project Sponsor and Owner




I want to construct a 230 square foot deck on the second floor of my home.


It is primarily for my own use.
 
 I am single and do not smoke.


I went to the Building Department and asked how I could design something with minimum impact on my neighbors.


It is an improvement to the house and is within the codes.




Steven




I generally support my neighbors but this project would have a big impact on our properties.


This boxy construction would impact light, air, privacy and the obstruction of the view would diminish the value of my property.

One week ago I testified on agenda item 18.


We only had one minute and I could not finish my comments and request to you.


Basically, I wanted to ask you for the deadline to be extended for submitting comments for the draft EIR on the Marina project.


If this is possible, let me tell you my efforts to get the information.


I asked for copies of the documentation submitted by the project sponsor at the Department because of an extension of the deadline for three months and nothing was submitted to the file.


The gentleman from Rec and Park had some documents in his hands.


I checked out the Planning Department – Ms. Gibson – and there was nothing from Recreation and Park.


So we absolutely need more time to review what was submitted by Recreation and Park Department.


I raised this issue at the Rec and Park Commission Regular meeting.
 
 I asked under the Sunshine Ordinance and they didn't answer yet.


So, I would like an extension for submitting public comments on the draft EIR.
