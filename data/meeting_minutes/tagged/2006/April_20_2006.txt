333 Fremont Street
 
- 
Motion to Approve In-Kind Agreement to Satisfy Rincon Hill Community Infrastructure Impact Fee Requirement per Section 318.3(e
). The Planning Commission approved a project at 333 Fremont Street on June 16, 2005, that includes approximately 88 dwelling units. Planning Code Section 318.3(b)(i) requires payment of $11.00 per net occupiable square foot of residential development for the Rincon Hill Community Infrastructure Fund prior to issuance of site permit. The project would require a payment of approximately $800,000. The project sponsor has entered into an In-Kind Agreement with the City, to the satisfaction of the Planning Department and City Attorney, to provide physical public improvements, equal to a portion of the value owed by the sponsor, and described in the Planning Code 318.6 and in the Rincon Hill Plan. The Sponsor will pay the balance of the fee obligation.

COMMISSIONERS’ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
<<Project End>>

 Commission Comments/Questions


 


Commissioner Antonini:




We had discussion regarding 
illegal signs
 in the last few weeks.
 
 Apparently three is an instance where there is an illegal sign.
 
 The owner of the building is not allowed to engage in a lease or rental of that building until this issue is resolved.
 
 I want a little clarification on what the policy is because it would seem to me that there are mechanisms in place to try to remedy this as part of the arrangement that was approved.
 
 In the case of signs that are illegal, one would think the first remedy would be a fine or some sort of assessment that either the sign company or the property owner instead of having a situation where a renter might be deprived the ability to rent the space as a result of the illegal sign.


The second item is with regard to the 
Rincon Hill Improvement Fund
.
 
 When it came before us I think the Commission was pretty clear on the fact that the first dollars were to be spend in terms of capital improvements for the Rincon Hill Area proper.
 
 Then going on from there, monies would be spent throughout the city or for the area South of Market in general.
 
 As I recall there were findings by the Commission.
 
 I don’t really know exactly how this is being taken up once it’s gone through the Supervisors—what the priority there is on this fund.
 
 I’d like to learn about this.

 Director’s Announcements

Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals




 


Board of Supervisors (reported by Dan Sider of Department staff):




On Tuesday, the full Board (on a 9 to zero vote with Supervisor’s Alioto-Pier and McGoldrick absent) did a resolution urging the Environmental Review Officer to revisit the metric, which the Environmental Review staff uses to measure traffic impact.
 
 Currently loss of levels of service is the gold standard metric for measuring traffic impact.
 
 There have been concerns raised that loss does not adequately address bicycle trips and pedestrian trips and transit trips.
 
 Supervisor Mirkarimi through this resolution has requested that we work with his office to develop a new metric, which would be more suitable to our transit-first city.


On Wednesday, at the Land Use and Economic Development Committee the Redevelopment Plan and the General Plan amendments associated with the Bayview Hunters Point Redevelopment Plan were recommended for adoption at the full Board.
 
 There was a lengthy hearing and some amendments were made.
 
 The Board is expected to review these matters as early as May 9
th
.


A final note:
 
 The Mayor did introduce a resolution on Tuesday that would authorize the Department to enter into a new lease agreement at 1650 Mission Street, next door to our current offices, to house the entire department under one roof.
 
 We are very excited about that possibility.




 


Zoning Administrator Badiner responded to Commissioner Antonini’s concerns:




The case you are talking about has to do with a restaurant that is seeking a permit to start creating a restaurant; to make out a permit to do the tenant improvements for a restaurant in the downtown area which would normally be easily approvable—almost an over the counter kind of thing.
 
 However, we have a complaint that there is an illegal general advertising sign.
 
 [Planning Code] Section 175, subsection C says that no permit shall be granted, approved or issued by any city department where the lot on which the structure is or will be maintained has created contrary to the provisions in this code.
 
 The long and short of it is if there is a violation on the property, we can’t approve another permit on it.
 
 There are some exceptions that we generally allow – if there is a roof leaking we would allow the roof to be repaired for safety and stuff.
 
 I have been working closely with the specifics of this case to figure out as best as possible if we can determine whether this general advertising sign is legal.
 
 I received an email this morning confirming from the public’s point of view that this was a new sign.
 
 I do have a permit that shows there was a sign permitted in this location from either ’67 or ’57.
 
 But then the question becomes has it been continuously maintained as a sign.


·
        
 
The Code is the law and we love it.
 
 This really is not the restaurant’s fault.
 
 They have nothing to do with this.
 
 But it is one of the tools we have to say to a property owner that one of your lessees is in violation and is affecting another lessee.
 
 And you as the property owner need to help us get them into compliance.
 
 Otherwise frankly what does a general advertising company based out of state care whether we think they’re illegal or not?
 
 They’ll drag it out as long as they can so they can get their rent.
 
 It’s only going to start damaging another tenant.
 
 Unfortunately that is the hammer that we have now.
 
 We don’t have the fines right now.




 


Board of Appeals (reported by Zoning Administrator Badiner)




578 to 592 Jersey Street.
 
 We denied the request fro use of vinyl windows in this case.
 
 The Board of Appeals upheld our decision.
 
 It went to court.
 
 The court overturned the Board of Appeals upholding our decision.
 
 The Board of Appeals vacated their decision last night.
 
 I do not know the details but I will get that and provide copies or report back.

Sarah - DR Requestor




I live at 1630 Lake Street.
 
 I am directly east of the subject property


The corner lot they keep referring to as vacant lots, they’re people’s yards.


Not my yard.


The three lots have been combined in one yard and three center homes that you can see are detached.


Except for a couple bay windows and a small front porch, they are not built to the property line


The subject project is proposing building 19 –1/2 feet out onto the property line to the west.
 
 Basically abutting this vacant lot which is somebody’s yard


My deck, which I eat 99 out of 100 meals with my family of four plus a very big dog will be cast in the shadow form this house.
 
 This basically affects my kitchen and eating area, which is kind of the center of the family home.


I bought my house in 2000 and have put about $350,000 into it, all within the footprint because I respected the precedent that was set [of no one expanding beyond the existing footprint].




Jason Thomas – Project Owner




We agree, we think it is a wonderful neighborhood.


Our home was built in 1913.
 
 We think there are a lot of wonderful elements to the house, and yet it does not reflect the realities of modern living.


Our project is really just an expansion of a current, very small breakfast nook to provide some flow through between the kitchen and the living room, some out door space, and a bedroom beneath it for our family.


I wanted to comply with the design guidelines and we chose an architect we thought was very thoughtful and who would design something that fit with the character of the neighborhood.




David Gast - Project Architect

Shannon Engle Brecht – Project Owner




We love Bernal Heights and are a small family of four that wants our Bernal Home


The building we are talking about is a 97-year old home that has no historical significance.


It has foundation failure, wet rot, dry rot, extreme mold and mill due damage, and most of the supporting studs are heavily damaged.


No family can be healthy and safe in that house.


It is going to be much more energy efficient to deconstruct and salvage what we can for building the new house, which is what we prefer to do.


We want to build a couple of modest unique family homes that will still be a healthy part of the neighborhood in 80 or 100 years.


We want to be part of the precedence that the San Francisco Department of the Environment has tried to set for building modest green homes in San Francisco.


We are committed to doing rainwater collection for our landscaping, using reuse wherever possible, reuse of materials, using solar harvesting for our electricity, and using structured insulated panels because that reduces the environmental damage during the building process.


The Department of the Environment gave us a letter of endorsement that our building qualifies as green.


We’ve worked with the Design Review Board and addressed not just any variances with the code they found where we were a little off, but also just with neighbor’s preferences.


I think it would be kind of sad to derail the project that is such a positive part of where San Francisco is going.




Carol




I’ve lived in Bernal for quite a while.


I’m one of the people that are in the other family who are going to be in the second house, we hope.




Toby Long – project architect




From the view of creating exciting energy efficient model for housing for San Francisco moving forward and more specifically Bernal moving forward, we are very excited about the direction this project is taking and look forward to moving to the next steps.




Terry Milne – Member of the East Slope Bernal Heights Design Review Board




We endorse this project.
 
 In general we thought this was a good project for Bernal Heights.
 
 They actually listened and responded to the neighbors.


Our Review Board is not usually in the habit of endorsing demolitions of existing homes because usually there is an opportunity for reuse.


In this case, this house has been sort of a neighborhood burden over the years with illegal additions that happened at various times.
 
 The best answer would be to demolish it and put up these two new modest homes.




Brian O’Sullivan – Project Owner




My wife and I are very interested in living in the neighborhood.
 
 And I would be very excited to be able to take part in the life of the neighborhood.




Robert Pender




I think it’s a good project

715-719 and 721 Market Street
 
- south side between 3rd and 4th Streets, Lots 063 and 064 in Assessor’s Block 3706 - 
Request under Planning Code Section 309 for Determinations of Compliance and Request for an Exception to the rear yard requirement
 as permitted in Code Section 134(d), for the creation of five additional dwelling units, two on the roof of the 715-719 Market Street building, and three within the existing envelope of the 721 Market St. building.
 
 The site contains two existing adjacent buildings, one with 7 stories and one with 2 stories, that were approved by the Commission on May 5, 2005 (Case No. 2004.1431ECVX) for conversion from office to a mix of uses including up to 45 dwelling units, up to 45 parking spaces, three ground floor retail spaces totaling approximately 4,000 sq.ft. and approximately 5,300 sq.ft. of office space in the basement and on the ground floor.
 
 One of the proposed additional dwelling units would be located within the Code-required rear yard area.
 
 The project will be the subject of a concurrent variance hearing before the Zoning Administrator because two of the five additional units would not have Code-required dwelling unit exposure.
 
 The subject property is in a C-3-R (Downtown, Retail) Zoning District and a 120-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions
