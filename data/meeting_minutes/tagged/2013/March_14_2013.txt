Commissioner Antonini:


I have two or three items. First of all, congratulations to Bevan Dufty and others that worked with the encampment under I-280 and unlike other situations, where the encampment was nearly removed, they did provide housing and services to those that were living there and I understand they had a good response almost all that were involved have been helped, and the other important item of this was that there is not an ability to return. So that, I think maybe a way to come up with a policy that may have some benefit for us in the future citywide. Secondly, I was happy to be part of the Housing Forum yesterday as was Sophie Hayward, she was present, and it was a very good hearing. We had a representative from almost every post secondary institution in San Francisco. I can only think of one that wasn’t there that I know of, may have been a couple. It was a good round table and it really dealt with the issue of student housing and the new legislation and hopefully a lot of these groups will partner with each other and be able to provide housing for their students and I think it's very encouraging. And thirdly, if I could ask for some help, it's coming up on the screen. Great. We have a new Pope, but we also have other new editions.  Because as you know the Pope is the first Jesuit and also the first Pope from the Americas and this is my first grandson who was born last week and appropriately, his name is Primo which means the first in Italian. So his name was very timely. Thank you. 


 


C.         DIRECTOR’S REPORT


 


5.         Director’s Announcements


            


DIRECTOR RAHAIM
:


I just wanted to briefly report, you will hear from a AnMarie in more detail. As I think you probably know, the Board of Supervisors this week upheld the Environmental Impact Report for CPMC and approved a new term sheet and I just wanted to let you know, because of the nature of the changes in the project you will be seeing this project again.  We are looking to bring you the initiation, the General Plan and Code changes in late April, we have tentatively scheduled a hearing on May 13
th
,  for to you take action on the new Conditional Use, Code changes and the General Plan Amendments and from then it will go to the Land Use Committee, to the Board in June, and to the full Board in late June or early July. That is the tentative schedule at this point. We will be getting you a large packet of information at least three weeks in advance because of the requirement for initiation. To initiate three weeks in advance of any General Plan action. You should be seeing that in about a month from now.

Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.


 


LAND USE COMMITTEE: 




The 
LU Committee considered a package of technical amendments to the Planning Code that included clarifications and corrections.  This Commission recommended approval on November 29.  Since that time, a few other non-substantive changes were identified and incorporated into the ordinance.  This included such items as adding a note to the public about where current indexed fees could be found, deleting some proposed new text to ensure that moving signs are not allowed in Union Square and deleting the Lower Haight St. Tobacco Paraphernalia RUD which has subsequently expired. Newly appointed Supervisor Katy Tang, representing the Sunset district expressed her interest in an accurate and complete Planning Code and signed on as the legislative sponsor. 
With those amendments, the Committee recommended approval of this Ordinance.
 




.




 




FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: 




On Tuesday the Board of Supervisors adopted the Western SoMa Plan and its associated elements at its first ready by a 10 to 1 vote
[1]
. This milestone moment for the plan was made possible by the years of community and City effort.  The Board hearing contained a robust discussion of the plan’s components but no amendments were proposed.  At the hearing Supervisor Wiener expressed concerns that the Plan included too many limitations on entertainment and office uses. Supervisor Breed also expressed similar concerns. However, Supervisor Kim and several other supervisors noted that the Plan struck a balance between many competing uses like entertainment, office, and housing. She and Planning Department staff explained that the SALI district is intended to essentially be a PDR district, and as such, should not permit housing and office uses. There was discussion of the grandfathering provision for the Conditional Use Authorization process for the Academy of Art University's facility at 601 Brannan Street. Board President Chiu and several other supervisors expressed general concerns, but no amendment was offered to remove the grandfathering provision. The Plan will have its second reading next Tuesday, March 12th. 




In review, since the Planning Commission adopted its recommendations for the Plan in December, the Board of Supervisors has made the following amendments:


§
  
Removal of "B" bulk designations throughout the plan area


§
  
Rezoning most proposed RED properties fronting major streets to RED-MX


§
  
Rezoning the "Rawhide" and "Sightglass" properties on 7th Street from Folsom St NCT to WMUG


§
  
Removing the grandfathering provision for the "Purple Building" residential development on 11th Street due to a negotiated agreement between the property owner and the entertainment community


§
  
Adding a grandfathering provision for the AAU CU for 601 Brannan St


§
  
Allowing lot mergers in WMUO that create a property with up to 200 feet of frontage on a single street (instead of up to 100 feet)


§
  
Increasing the residential impact fees for "Major Developments" from Tier 1 to Tier 2.


·
         
Planning Department Budget Supplemental.  


§
  
10 positions requested, 8 approved


§
  
3.2 million req, 2.8 million approved


§
  
The two cut positions were Planner iii in current planning & a Clerk in citywide were cut.


·
         
CPMC.  Summary – Term Sheet Endorsement 


On Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors endorsed the Term Sheet for the California Pacific Medical Center Hospital Rebuild Project.  As you know, this Commission approved the CPMC Development Agreement on April 26 last year.  The Term Sheet endorsed by the Board differs in the following ways from that Development Agreement.  


§
  
Permits a smaller Cathedral Hill Hospital (274 beds from 555 beds) and larger St. Luke’s Hospital (120 beds from 80 beds)


§
  
CPMC is obligated to provide specific levels of charity care with no reference to CPMC’s financial conditions


§
  
About $80 million in cash for community benefits related to healthcare, transportation, workforce training, affordable housing, and pedestrian safety


At Tuesday’s hearing, Supervisors Breed, Avalos and Cohen requested that moving forward staff work with CPMC to refine the workforce program, specifically the timing of payments to support workforce training, use of local contractors for construction, and commitment to employing San Franciscans in end-use jobs.  Board President Chiu recommended that OEWD create a workforce working group to address these terms in the Development Agreement.  Supervisors Breed and Wiener voiced concern that the Term Sheet eliminated funding for workforce housing and the Down payment Assistance Loan Fund (DALP), and Supervisor Kim requested additional information about providing psychiatric care throughout the City.  


In terms of the process moving forward, the revised Development Agreement and associated approvals will return to this Commission in May before returning to the Board of Supervisors in June and July.  




·
         
CPMC EIR. 
 As far as the EIR Appeal (which was handled quickly), the Board unanimously voted to uphold the Certification.  Before the vote, President Chiu asked staff to speak.  We explained that the revised CPMC project is covered by the EIR. The March 5th memorandum explains that although a somewhat different proposal than the Previous CPMC Alternative 3A, the environmental impacts of the Revised Project fall within the scope of the EIR’s analysis of the Previous Project and Alternative 3A. The significant and unavoidable impacts identified for the Previous Project and Alternative 3A would continue to be significant and unavoidable under the Revised Project; however some of these impacts would be somewhat reduced, and there would be no new significant impacts. Thus, the EIR contains an adequate analysis of the environmental impacts of the Revised Project, pursuant to the requirements of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines and the City’s administrative code.

At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes. 


 


The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public comment, the commission is limited to: 


 


(1)  responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or


(2)  requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or 


(3)
   
directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.  (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))
