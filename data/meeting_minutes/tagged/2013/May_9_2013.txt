Commissioner Antonini:


I have a couple things. First of all, I wanted to report the Secretary Search Subcommittee continues to meet and is making good progress. We will be meeting again in a couple of weeks and ultimately, once we get down to the selection process, the entire Commission will be involved obviously in that, but we are doing well on that, I believe. A couple of other things -- is this on, can you hear me now? Sorry.  I went to the Friends of City Planning event last night. I want to thank them; they always have a wonderful event. And there was a lot of, a huge attendance and a lot of jubilation as it should with the things that are going on in the City as far as we're seeing projects that were approved over a period of 10 years finally getting built, both housing and commercial, and a lot of interest in San Francisco, both for residential and for business. But we have problems, as you're all aware, and I think we can't get too self-congratulatory while things still exist, and I've spoken often about homelessness and street people and the fact that we're not meeting their needs and it's not helping our residents or tourists or visitors to our City on that issue. And also there was a very good article in the Examiner on, yesterday. It talks about people under the stairs and basically focuses on the Excelsior District in particular, where most of the homes are single-family residences, but there are a lot more than single families living in these homes and there are probably a lot of illegal units, perhaps many with kitchens and are certainly overcrowding situations. One of the reasons we see all the fires that have occurred and other issues sometimes where there are limits to the number of non-related people that can live in a residence, I think, and other things. And one of the article -- part of the article mentioned that they do have some periodic inspections, but if nobody's home they just pass it over. I would like to see a little more organized plan to inspect even single-family homes. I'm fine with that. I live in a single-family home. I have no problem with somebody coming by and making sure it's in compliance because many of the problems that we have in these areas, such as home prices going up astronomically, parking problems have their origin in the fact a lot more people are living in these structures than they're designed to hold. And many times the owners are not even present there. They're just renting it out to -- making it into a quasi-hotel and it's supposed to be a single-family home. So, I think we need to do some work on that. And finally, there was an article in The Chronicle on Saturday, and I was mentioned as part of the article had to do with the graffiti problem with particular reference to these stores that are operating at night and weekends and selling graffiti to graffiti vandals. I worked with staff a little bit to try to find out if there's ways we can close them down or at least restrict their operations. One of them may be formula retail, so that is one thing we are looking at because obviously none of them came before us for approval in that regard. I also I am going to either propose some legislation on my own through the Commission, of course. I found out how that can be done, or approach one of the members of the Board of Supervisors to look into a restriction on the sales of spray cans. We're all about the environment. We're always banning plastic bags and everything else and nothing can be more polluting than spray paint, especially being used for vandalism. So, you know that might be something that some supervisors would be interested in. And also I understand the penalties for graffiti vandalism only involve community service. There are no fines involved in that, and many of the vandals are regulars into their 20s and 30s, and many of them have assets that certainly could be tapped to pay for some of the damage they've done. So, I'd like to see something a little tougher in our laws. So, that's one of the things I'm working on, and I thank you for your time.

9.         Director’s Announcements


            


Director Rahaim:


Good afternoon, Commissioners. Just wanted to mention an event that I think I sent you an announcement about, which is an event that I'm moderating next week with an organization called The Council of Tall Buildings and Urban Habitats, an unusual name. Actually an organization that's been around for, since the '60s, it's based in Chicago and there's a group of people trying to start a Chapter here in San Francisco. They are sponsoring this event that they've asked me to moderate to talk about future density and how to make it livable. And, so, there is a panel discussion. That will take place next Tuesday evening at Gensler's offices. And I will, as I said, be moderating that panel. And I think that's it for me today unless there are any questions.

LAND USE COMMITTEE: 


·
         
BF 121019 & 130248 Supervisor Wiener & Kim’s CEQA Procedures Ordinance.
 Both items were called together again at the Committee on Monday.
 
Only Supervisor Wiener’s proposal could be considered for action because Supervisor Kim’s proposal would affect the Historic Preservation Commission and that commission won’t consider her proposal until May 15.  You’ll recall, both this Commission and the HPC supported Supervisor Wiener’s proposal with 2 requested modifications which were addressed by Supervisor Wiener.  This week at committee the following amendments were made:
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


1.
     
31.04(i). Clarifies that when Planning identifies the Approval Action for a CEQA decision it shall post that information on its website, in addition to any other manner that we would choose. (Chiu)
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


2.
     
31.08(d). Provides that departments other than Planning that issue exemptions shall inform Planning and provide Planning with copies and Planning shall make information about such exemptions available on its website to the same extent that it does for other exemptions. (Chiu)
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


3.
     
31.08(i) and 31.19(b). Further clarifies that if an exempt project is modified, an additional CEQA decision is required if the modified project exceeds the scope of the original project for any aspect of the project regulated under the Planning Code or if a new use is introduced. (Chiu)
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


4.
     
31.19(b). Adds a requirement that Planning provide notice when it determines that a project modification is sufficiently minor not to trigger a new CEQA decision. (Chiu)
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


5.
     
31.11(j); 31.15(e). Provides that Planning is not required to file a notice of determination until the Project Sponsor has paid any required fees for such filing. (Wiener)
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


6.
     
31/16(b)(3) Provides that once the Clerk has scheduled an appeal for hearing, other City bodies shall not take action or make approvals. (Chiu)
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


7.
     
31.16(b)(2) Establishes procedures for Clerk & Planning for appeals: Requires that Planning advise the Clerk within three working days of a filed appeal as to whether the appeal is timely. Gives the Clerk seven days from the filing date to determine if the appeal complies with the requirements in the ordinance for filing an appeal. (Clerk proposed; committee included)
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


8.
     
Adds back to Section 31.16(b)(4) language requiring the Clerk to schedule the appeal hearing no less than 30 days after the time for filing an appeal has expired.  With the revision, the Clerk must schedule an appeal hearing no less than 30 and no more than 45 days after the time for filing an appeal has expired. (Chiu)


 


Supervisor Chiu moved to amend the ordinance as described above and Supe. Wiener seconded that motion.  Supervisor Kim asked that the item be continued for two weeks so that her ordinance could also be considered.  Supervisor Chiu stated that he is considering the ideas in her ordinance and believes that a one week continuance is sufficient.  The Committee then continued Supe. Wiener’s Ordinance with Chiu’s amendments to next week.  Supervisor Kim’s Ordinance is expected to be heard in two weeks.


 




 




FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: 


 




Appeals of the CPC decision to certify the Final EIR for 706 Mission Street – The Mexican Museum and Residential Tower Project.  
This Commission certified the final EIR for this project on March 21, 2013.  Three appeals were filed.
  
The appellants included:




 (Lippe Gaffney Wagner) on behalf of the 765 Market Street Residential Owners Association .  


(Brandt-Hawley Law Group) on behalf of TODCO and the Yerba Buena Neighborhood Coalition.  


(Lippe Gaffney Wagner) on behalf of Friends of Yerba Buena and five individuals.
 








The project is proposed as a 550-ft-tall residential tower at 3rd and Mission Streets.  The project would include space for the Mexican Museum in the lower floors of both buildings, up to 215 residential units, and ground floor restaurant or retail.  The Aronson Building would be rehabilitated and restored as part of the project.  The existing Jessie Square Garage would be reconfigured for additional parking spaces: of the 470 parking spaces, 210 would remain publically available. 


Appellants disagreed with the Department that the proposed project would not result in a significant impact to cumulative pedestrian conditions in the area.  Appellants state this should have been identified in the EIR with appropriate mitigation measures to address pedestrian capacity and safety.


Appellants believed that the EIR is inadequate in the following areas: traffic and circulation including pedestrian traffic and safety, shadow on city parks, mitigation measures and alternatives with respect to shadow, historic resources, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, noise, and recreation.    


At the Board hearing, staff explained that the EIR appeal letters raised a number of issues that are the same as or similar to those addressed in the FEIR.  


At Tuesday’s hearing, the Board members focused their discussion on shadow impacts, pedestrian impacts analysis and traffic analysis, and project alternatives.  The proposed project is in Supervisor Jane Kim’s District and she led the discussion and questioning.  


With respect to shadow, the Supervisors were particularly interested in the basis for the significance determinations, and in the treatment of parks protected under Section 295 versus non-Rec Park properties.  Questions were also raised with respect to the role of mitigation measures as compared to that of alternatives.  Both mechanisms are intended to address (that is, reduce or eliminate) significant environmental impacts of the project.  With respect to the proposed project’s considerable contribution to the significant cumulative shadow impact, two alternatives that reduce shadow impacts were fully analyzed in the EIR.


Supervisor asked questions regarding the financial feasibility of a building that would not shade Union Square.  Information regarding the financial feasibility of a project that would not shade Union Square will be provided during the consideration of the project entitlements.


With respect to pedestrian analysis, the Board questioned how the baseline analysis is assessed
[1]
.  Staff clarified that the Department’s transportation impact analyses use typical baseline conditions in the project area
[2]
.  The Department believes that using typical baseline conditions results in a fairer assessment of the project’s impacts.  However, the Supervisors expressed concerned regarding this approach for an area already experiencing crowded conditions such as around the project site.


The Supervisors expressed support for the Mexican Museum.  Supervisors Kim and Campos [possibly others] requested that the Project Sponsor continue to work with appellants to address their concerns, particularly with respect to shadow and traffic.  The Supervisors look forward to hearing more about the project at the time of project approvals.


While Supervisor Kim had many questions for the Planning Staff, she ultimately agreed with the decision and analysis of the Department.  The Board voted unanimously to uphold the Commission’s decision to certify the final EIR.
