Future Meetings/Agendas
.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.


 


Commissioner Antonini:


A few items in regard to the Secretary Search Subcommittee, we met yesterday and we'll be meeting again next Wednesday and we're having some input on a couple of areas. Basically, the questions, that are going to be asked, and the rating of the questions.  We have a substance material expert, who is analyzing these. I can’t go into more detail, because this is not a calendared item.  But once this step is finished and the Subcommittee has approved some it we will begin to post the job position and it will be posted for 30 to 45 days. I would like to ask Vice-Chair Wu, if it could be calendared at a time that I can give more details maybe in two or three weeks.


I have a couple of other comments. An article in today's Chronicle, it kind of plays into some of my remarks from last week, when I talk about illegal units particularly in the Richmond and the Sunset, this deals with a number of houses where the lawns or green areas in front of the houses have been paved over to provide additional parking or just because the owners don't want to put the time and effort into maintaining them. We do have a law that was mentioned, that was passed in 2002, that this is not allowed and they did make references in this article to the Planning Department and the fact that we did not have the funding to be able to police this, but I would actually support as much attention as we can give or at least identification of…where we could go out and see which ones have been paved over and send out notices of violation, but there have been a number of these that have been eliminated.  In the same regard, I remembered I might have mentioned before, in 1965 was a beautiful autumn day. I had driven into San Francisco at that time I was still living in the Livermore/Pleasanton area and I stopped to do some shopping. I thought it was such a nice day I drove out on Geary Boulevard, and was struck by the beauty of the little houses down the Avenues. When there was an elevation change I stopped and got and took a look.  They were so well maintained and they all had their areas of little lawns in front of them I think it's a shame this is happening and this is designed to be an area of starter homes for people or maybe homes for their entire life and they should be reserved to be single-family homes as they are designed to be.  There are plenty of places in the City and many projects coming before us with denser higher density project, but they should be part of this City that is reserved for single family owned, and this is just one of the symptoms you'll see with this paving over. Finally, we see the stage play last night ”Anything Goes”  which is fantastic Cole Porter songs at the Golden Gate, and after that we went to Market Street and we were impressed that the crowds from the Golden Gate and Orpheum, with the crowds who were related to the opening of the Jazz Center, changed the area to make it much more inviting to be there, the presence of security including uniformed Police Officers. If we can develop those areas in a positive way, especially night time activities and a sign of good things to come.


Commissioner Moore:


In the latter part of last week’s hearing, Planner Kate McGee, gave a presentation on Eco Districts and Sustainable Development, and it must have been that either I was too tired or everybody else had already checked out, because there were no questions or any other feedback to her on that matter. When I started to think about it, I think it is an extremely important and forward looking
 
topic
. I would ask that she be brought back and that we spend 
time for
 a brief discussion with her 
and talk
 
about how that thinking can be supported by us 
when
 commenting on development, as we see it, to realize a larger ability to deal with those ideas. I think it's a missed opportunity.  I, at least 
speaking
 for myself, for not having asked questions. This is the kind of the stuff that we really should be 
proactively involved with: - exchanging ideas, - inviting ideas and feedback
, because that is where I think we can be very powerful developing future policy and future new mechanisms 
for  sustainable districts or the sustainable city
.  So, I make a pitch here for all us to support such a follow up, and actually, I listened to it again and I appreciated the presentation.  What was missing, really, is we didn't have a handout.  So we were just sitting there and we didn’t even get anything to take home.  I frankly was tired and didn’t want to dig in.


 


 


Commissioner Sugaya
:


Could we have a little report from staff about closing the ramps on Highway 380. I don’t’ think we need a hearing just yet. I assume something more informational will come forward by maybe a little bit more information than what was in the paper. Secondly, in the paper the America's Cup is going to be sponsored by whatever planet it is called Live Nation, and occasional entertainment on Pier 29, is that not within City’s jurisdiction or is that something that can happen, because it is temporary, or because it is  under the Port jurisdiction.  


Commissioner Wu:


I wanted to bring up I believe this Monday there's going to be a hearing about land use and condominium conversion. We had it on our consent calendar today and I believe that's the process all of these 4 and 5 or 5 and 6 buildings conversions come through. I think, I just want for myself, information to remind us, who enforces the subdivision code and how we verifying that there is owner occupancy of these units, and how we are verifying. I believe in the case where there is a renter, the renter is offered a year lease if they are in an special category that they are offered  lifetime lease. How are we enforcing or how we can verify all of that 


Commissioner Antonini:


In regards to the comments of Commissioner Moore regarding Kate McGee’s presentation I am supportive of bringing that back. However, I did make comments and asked her questions last week.  I can’t remember the exact content, but I did ask to make sure that the sustainable features are attractive and practical and not just sustainable, but also something that add to the appearance of the areas, where they take place. 


Commissioner Moore


As a follow-up to your own comments Commissioner Wu, I actually meant to speak about that, because there was an additional discussion this morning that Supervisors Farrell and Weiner are looking for modifications of tenant and condominium issue related matters.  It would also help all of us to gather every so often to review the current legislation that indeed is empowering us to do things, I didn’t feel like pulling the condominium project on Herman Street off the consent calendar, but I did have the question of whether this project is a condominium conversion, which is normally the step which precede this. I would like to have a refresher on the laws and how we're currently supposed to use them.

9.         Director’s Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


Good afternoon Commissioners, just two announcements.  There were public meetings this week kicking off two new streetscape projects; one was in the Castro where we are looking at the stretch of Market between Castro and 18
th
, and looking at potential sidewalk improvements, that is actually one of the busiest pedestrian thoroughfares, it has more pedestrian traffic than Columbus in North Beach.  We are looking at that stretch in Castro and we are also looking at the area in the Outer Mission often called the Persian Triangle a convergence of multiple streets, Mission and Ocean Avenue, I think, which is a long-standing desire of the public to make a better place there. Both of these streetscape projects look for better design of those areas. In both of these cases we would likely be able to move forward because these were projects that were identified for funding from the Streets Bond that was passed in 2011 and that Bond did have a small pot of money for streetscape improvements. We will be able to withdraw money for public works and move forward with implementation for both of those projects.  I should announce to the Commission that I'm speaking to SPUR on Tuesday night regarding the Department’s record and where I see the Department going in the next couple of years, and that concludes my presentation.
