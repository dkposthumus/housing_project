Future Meetings/Agendas

At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.


 


Commissioner Antonini:


Yeah, excuse me for not necessarily knowing the name of this measure, but I believe it was Prop C on last November's ballot and it has to do with the Mayor's Housing policies and with particular reference to the first responder down payment assistance. And I know the Supervisors have been discussing that,
  
and because we deal with this all the time, whatever kind of update we can get on what's going on because there's some interesting issues regarding what income levels it would apply to, if there are any restrictions, because this is a loan, I understand, it's not a gift that has to be paid back on the sale of the property, or whether or not first responder living in Petaluma or 

Fremont could sell their house and, you know, apply this towards their first purchase in San Francisco or if it has to be the first home they've ever purchased. So, these are some interesting issues that I think could be very helpful in putting more first responders within the City where they can help us in terms of disasters or when the needs are really high.
  
So, any information that we can get from staff on where this particular thing is, apparently, the ballot measure didn't spell out some of these questions that I was raising today. 


Commissioner Wu:


I want to welcome even though they're not here yet, a group of students from something called the Chinatown Urban Institute. They participate in an 8-week program.
  
There are 12 students learning about community-based planning. They're meeting with Supervisor Kim right now and they'll come in around one o'clock just so the Commission knows who they are.


Commissioner Moore:


I attended the Better Market Street Workshop last night. I was looking for Planning and I saw a couple. It was well attended and very interesting, and at some point I hope that somebody in the Department, perhaps Neil, will come around and at least give a brief overview about process as well as preferred alternatives. 


 


Commissioner Sugaya:


On a similar vein, perhaps we could have some informational meeting on Polk Street since it was published in the paper today, regarding the proposed the changes from MTA. 


 


Commissioner Antonini:


And also in terms of meetings we've attended, I did meet with Project Sponsor and property owner of a proposed cell phone installation that will be coming before us.
  
I forget, it may be 600 Stockton, but it's on the corner of Stockton and Clay.
  
And also I met with Project Sponsors in regards to an issue that's coming before us in a few weeks regarding Pet Food Express.

Director’s Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


Good afternoon, Commissioners. A couple of items in your packet today are a memo and a report from Dan Sider regarding the Transfer Development Rights Program.
  
It's a summary of the study that we had conducted with Seifel Consulting looking at that program, looking at potential market analysis of possible sale of TDRs from City-owned properties. This was a result of discussions with several City departments and we did -- I think Dan just yesterday had a presentation of this to the Historic Preservation Commission and we're happy to answer any questions or have a future hearing on it, if you so desire. We don't know yet if there's -- I don't believe we are proposing any legislative changes at this point. This is more kind of a market analysis and a kind of a snapshot of where that program is right now.
  
Secondly, I just wanted to let you know that in your packet today, that you'll get today, is a memo from me that -- regarding information that you requested about concentration and controls for restaurants. This came out of a discussion that you had on June 20th on the 443 Clement Street project. This is not related to formula retail. It is related simply to the concentration of eating and drinking establishments, and in that memo we summarize some of the current status of the General Plan and the code amendments on that issue, and the Code, Planning Code provisions on that issue and I'm proposing that we look at that in the context of the invest in neighborhoods strategy which is a strategy that a number of departments, including the Planning Department are involved in now in 25 commercial districts across the City. But again, that memo is in your packet today and we're happy to have a hearing on that at a future date if you so desire, and that concludes my report.

Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission


 


BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:


LAND USE COMMITTEE:
  


General Plan & Planning Code Amendment for Bicycle Parking.


The Bicycle Parking legislation and along with the re-adoption of General Plan amendments for the Bike Plan were before the Land Use Committee on Monday. This Commission approved these two ordinances unanimously on May 16th with some modifications. Since then Supervisor Avalos sponsored this legislation and amended the language to reflect this Commission's recommendation. Additionally, during this time staff heard from the SFMTA Off-street Parking Division regarding provisions for temporary exemptions on city-owned garages to comply with the new requirements. Supervisor Avalos in collaboration with Planning staff made amendments to the legislation to allow for such temporary exemptions similar to exemptions available for other City-owned buildings. T
he Land Use Committee moved this legislation with the associated amendments to the Board for their approval.
  


·
         
Planning Code & Zoning Map Amend for Yerba Buena.
  
May 23, PC recommended approval. This week’s hearing was long at over 2 hrs.
  
Cmte members queried Successor Agency staff regarding the value of the public benefits package negotiated between the Agency and the Project Sponsor.
  
There were numerous speakers in favor of the project, particularly stressing the importance of the Mexican Museum as a cultural institution.
  
There were also several speakers in opposition to the project, expressing concern re: Union Square shadows.
  
Tom Lippe, attorney for "765 Market Street Residential Owner's Association" and "Friends of Yerba Buena" stated that his clients are supportive of the Mexican Museum, but oppose the height of the residential tower. Mr. Lippe cited a study prepared by Eric Sussman of UCLA that contests the conclusions of the EPS financial feasibility study prepared for the project. Specifically, Mr. Lippe argued that the assumptions of the EPS study regarding sales prices of the proposed units were inaccurate, and that the project could be viable at 351 feet (height at which no new shadow would be cast on Union Square).
  
A representative of Keyser Marston (peer reviewer of the EPS study) responded to these issues, stating that the Sussman study itself was flawed, because it overestimates the sales prices of the proposed units at a lower height scenario (ie there would be fewer "view units" commanding a premium, therefore jeopardizing the financial feasibility of the project and/or the public benefits package associated with the project).
  
The Cmte continued the item to next Monday's hearing. The item on 7/22 will be a Committee Report, and the full Board will consider the Legislation as scheduled the next day (7/23). 


·
         
Inclusionary Housing.
  
This Ordinance would amending the Planning Code to add a definition of “significant increase in residential development potential” consistent with the Housing Trust Fund provisions in Charter.
  
The Planning Commission recommended approval on June 6
th
.
  
The Board can only approve or disapprove but like the PC could not amend the proposal from the Housing Review Committee.
  
(20% or more increase in FAR, change to residential, or for parcels with development capacity of 10+ units, a 50% or more increase or an addition of 15 or more du).
  
This week the Committee recommended approval to the Full Board.


FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: 


·
         
CEQA Ordinances.  
Both Supervisor Wiener’s and Supervisor Kim’s CEQA ordinances were back before the Full Board.  Supervisor Wiener noted that this was the many public hearing on his ordinance (inclusive of hearings before this commission).  He also thanked Chiu for his amendments to improve the Ord.
  
Supe. Chiu noted that he was hopeful that the amend. would result in consensus.  He thanked Supe W for compromising and having a commitment to good governance and thanked Supe Kim for responding to advocates.
  
Many other thanks followed.
  
Supe Kim stated that Chiu’s amendments combine the two perspective and resulted in an ord with clear procedures and deadlines while protecting the public right to know.
  
The final version does require posting of all exemptions in a sortable manner and preserves the full appeal hearing for EIRs.
  
Supe Yee noted that he was happy pedestrian safety is prioritized. Supe Campos noted he was happy to see the board working together and thought the result struck the right balance.
  
After numerous remarks were made, Supervisors Chiu, Kim, Cohen and Mar requested to become co-sponsors and the ordinance was passed unanimously with Chiu’s amendments

·
         
Maher Ordinance.
 
In May, staff presented to the Planning Commission a proposal to amend portions of the Health and Building Codes (more commonly referred to as the Maher Ordinance).
  
The Maher Ordinance requires an investigation into whether soils at a proposed project site are contaminated, and if so, how to properly handle the soils and what level of clean up may be required for the intended use – under Health Department supervision.
  
The Maher Ordinance presently applies only along the City’s eastern shore and the proposal would expand the geographic scope of the ordinance so that it would apply strategically throughout the City in areas where there is an increased potential for soils contamination (e.g., industrial zones, and sites with underground storage tanks.)


The proposal was unanimously endorsed by the Planning Commission on May 16.
  
It was also endorsed by the Health and Building Commissions, as well as by the Board of Supervisors Land Use Committee.
  
At the full Board’s July 16 hearing, the ordinance was approved on its second reading

The proposed ordinance would allow a neighborhood-serving nonprofit institution with a use size over 4,000 sq.ft. to apply for a Conditional Use Authorization in the Castro NCD. There would be no numerical cap or a sunset clause; rather it would permit these uses to be approved by the Planning Commission on a case-by-case basis. The regular CU criteria and processes apply

BOARD OF APPEALS:


The Board of Appeals did meet last night. The Board of Appeals report, but first 706 Mission, 309 Appeal will be heard by the Board of Appeals on their next hearing, which is July 31st. There is also a jurisdiction request on the Section 295 Determinations of the Commission. The Board of Appeals rejected the appeal, but they attempted to file on that because it is not a permit and therefore not appealable to the Board. But they filed a jurisdiction request to have the Board make that decision, as well, and that will be heard on the 31
st
, as well. But last night's hearing was quite lengthy and the Board considered several items I think might be of interest to the Commission. There were a couple of DPW permits for public right-of-way. One for 75 Mars, this is a project that the Planning Commission heard under DR quite sometimes ago and this was an encroachment permit to do improvements in the public right-of-way for stairs to connect two streets. There was also access stairs to a door on the side of the building that was on the plans that the Commission had approved and neighbors were concerned that this may create an attractive nuisance. It is an existing stair that is being rebuilt. The Board upheld that permit. There was also the first appeal of a parklet, and this was at 3930 to 3940 Judah Street, and it’s in front of Other Avenues Food Store. The Board ultimately upheld this permit, but there were issues and concerns about the concentration of parklets. This would be the third one within two blocks. There are some on the other side of Judah and on the next block down. There are also concerns about the loss of parking and impacts on deliveries and whether or not there will be increased double parking there.
  
I’d like to thank Paul Chasan of our Department staff, he is our Parklet Manager, and he presented at the Board of Appeals and answered their questions, but they did uphold that parklet permit, and two other items, one was a letter of determination I issued for 2101 Mariposa, this was an appeal of determination for the Slovenian Hall, I found it was an existing legal nonconforming use in terms of the venue, but it also requested that there was an existing legal nonconforming use in terms of a commercial kitchen, and that it could be used for food production not related to the operation of the hall.
  
I didn't find any evidence, historical evidence, of that.
  
It’s in a residential zoning district and that use would not be allowed. The Board did uphold that determination and that item is final, and finally, 70 Crestline Drive, which was something that the Planning Commission had heard, you might recall that the Planning Department recommended denial of this project. The Planning Commission approved the project.
  
Last night it was appealed by a significant number of neighbors in the community, quite a substantial turnout there.
  
And the Board did vote 4 to 1 to overturn the permit and so they upheld the appeal and denied the permit and they cited the staff review and recommendation on that. So, that's for your information. Thank you. 


 


HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:


Here to share a couple items from yesterday's Historic Preservation Commission hearing. The Department and Seifel Consulting gave the HPC an overview of a market analysis of the City's TDR program. This report was also forwarded to the Planning Commission, earlier this summer.
  
The study was mainly commissioned to provide the City information on whether or not it would be feasible to sell TDR from City-owned properties in order to fund essential seismic and rehabilitation upgrades to those historic buildings that are eligible and adjacent to the C-3 District. The item was just informational.
  
Overall the HPC agreed with the report and made some comments on areas of the program that warranted further study or consideration by the City. The HPC also showed its enthusiastic support for the JCHESS which is also on your calendar today, as an informational item. The HPC reviewed the CEQA amendments that are also on your calendar today and after presentations by staff, Supervisor Kim and Weiner’s Office and a good deal of public testimony, the HPC passed a recommendation 6 to 1 in support of Supervisor Kim and Chiu's additional amendments. I believe staff will go into more detail about the HPC's recommendation and comments on that item once it's called. And then finally, the HPC is considering to initiate landmark designation for Marcus Brooks, per Article 10 of the Planning Code.
  
The HPC, though, continued the item to its August 21
st
 hearing at the request of the current property owner. So, on August 21
st
, they will take up the matter at that time, if they do choose to initiate designation on the Marcus Brooks Building it will then be forwarded to the Board of Supervisors for final consideration of that landmark designation. And that concludes my report to you unless you have any comments

 Effective November 23, 2010, the Board of Supervisors required the Department of Public Health and the Planning Department to prepare a Health Care Services Master Plan (HCSMP), through Ordinance No. 300-10, to “provide the Health Commission, the Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors with 
information and public policy recommendations
