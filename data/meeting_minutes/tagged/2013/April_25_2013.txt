Commissioner Antonini:


A couple of things I wanted to mention. First of all, that Commissioner Moore and I took part in a presentation yesterday about a couple projects that will be coming before us in the future. They involve Kaiser Outpatient Facility near Potrero Hill, as well as the housing developments, they are married, the two projects are being planned together. And it was very interesting and it's good to see those things ahead of time, particularly in regards to design issues and other things that the projects improve before the time they even get to the Commission because of public comment and comments of Commissioners. I met with John Elberling from TODCO, just to discuss some of his concerns regarding the Central Corridor issue as well as pedestrian access around Moscone and I think it was a very good meeting. And, also yesterday we had a meeting of the Secretary Search Subcommittee and part of it was in Closed Session, but, you know, of which we do not reveal the actions. There were no actions, in fact. So, I can say that we are considering the candidates who have gone through the testing process and it appears we have an adequate number of applicants and we're going to continue to work on this in subsequent weeks. And finally, I must report I'm not a real frequent Muni rider, but I did get a citation today riding Muni Metro and I would admonish you to make sure that when you board Muni and you're not boarding at one of the stations where you automatically punch your thing in, to make sure as soon as you get on your car to log your little card onto the thing, if you don't do that, you know, it could be an expensive problem afterwards, but, you know, I'm glad to see they're doing that and I appreciate it and I appreciate what you have to do, but it's easy to be absent minded sometimes and that's what happens.


 


Commissioner Moore:


Commissioner Antonini, why don't you share the hit you got? 


 


Commissioner Antonini:


Oh, I think its $103 if I'm not mistaken is what the citation is. There are not warnings, so, it's first time you get a citation probably.

LAND USE COMMITTEE: 


·
         
BF 121019 & 130248 Supervisor Wiener & Kim’s CEQA Procedures Ordinance.
 Both items were called together at the Committee on Monday.
 
Only Supervisor Wiener’s proposal could be considered for action because Supervisor Kim’s proposal would affect the Historic Preservation Commission and that commission won’t consider her proposal until May 15.  You’ll recall, both this Commission and the HPC supported Supervisor Wiener’s proposal with 2 requested modifications which were addressed by Supervisor Wiener.  This week at the Committee Supervisor Campos joined the hearing for this item.  He stated that CEQA is an important tool to give voice to public and that this opportunity results in better process.  He cited the leverage that the City had over CPMC as an example.  Supervisor Wiener reassured the committee that his ordinance does not change state law but only establishes rules for appeals.  He stated that Supervisor Kim’s ordinance doe much more and results in a less clear process.  Supervisor Kim clarified that her ordinance did not intend to allow for multiple appeals, for the PC to approve each exemption and that she is open to changing the portion of her ordinance which allows the ERO to delegate some CEQA review authority to other agencies.  Supervisor Chiu said that he now considers CEQA to be his favorite four letter word. He stated that he had met with concerned community members and had crafted 9 amendments that he would like to make to Supervisor Wiener’s proposal.  Later in today’s hearing under 11 we will give the commission a supplemental memo with the full language.  For now, I will summarize the 9 amendments:
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


1.
     
Require that all hearings on CEQA appeals be before the full Board.
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


2.
     
Minimize changes to the EIR process.
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


3.
     
Fair argument language is added in more places.
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


4.
     
Require that the Department provide notice for all exemptions on our website prior to the ordinance taking effect.
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


5.
     
Keep the status quo on submitting documents.
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


6.
     
Require that the Department identify the “first approval” for each CEQA document.
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


7.
     
Allow appeals of exemptions and neg decs to be filed earlier in the process: after the CEQA determination instead of after the first approval.
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


8.
     
Require that project modifications be re-referred the ERO and that where projects no longer match the original scope, a new CEQA review would be required.
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


9.
     
Require that electronic notices be provided in hard copy upon request. 


After a couple of hours of public the hearing, Supervisor Kim stated that she would be included to add staffing to the Planning Department if that is what’s needed for a subscription based email notification system.  Supervisor Chiu moved to amend the ordinance as described above and Supe. Wiener seconded that motion.  The Committee then continued the item for two weeks to May 6.


 




 




FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: 


·
         
BF 120901 Upper Market Zoning. 
The draft Ordinance had three components:
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


1.
             
Conversion from NCD to NCT:
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


2.
             
Height Change: for one parcel from 50-X to 65-B.
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


3.
             
Food Processing: allow as an accessory use to a non-residential establishment.  


On February 21, 2013, the Planning Commission recommended approval with 2 modifications of this proposal as follows:
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


1.
             
That the Upper Market NCD (Planning Code Section 721.1) be eliminated in its entirety and replaced by the Upper Market NCT (Planning Code Section 733.1.T recommendation was not incorporated by Supervisor Wiener as he must recuse himself from rezonings within a close distance of his home.
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


2.
             
The minor technical amendments recommended by this commission were incorporated.


Supervisor Wiener amended the draft Ordinance such that the new height would be 62-B, rather than 65-B.  The technical amendments were made but there will be one remaining parcel zoned NCD—the department will be asking this commission to initiate an ordinance to make this remaining fix next month.


 




Items that were adopted this week on Final Read include:






Polk Street Tobacco and Alcohol Controls
[1]
.
 










INTRODUCTIONS: 


·
         
Supervisor Cohen introduced BF 130372: Ordinance to create the Third Street Formula Retail Restricted Use District for property located on Third Street between Williams Avenue and Egbert Avenue.  
This item will be scheduled for hearing before you within 90 days.


·
         
Mayor Lee introduced BF 130369 to amend the Building Code, Public Works Code and Health Code to expand the boundaries and types of projects for which soil testing is required and to require testing of groundwater under specified circumstances.  
The Department assisted the Mayor on this legislative work and although this item does not amend the Planning Code, it will likely be brought before you in the near term.
