Commissioner Moore:


We are hearing a lot of discussion about affordability and housing, while we believe that is an issue, the rest of the Country is concerned about it as well. I am very happy to read in the paper that on Tuesday, the San Francisco Unified School District authorized a swap of parcels of an underutilized property on 6 --
  
on 1950 Mission Street, not 1650 Mission Street, that the Mayor's Office of Housing would be able to consider a 115 affordable units on that lot. I thought it was a great idea, and I couldn't be happier that we are starting to look very, very closely of what properties are underutilized and for what purpose that can be re-adapted. The second thing, which is also addressing that very same issue, is what's happened at the Board of Supervisors. I do not want to jump ahead of Ms. Rogers who will probably report on it, but I'm delighted to see that there were three items, which, again address issues of affordability in San Francisco and tenant protection under the Ellis Act Evictions. So, I couldn't be more pleased hearing that during this time of year.


 


Commissioner Antonini:


Article in today's Chronicle by James Temple and the title of it is very good “Affordability must be tackled by the entire region.” Unfortunately the article, while it is thoughtfully written, the solutions that he proposes, at least, in part, are not really in my estimation a solution. He sort of talks about other parts of the Bay Area becoming more dense and attracting some of the people who want to come to San Francisco because we've asked them to densify, we asked them to come here to live in less space, to take public transit to locate businesses close to transit where people live and he's saying that other parts of the Bay Area should be do those things too. I'm not against that. But, that's not the problem. It’s actually, we asked people to do this. They came here, it’s been successful and as a result prices are going up for housing and for everything else, but land values are increasing. And so, you can't have it both ways. Unfortunately I think, but the important thing that he brings up is all the counties in the Bay Area have to address affordability equally and they have to consider at least the five immediate bay area counties as an entity rather than singling out individual areas; particularly San Francisco which is kind of an odd situation. Second densest city in United States, almost completely built out with the exception of a few areas that are – that have some promise for additional housing and by nature it has to grow with density. There is a lot of space in Marin and
  
San Mateo County, and even Alameda and Contra Costa Counties, I think there needs to be some sort of ability to work as a region a little bit more.
  
New York has the advantage of the five boroughs, that are actually five separate counties and they make up the City of New York, and I am sure, a lot of decisions
  
are made collectively by the entire City
  
rather than saying we have to solve the problem just in Manhattan or just in the Bronx.
  
The standards are the same for all the boroughs, one would expect.
  
So, I think he makes a good point. But, I think San Francisco had done more than other regions have
  
in fact
  
I believe all the housing in Transbay, is now going to be, at least 27% affordable maybe higher than that, I forget what the percentage is demanded. There are thousands of units going to be built there and I'm wondering maybe staff can give us a report. I know they annually do, about what's happening in other counties around San Francisco as far as their inclusionary housing requirements, and each city is different, of course and what they are providing in terms of affordable units relative to what San Francisco is doing, so, I think that would be an interesting thing to learn about.

Director’s Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


Good afternoon Commissioners, if my voice holds up, I just wanted to let you know that we are starting budget season. And the packet that you will receive today for next week you will be seeing a memo giving you an outline of a current status of this Department's budget and revenues and expenditures and then in mid-January we will start meeting with you and the Historic Preservation Commission on the Work Plan and upcoming budget items. We look forward to having that discussion with you in the next few weeks. Thank you.

Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission


 


BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:


 


LAND USE COMMITTEE:
  


·
         
On Monday, the Land Use Committee considered two draft Ordinances introduced by Supervisor Avalos, the Residential Demolition, Merger, and Conversion Ordinance
[1]
 and Enlargement of Nonconforming Units
[2]
.
  
The Planning Commission has considered both files – which were originally a single large Ordinance – a number of times since July of this year.
  
On Sept 19
[3]
 & Oct 24
[4]
, the Commission made recommendations. Your recommended modifications for residential demolition ordinance, included:
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


1.
       
That the ten year prohibition on approving the loss of units that had been the subject of no fault evictions begin with evictions filed after October 24, 2013;
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


2.
       
That the Ordinance consider Owner Move-In and other “no-fault” evictions differently than Ellis Evictions.


At Monday’s Committee hearing, Supervisor Avalos made several amendments, and discussed additional amendments, but language was not finalized.
  
On Tuesday the full Board considered both Ordinances, and passed them both on their first reading with the following amendments:
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


1.
       
The prohibition on approving the loss of dwellings that have been the subject of no-fault evictions applies only to mergers, not to demos or conversions;
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


2.
       
The prohibition is triggered by evictions that occurred after 12/10/13;
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


3.
       
Clarifying language was added that excludes group housing that is subject to the Residential Hotel Conversion Ordinance from the controls of Section 317;
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


4.
       
In units that used the Owner Move-In eviction process, the prohibition on approving mergers lasts for five years rather than ten years.


The vote at Tuesday’s Board hearing was 11-0.The Cottage Food Ordnance was heard at this week’s land use committee hearing. This ordinance would amend the Planning Code to allow Cottage Food operations as an accessory use to residential units.
  
It would also increase the allowable floor area for accessory uses from ¼ to 1/3 of the floor area, and standardized accessory use controls for residential units in all zoning districts. A cottage food operation, unlike other types of commercial food facilities, can be operated out of a home kitchen
[5]
. This commission voted on on November 21 to recommend approval to the Board.
  
At the hearing Supervisor Chiu mentioned sponsoring an Ordinance that would create a 1-year waiver for the 1- time $133 Cottage Food Operations referral fee to the Planning Department.
  
The Department expressed support for such an idea, as it would allow the Department to evaluate the impact the waiver would have on our budget.
  
So far this year, the Department reviewed 21 Cottage Food Operation referrals, for a total amount of $2,793.
  
Should the number of applications next year be similar to this year, the Department believes that the impact on our budget will be minimal and can be covered by our existing revenue.
  
After that discussion, the committee sent the ordinance to the full board as a committee report with a recommendation for approval.
  
The ordinance passed at the full board the following day on its first reading.
  
The second reading of this ordinance will be this coming Tuesday.
   


 


FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: 


·
         
On Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors passed for its final read Board File 13-0968, legislation sponsored by Supervisor Chiu to create the Ellis-Act Displaced Tenants Emergency Assistance Program.
  
The Planning Commission recommended approval on November 21st.
  
The Board incorporated the recommendation of the Commission, which was to include a requirement for a hearing at the Board after three years that includes demographic and income levels of beneficiaries of the preference.
  
In addition, the legislation was amended to extend the new preference to disabled tenants who have lived in a unit for at least five years, rather than the generally required ten years. 


·
         
Interim Zoning Controls - Building Permits for Commercial Buildings in an Area Bounded by Market, Second, Brannan, Division, and South Van Ness Streets.
    
This resolution would imposing interim zoning controls to require that for a 12-month period in the area that is generally Market Street and most of SoMa
[6]
: 1) certain building permits for commercial buildings shall require the posting of a notice and a 15-day delay in starting the work; and 2) the re-establishment of a commercial use that has been converted to residential use shall require Planning Commission approval through CU authorization and, if needed Prop M. As an interim control, this was not considered by this Commission but the Planning Director had spoke in support at an early committee hearing.
  
This week the Board made a technical amendment and approved the resolution.
  
It will be sent to the Mayor for approval this week.

BOARD OF APPEALS: 


Good afternoon Commissioners, Corey Teague, for Planning Department staff.
  
The Board of Appeals did meet last night and there was one case of interest, and that was for the appeal of the building permit for 1050 Valencia Street, which is located at the corner of Valencia and Hill Streets. This is a five-story, 55-foot tall proposal with 12 dwelling units and ground floor retail space. Just to remind you a little bit of the history. This project was a code-compliant project that did not require any entitlements from the Planning Commission, or any variances from the Zoning Administrator. However, Discretionary Review was requested by the neighboring property owner at The Marsh Theatre and also by the Liberty Hill Neighborhood Association. The Planning Commission heard that DR
  
in 2012 and on September 6, 2012, took DR and approved the project with some -- no modifications to the project itself, but adding some conditions regarding refinement of the bay windows, establishing a community liaison, additional noise control features and limited construction hours and then it also encouraged the Project Sponsor
  
to work with the Marsh Theater on the
  
sound issues and other issues,
  
and
  
also encouraged the Project Sponsor to work with staff and the community, to provide some kind of stepping down Hill Street, but not reduce the number of dwelling units in the proposal. The Mitigated Negative Declaration for the project was also appealed to both the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors. Planning Commission upheld the Mitigated Negative Declaration on September 30
th
, 2010, and the Board of Supervisors also upheld it just recently on November 5
th
 of this year. So, the Board of Appeals hearing last night was quite long. As you can imagine there was a good bit of public comment. In the end, the Board did vote unanimously to adopt the motion to grant all of the appeals and approve the permit with very specific conditions. Those conditions were to remove the entire top floor of the project, also to upgrade the party wall with The Marsh to 50 dba value for sound rating; The Marsh had also worked with the project sponsor to jointly agree on other certain conditions. Those conditions included, beyond a community liaison, having a more construction related person on-site to be a point of contact to deal specifically with construction issues. Also, to allow the Marsh to request up to 20 times per year, with two weeks advance notice, of specific times
  
of specific shows or events that they would like no construction to be happening and causing specific noise, to not allow trucks to be idling for more than five minutes on the street unless they are performing a specific construction
  
purpose, like a concrete truck pouring concrete, also to add a disclosure
  
requirement similar to what we used to do in the past
  
informing any potential buyer of a unit in this development that they would be moving next to a theatre that has performances and creates certain amount of noise. And then there were several other conditions proposed by the Marsh that the project sponsor had not agreed to, that the Board of Appeals also included in the conditions. One was to limit the construction hours even further, and I can detail that if you like. Also, to require a Notice of Special Restrictions be recorded basically to codify all of these conditions. And then, finally the project was actually then continued to January 15
th
, so that detailed findings could be drafted because there was a lot here to digest. Parties involved will have an opportunity to rebut the findings. They are also invited to submit their own draft findings. The matter is not completely finalized at this point, but they did take the motion to grant the appeals and take those actions last night and the next Board hearing for this project is January 15
th
, to discuss the adoption of findings. Available for questions, which I assume you may have.
