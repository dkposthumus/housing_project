Commissioner Antonini:


I'm in receipt of a report from the Office of Economic and Work Force Development and am happy to report that there was some good news. And one of the items was that San Francisco is the fastest growing county in private sector job rate growth of 6.1 between 2011-2012, and although the tech industry in and of itself had created 20,000 jobs in San Francisco since 2010. And unemployment rate was down 1.8% from the previous year in July of this year. So, anyway, these are all very good information and there's more in the report, more detail, and its welcome news. However, there's one discrepancy that I find in that report based upon other sources. That report stated the employment totals, those employed in San Francisco at about 486,000 people.
  
In the San Francisco Business Times, with their source being ABAG, reported the number at 580,000. So, that's a big discrepancy, so, I would ask that, you know,
  
perhaps we can have some research done to find out what, in fact, the total employment in San Francisco is at the date that's referenced in that article and establish a little bit more of an accurate figure.
  
Secondly, I do want to report that the Subcommittee Secretary Search Subcommittee met yesterday and action was taken to recommend a candidate.
  
And the Presidents of the two Commissions have been informed, and they will have to take action to schedule a hearing for the two Commissions to independently vote to accept or reject our recommendations. So, it's been a long process, and I'm happy that it appears that it's headed towards its finish. And I will tell you in more detail about all the things that this subcommittee did over the year plus that we worked on this particular thing and we continue to do more. Thank you. 


Commissioner Borden:


I don't know if anyone saw in the paper today, San Jose Mercury News there is an article that the California Supreme Court is going to rehear the case that was filed against the City of San Jose’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance. And, I would just like to ask the Director, you know, if the City is going to be doing an amicus brief or anything to get involved in that case because obviously we have a vested interest in the outcome of it. So, maybe we can look into that. And if the City isn't going to take a position, maybe this Commission could send a letter related to the case.
  
The other thing is last week I got to go along -- I actually saw Director Rahaim, from Planning staff Neil Hrushowy, and I went to a launch of the Living Innovation Zone, which is this new project, to kind of create, kind of the innovation in the public space and looking at Market Street, in particular, the sites, kind of in between where that Yerba Buena Alley is, on Market between Fourth and Fifth -- Fourth and Third, actually.
  
And it's actually really interesting, the Exploratorium is there, looking at all the different kinds of unique kind of interactive experiences and activities that we could create and as many people may not be aware they actually launched a campaign Indiegogo to raise money for the Living Innovation Zone so it wouldn't cost the City any money to put some fun, innovative interactive activities in the public space. But, I do encourage people who are interested in that, to learn more about that, it’s called liz or living innovation zone. And I think it's lizsf.org if I'm not mistaken. But, I thought it was really fascinating and it's a great way to kind of activate public space. To really bring to fore, the kind of innovation we really talk about in the City is known for, but make it part of the experience that everyday citizens and tourists will embrace. 


 


Commissioner Moore:


It was only on the back pages of the Chronicle, but a few days ago I read that Fresh and Easy has been bought by the Yucaipa Companies, which is one of Burkle’s supermarket chains in California and I was very unhappy to hear that the 3rd Street, Bayview Hunters Point food store would be closed. I find that a very unfortunate move. All others, except a few stores in Sacramento, will I assume, be retained, but it's just for this City very difficult to see that store be closed. And I'm not sure what recourse we have. I don't have any idea, but it is of great concern to me that the neighborhood, which really needs this type of store, is the first one to be affected. 


Commissioner Sugaya:


First, on the secretary search, are we -- President, are we thinking of having a joint hearing or no?
  


Commissioner Fong:


Likely to be a joint hearing. 


Commissioner Sugaya:


Okay. I think that would be important to hear comments back and forth from the other Commissioners. Secondly, a new exhibit has opened up at the California Historical Society, SPUR, the San Francisco Public Library, the College of Environmental Design Archives in Berkeley, maybe one other venue. It's called Unbuilt San Francisco and it's an exhibit of those kinds of visionary or maybe not so visionary projects that have been proposed for San Francisco and the Bay Area. There is a really interesting and gorgeous model at the California Historical Society of a project that was proposed in Marin called the Marin Cello and it was -- if you're driving to Marin from the City and you go through the tunnel, if you can vision everything from that hillside over to the ocean was proposed for development. And I don't know how long – I don't know who kept the model. 
 
It's at least 8 by 8 or some huge dimension like that. But it's been kept all these years since I guess the '50s is maybe when it was proposed, in the '60s. And I think it's now in the possession of GGNRA, but I'm not sure. There wasn't a label on it that said who was in possession of it, but it's really interesting to see. There are other visions for the Ferry Building area. Of course, models of the Jewish Museum that's part of the Jesse Street Substation, a ballet building that was proposed for where the Four Seasons is now. And over at SPUR, there are more planning oriented exhibits. So, it's well worth going and it's free, so, that's all I have.

Director’s Announcements


                


Director Rahaim: 


Commissioners, welcome back from break, ready for a busy fall. Just two announcements, I wanted to let you know pleased to let you know Corey Teague is the new Assistant Zoning Administrator. You know Corey from having worked in the Department for several years. He will be working directly under Scott Sanchez as the ZA and will fill in for Scott as Scott is away or as other needs arise. And as you know Dan Sider has accepted a different position in the Department as well. So, Corey fills in for Dan or takes over the position that Dan Sider had in that role. Secondly, I think you all got a memo from me yesterday, copy of a memo I sent to the Board regarding some new public outreach that we're doing related to development projects. We're happy to talk about that in more detail, but I did want to let you know that -- and I will give you more details as we -- as they are developed. But on October 2nd and October 5th we will be having a series of meetings in the Potrero Hill and Dogpatch Neighborhoods on development in that part of town. Supervisor Cohen is sponsoring those meetings. That's a Wednesday evening and Saturday morning. We will be talking about development in that area and talking, kind of a refresher, if you will, about Eastern Neighborhoods, which is now five years since it's been adopted.
  
And talking about that plan and how these projects are or are not consistent with that plan and giving more information to the community about how they can get involved in the process. So, those are coming up on the second and the fifth of October. And that concludes my presentation. Thank you.

Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission


 


BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:


 


LAND USE COMMITTEE:
  


·
         
3
rd
 St. FR.
  
At Monday’s Land Use hearing the Committee heard Supervisor Cohen’s Ordinance that would establish the 3rd Street Formula Retail Restricted Use District.
  
This Commission heard that Ordinance on July 25, 2013 and voted unanimously for approval with modifications.
  
The Supervisor included all of the Commission recommendations
[1]
 but did not expand the RUD to include properties along Lane Street, which the Commission had recommended she look into including (if they ask, the Supervisor’s office looked at the properties but decided that since they did no face 3rd Street and did not have store fronts it was not necessary to include them in the RUD).
  
Because some substantive changes were made to the Ordinance the day of the hearing, the Ordinance had to be continued to the following week.
  
There were no questions by members of the Committee and no public comment on the item.
  
The Ordinance is expected to pass out of next week’s Committee hearing with a favorable recommendation to the Board.




·
         
The Land Use Committee considered a Planning Commission-initiated ordinance for hotels in certain SoMa districts.
  
This ordinance would amend Section 842 ttoallow a tourist hotel of any size, on parcels in the MUO zoning district with a height designation of 105’ or higher via CU.
  
Under the existing controls for the MUO zoning district, only hotels with fewer than 75 rooms could be approved with Conditional Use authorization.
   
After a brief presentation by an attorney representing the proposed 137-room hotel project at 144 King Street (which had been approved prior to the adoption of the Eastern Neighborhoods Area Plan),
 the Committee forwarded the item to the full Board with a recommendation.

BOARD OF APPEALS:


The Board of Appeals did meet last night. They had two hearings since the Commission went on recess and last night they met. Nothing of interest to report, but at the hearing on August 21st there were two items. The first being 865 El Camino Del Mar, also known as 132nd Avenue, and it was the DR that the Planning Commission has heard several times over the course of the years. This was -- this item had been heard previously, but continued to allow additional time to review the heights and ensure compliance with the heights. The Board on that item unanimously upheld the issuance of the permit and the hearing the Planning Commission did not take DR on this item. 
 
The second item, 3166 16
th
 Street, which is a building permit application to establish a retail use known as Jack Spade, this item had a lengthy hearing. It was a jurisdiction request on a letter of determination. The previous week which the Board had denied on this one, the Board voted 3 to 2 to overturn the permit, to deny the permit. However, four votes are required, a super majority, in order to overturn a permit so the permit was in effect granted. There has been a rehearing request filed on this permit and I believe that's scheduled for hearing on October 9th.

At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.
  
With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.
  
When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.
  
Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes. 


 


The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.
  
In response to public comment, the commission is limited to: 


 


(1)
  
responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or


(2)

 1.
       
Revise the proposed District boundaries so that the proposed RUD includes all properties from Williams Avenue to Paul Avenue that face Third Street and are not zoned NC, as show in the attached map, Exhibit A.


2.
         
Revise the Ordnance so that the proposed RUD is subject to the same controls as all other Formula Retail establishments in the City. ((To address the Supe’s concern the Commission recommended changing controls citywide to require that a Formula Retail operator would have to seek CU authorization if they purchase an existing Formula Retail business and operate it as a new business, regardless of whether or not the entire business was purchased or only some locations.))


3.
         
Revise Planning Code Section 303(i) to reflect the changes outlined in Exhibit B.


4.
         
Consider including the properties that front on Lane Street between Yosemite Street and Armstrong Avenue.
