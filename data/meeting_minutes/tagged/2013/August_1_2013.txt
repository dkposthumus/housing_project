Commissioner Antonini:


I have a few items, in light of the concert last Friday night with Jay Z and Justin Timberlake at the Candlestick; I am still questioning whether or not it's advisable for the City to demolish Candlestick after the 49ers are no longer playing there. 
 
I don't know what the maintenance costs would be per year, but obviously, there are other uses that a stadium, if it where maintained adequately, could take part, in that facility, and again by doing this, it puts us in a position where we no longer have a venue that seats 60,000 plus so and there are certain events that require that, so, we again we will be losing revenue to other sites. 
 
It's just something I wanted to get an opinion on from staff and also the whole nature of Prop G where, there was to have been a $100,000,000 put into new a stadium, which is not happening at Hunters Point, but I wondered what happens with that money that was part of the a preconditions for the developer to be able to develop Hunters Point and Candlestick Point.
  
It would seem like that money still has to be spent to some kind of use that involves a stadium. So those are some questions for the future. I also heard recently that we are now requiring conditional uses for existing parking lots citywide. I knew that was some of that occurring down around AT&T Park,
  
but from a couple of people, have questioned, when this came about and when it became citywide and what the thinking is and also, so I would like to hear
  
an answer on that, maybe not today, but I would like to find out. Because I don't remember anything coming before us, obviously it may have be an administrative code, but it would come before us, for their CU’s. These are existing lots these are not lots that would be new, from what the public is asking me, over every few years they would have to come for a conditional use or at least once to have their use continued in its present form, unless they are non-conforming at that particular time, I am not sure of the whole nature of that question. Another question is on design review, as we will read later on our report on the Port.
  
The Port
  
- - the BCDC has a function of design review, according
  
to the report that is coming up later on Port properties and we know in the Presidio there's a body probably the Presidio Trust, or a part of the Presidio Trust that has a design review and we do not really have a design review per say, we have -
  
it comes before the Planning Commission, but often times the design is pretty well put together by the time it comes to us and 
 
often times we go through many hearings and a lot of changes that have to occur
  
and I'd like to know if there's a way we could see designs a little earlier in the process and get a comment because while much of what's been built 
 
has been very good, there are some projects in my opinion, that don't look very good and look very cheaply built, and it is a little too late to do it when they are already built.
  
Then Rincon Hill, John King had an article in yesterday's Chronicle and it was well written and describes all the building that is going on. One particular property he said is still in design approval and I'm sure that may be, but I think the permit’s has been pulled on this happened to be 399 Fremont, but I guess, if they haven't begun construction it could be that even though the permit has been pulled they are still undergoing some design review, I thought this was pretty much finished and it was ready to go, but ah - anyway, that is what he put that in the paper, which does not
  
necessarily
  
mean and I don't know if Director Rahaim has any information?


 


Director Rahaim:


Typically what happens Commissioner, when you approve a project there is a standard condition that requires developers to continue to work with staff on refining the design. There are typically two permits that then we review. One is the site permit and we sign off on the site permit before DBI can issue it, and the second package that we review is called the architectural addenda which is, that is were a lot of the details of the design is worked out so it could be that the site permit was issued, but not the permit that would be associated with the architectural addenda.


 


Commissioner Antonini:


Thank you, I just happened to be walking by there and saw they’d already pulled the permit, but that answers my question and it looks like Mr. King is accurate in his status for that. And then finally on the Secretary Search Sub- Committee, there was a meeting held yesterday, unfortunately in my opinion, we have had to continue this matter until September 11
th
 on procedural matters and again my apologizes to everyone that it is taking a long time. But you can’t do too much about it, I think President Fong may have some comments and issues surrounding the procedural issues. 


Commissioner Sugaya:


I have a request for the Commission to adjourn today's meeting in memory of Alice Carey. She was the founder of Carey and Co., which is an architecture firm here in San Francisco. Started it in 1983 at her dining table, instead of a garage, and built her practice and through the years and got a big break in 1991, when she was awarded to be the preservation architect for all of the Civic Center buildings here, that were damaged in the Loma Prieta Earthquake. So her practice really took off then and included the Opera House obviously, and City Hall. Other notable civic projects include the State Library and Court buildings in Sacramento, and the State Capitol, where we still continuing do work. You won't be able to see much of it, because it all has to do with mechanic systems and fan rooms, as they are called.
  
Here in the City, the firm was the Preservation Architects for the Palace of Fine Arts and Noe Valley Library and she also gave time to the City that she really loved. In 1988 she was appointed by the Mayor Agnos, at that time, to be a member of what was called the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board, which is now morphed into the Historic Preservation Commission.
  
I was on that Board on that time; we tried not to give Kate Stacy too much problems. Kate was our City Attorney at that time.
  
She was also on the Board of San Francisco Beautiful, the S.F. CORK Sister City Committee and as a neighborhood advocate formed what was called The Rincon Tenacious Tenants on Guy Place in the Rincon Neighborhood. They affectionately called it Rin Ten Ten. Despite that, she was appointed to be a member of the Rincon Point South Beach Advisory Committee, so maybe some neighborhood activism does you some good. She was really most proud of her work at City Hall, so if you walk through the building and observe it from the outside it’s pretty much the way it had been since the rehabilitation took place in early 1990s. She was almost proud of the Old Engine Company Number 2, which is an old fire station at 460 Bush Street. 
 
The offices of the firm are in the building and I think she also tried to point out that she was able to use all of the historic preservation incentives that are available for people and owners to rehabilitate their buildings and that include the Federal Historic Tax Credit Program, which returned 20% in credits, using of the State Historical Building Code. She was, I think, one of the first owners to obtain a Mills Act Contract with the City, which lowers your property tax rate and then she also has a façade, which is called a façade easement, that I believe, is under the control now of San Francisco Heritage. And I think for all of you who have ever seen a French maroon Deux Cheveau, I think, that is what they’re called, running around the City that was Alice. I don't know if Richard Stacey still has his or not, but this was a distinctive little car that I think people wondered, what is that? 


 


Commissioner Fong:


Sorry to hear that, and thank you for that nice bio. 


 


Commissioner Moore:


You had a comment in response. 


 


Commissioner Fong
:


I want to just follow up on Commissioner Antonini’s comment about the Search Committee for the secretary role and if Kate Stacey wants to correct me on anything here, feel free to.
  
But I just want to clarify, going back in time, first of all, I want to thank everyone for their effort and their time to sit on the committee, Commissioners Borden, Moore and Antonini, It has been a time effort. But I want to clarify going back, I believe that I and this Commission agreed that we were going to select this subcommittee with the equal members from this Commission and the Historic Preservation Commission and that Subcommittee was going to vet potential candidates, interview them and then make a recommendation back to this full Commission, and that hopefully this full Commission would accept that recommendation and proceed forward. So, I just want to make clear that, that was the intent of this Commission some months back.


 


Kate Stacey, City Attorney’s Office:


President Fong, Kate Stacey from the City Attorney's Office. So just to clarify, it is your intent that the Committee makes a recommendation as a whole, so all six of the members would make one recommendation, as one Committee.


 


President Fong:


That is correct.


Commissioner Moore:


I want to first acknowledge the passing of Alice Carey, who will be sorely missed as a person and as a professional. The legacy of her achievements are around us sitting in this building and having enjoyed this superb historic preservation is just one example of the many things we enjoy in the exquisite nature of historic preservation in the City. So I look forward to closing in her memory, for all us tonight. On another matter, I had a very interesting article, which I will pass around. Perhaps you can all look at it. There is the San Francisco Giants planned the first ever edible garden on the outfield of an American major sports facility. It is well designed. It has a lovely story to it. I don't know baseball enough and I do not if there are conflicting land uses, if a baseball heats a tomato or whatever would be, but the idea was very powerful, because the facility sits around with a huge amount of land and doing it this way, I think, speaks for all of the things that we all share and feel proud of. So, I want to pass this around. While we normally don't 
 
comment on commissioners I'd like to conversationally add that the Port has a design review, which is filled by six registered architects, highly competent and very well suited group to comment and guide the design of the Port’s projects. 


 


Commissioner Sugaya:


Yes, on a more lighthearted note. I found an article in the New Yorker about a Planning Commission meeting in New York.
   
It's a little bit different than the ones we have because this one happened to have been attended by Spike Lee, Walt Frazier and Earl Monroe, sports fans, and members of the Knicks and the Rangers. I’ll pass it around. 
 
It was before the Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises - I don't know Director Rahaim, I do not know the structure of New York’s decision making, but it appears to be quiet different than ours.


 


Director Rahaim:


The one comment I would make is that the Director of the New York City Planning Department is also the Chair of the City’s Planning Commission.

Director’s Announcements


Director Rahaim:


Thank you Jonas. 
 
Commissioners, just a couple of announcements, one is, I think you may have heard that the Rincon Hill Park in front of 333 Harrison has now been made available to the public, via an arrangement that was worked out by the developer with the Parks Alliance. The developer will own and maintain the park and the Parks Alliance has a conservation easement and the park will be open during normal business hours. I think the arrangement is sunrise to sunset. That park, which had always been intended be a public space, will now be available to the public and be actually maintained by the private property owner, which is an arrangement that we had been working with the owner and the Parks Alliance. I also want to mention, in terms of Departmental personnel issues. Jose Campos who is the Director of Citywide Planning has left the Department and you may have heard this, that he left earlier this week. His new position required him to leave on fairly short notice, he’s returned to Barcelona, and in the interim Joshua Switzky will be the Acting Director of Citywide, but I will be announcing a new search for a Long Range Planning Director in the next few weeks.


Commissioner Moore:


Director Rahaim, you probably did not mean to say that you will be searching for a new Planning Director.


Commissioner Moore:


No, I am not searching for my replacement; I am searching for a new Director of Citywide Planning.

Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission


            
 


LAND USE COMMITTEE:
  


·
         
The Land Use Committee heard, a Planning Code amendment introduced by Supervisor Avalos that would amend the controls that address the loss of dwelling units through demolition, conversion, and merger, as well as to amend the way that alterations to nonconforming units are limited in the Planning Code.
  
At the hearing, the item was continued to the Call of the Chair at the request of Supervisor Avalos.
  
He wanted to introduce substitute legislation on Tuesday to split the file.
  
The Planning Commission considered the item on July 18, 2013.
  
The Commission was supportive of the proposed amendments to the demolition controls, and had requested additional time to consider the proposed amendments to Section 181, which concerns nonconforming uses.
  
The Planning Commission has calendared the nonconforming uses item (proposed amendments to Section 181) for September 19, 2013. 
 
It is anticipated that Supervisor Avalos will move forward with the changes to demolition controls after the Board’s august break and that he will wait to hear from the Commission after you 9/19 hearing.




·
         
The Land Use Committee held a hearing to discuss the City’s landmark Parklet Program, administered through the Pavement to Parks at the Planning Department in coordination with the Department of Public Works and the Municipal Transportation Agency.  Paul Chasan from the Planning Department delivered an overview of the parklet program’s origins and recent notable projects.  A panel of local parklet stakeholders including designers, parklet hosts and sponsors, and nonprofit supporters presented their experiences as participants in the Parklet Program.  Craig Hollow – designer, educator, and community organizer – related his experience shepherding a parklet project through design and implementation as a youth development project with the Out of Site Youth Center in the Excelsior District.  The Committee Members posed questions related to the future of the Parklet Program.  These questions addressed issues of equity and geographic distribution throughout the City, assessing the potential impacts of parklets to car parking and economic development.  Supervisor Mar recognized the success of parklets in other neighborhoods and noted the upcoming installation of a new parklet in the Inner Richmond.  Supervisor Wiener emphasized the need for the City to not only continue, but augment, the resources allocated to the Parklet Program.
 




FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: 


HEARING


The board heard two appeals related to a proposed wireless telecommunications facility at 4216 California Street. Both the Commission’s CU authorization & the Department’s CEQA determination were appealed. The Commission had approved this CU on June 6. At that time you added additional conditions to ensure that the equipment on the ground floor was sealed from potential flood events that additional fire safety methods were implemented, and you asked that staff continue to work with the project sponsor on design modifications.
  
The appellant continued to raise issues related to the Building & Fire Codes and expressed doubt that DBI would properly implement their requirements.
  
In our response the Department explained that the Building Code & Fire Codes are not discretionary and that DBI would not approve a project until it met the requirements. During the hearing Supervisor Mar asked questions about potential flooding and battery safety.
  
Supervisor Yee asked the project sponsor if they could further raise the height of the battery casings. The project sponsor agreed to make this change.
   
The project was located in Supervisor Farrell’s district and he expressed empathy with the appellants concerns while also assuring them that he didn’t believe this project would present a public safety threat. 
The Board then voted to uphold the CEQA exemption and affirm the Commissions CU, with only Supervisor Mar voting against the motion.

BOARD OF APPEALS:


The Board of Appeals did meet last time; two items that may be interest of the Planning Commission related to the project at 706 Mission Street. The first was a jurisdiction request. The appellant in this case sought to appeal the Planning Commission’s two determinations related to the Section 295, Shadow Determinations. One was an amendment to the implementation memo that the Commissions Rec/Park and Planning developed in 1989. The second one was the actual 295 determination.
  
Under Planning Code Section 295 it does not provide for an appeal to the Board of Appeals, nor has it been considered a permit or a license, which would be appealable to the Board of Appeals. There’s a City Attorney’s opinion from 1984, which re-enforces this, so with that advice, staff at the Board of Appeals, rejected their appeal fillings. So they filed a jurisdiction request and sought that the Board essentially override their staff and accept the appeals and the Board voted unanimously to maintain their past practice, and not accept separate appeals. This would have been separate appeals in addition to appeals on the Historic Preservation Commission determination, which was unanimously upheld by the Board of Supervisors last week, as well as, the EIR, which was unanimously upheld by the Board in May and the Section 309 which was on appeal to the Board of Appeals last night, so, that was resolved. Then we heard the Section 309 appeal, which is appealable to
  
Board of Appeals, even though it’s not a permit or a license, and the Board of Appeals heard that appeal last night and unanimously upheld the Planning Commission’s decision in this matter. We do not see a lot Section 309 appeals to the Board of Appeals, another item, which is similar is the office allocations, which are appealable to the Board of Appeals, we don't see many of those either, and would note that there's a City Attorney memo from 1989, which states the Board only needs three votes to overturn a Planning Commission action, not the typical four votes on a 309 or an Office Allocation matter. So I wanted to highlight that, this is something a little bit different, because the 309 nor the office allocation is a permit or a license, and under the charter a permit or a license also a ZA determinations and variances all those have to have 4 votes, and it says that in the charter you have to have four votes to overturn, but 309’s and the Office Allocations are not addressed in the Charter, so they just say a simple majority under the City Attorney’s opinion from 1989.
  
So, I'll inform the Board of that because we do not get a lot of those appeals, it is something a little bit different.

 STREET (HAYSTON APARTMENT BUILDING) AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH GROUND-FLOOR RETAIL PROJECT DRAFT EIR
 - Southwest corner of 6
th
 and Howard Streets; Assessor’s Block 3731, Lot 001 
 - 
Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report
. 
The proposed project includes demolition of the existing four-story vacant building at 200-214 6
th
 Street, removal of the temporary art installation on the existing building, and construction of a new, nine-story mixed-use building, with sixty-seven affordable housing units and ground floor commercial space. The project site is located in the SOMA NCT (Neighborhood Commercial Transit) Zoning District and an 85-X Height and Bulk District. The Final EIR concluded that implementation of the 200-214 6
th
 Street Affordable Housing with Ground-Floor Retail project would result in significant unavoidable environmental impacts related to historic resources since the proposed project would involve the demolition of the Hayston Apartment Building which has been identified as a contributing structure to the 6
th
 Street Lodginghouse District, a National Register eligible historic district.


Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the Final Environmental Impact Report.


NOTE: The public hearing on the Draft EIR is closed. The public comment period for the Draft EIR ended on
