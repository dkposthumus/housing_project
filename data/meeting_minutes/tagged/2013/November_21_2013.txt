Commissioner Antonini:


Thank you. I just returned from my first trip to New Orleans, and unfortunately I couldn’t bring home a 49ers victor, but there were some things I noticed there. There are a lot of similarities between our two cities particularly in terms of tourism, and I saw virtually no graffiti, trash, no one sleeping in doorways or on the street, in my entire visit to New Orleans. We didn’t just stay in the French Quarter we went to all parts of the city including seeing some of the devastation from Katrina. There was only one panhandler that verbally asked for money in the five days that I was there. There was a huge convention of the American Association of Ophthalmologists, so obviously there were a lot of people there that were from out of town. A couple of other things that was impressive, the parks were closed between 10:00 PM and 6:00 AM and it is posted on all the parks, which I believe we started to take some steps in that direction. They have a lot of streetcars, in addition to the famous St. Charles Streetcar, which most people know about it. They’ve got a lot of streetcars on Canal Street and other locations, including the waterfront and their historic streetcars as we have here in San Francisco. They're extremely well run and very successful and it's something that we should look at as to extensions of the ones we do have to areas of the City, because people enjoy riding them. It's not so much just to get to a place, but it’s the manner in which you get there. They are very popular and the other thing that is there, which is very successful is the Superdome and the basketball arena right next to it and it was really refreshing to come out of football game, 70 thousand people and probably, 68 thousand of them were on foot. I mean, there probably is a little bit of parking to the north there, but most people come to New Orleans stay overnight and attend the games in that manner. So, it's unfortunate we will not have an arena – or we may have an arena for basketball, but probably not for the next thirty years, will we have a football stadium in the downtown area of San Francisco. It was an enjoyable trip, and the other thing I noted, the restaurants do extremely well, as you might expect, they have large conventions there, but they actually have some dress codes, which is refreshing to see, for a change, and three of the four restaurants we dined at, men had to wear a sports coat when they were there. These weren't high-end places they were sort of middle of the road type of places, but there’s a certain decorum that they have, that we have lost over the last few years. Otherwise I'm glad to be back, the heat and humidity; even in November is a little tough to take.

Director’s Announcements


                


DIRECTOR RAHAIM:


Just one announcement today Commissioners, I wanted to let you know about, we have released the final Administrative Draft of the Recreation Open Space Element of the General Plan. We've been working back and forth with several stake holder groups. That was released two days ago and we will be getting you copies.
  
We anticipate that we will come to you next month to initiate the process and we are looking at roughly a February time frame for action after several other public meetings and hearings at the Recreation and Park Commission. And related to that, there will be an open house on December the 4th from 5:30 -7:30 PM at the LGBT Center on Market Street. That will be a joint open house, for the ROSE, the Recreation Open Space Element and the Green Connections Project, which has also been finalized recently. Those two projects together, will be the subject of that open house, again, December 4th from 5:30-7:30 PM at the LGBT Center which is at 1800 Market Street. That concludes my announcements.

Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission


 


LAND USE COMMITTEE:
  
None 


FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: 


·
         
Supervisor Avalos’s Outer Mission NCD was approved on FINAL read.
  
This Commission heard the item in April of this year and recommended approval with modifications. The new NCD would replace existing minimum parking requirements with maximum parking controls, prohibit fringe financial services, offer a 5’ height bonus for active uses and institute a buffer between medical cannabis dispensaries. If you recall, the most controversial aspect of this ordinance was prohibiting new MCDs from locating within 500 feet of an existing MCD.
  
The Commission’s substantive recommendation was to require Conditional Use for MCDs within 500 of another MCD, rather than banning them outright.
  
The Supervisor integrated all of the Commission’s recommendations into the revised Ordinance.
  
  


·
         
Also at the Board was Supervisor Avalos’s Ordinance that would direct the Planning Commission to submit a report to the Board of Supervisors evaluating the Planning Code controls for medical cannabis dispensaries. 
 
This ordinance would require the report to be delivered to the Board by Jan 1, 2014.
  
Although this ordinance is not yet law, we’ve known about Supervisor Avalos’ request since early this summer. As such, Planning staff
  
have already started the report and have tentatively reserved space on the Commission’s
  
12/5 agenda. At the Board hearing this week Supervisor Campos expressed concern that this important issue needs more time for outreach—and he amended the ordinance to change the report deadline to May 1
st
, while also emphasizing that the Commission could submit a report earlier if appropriate
  
This item was approved on FINAL READ with the amended date.
  
Staff is working to bring this report forward to the Commission in January.

Hearing on Rodework & Infrastructure Oversight.
  
Hearing directed to the Department of Public Works, Municipal Transportation Agency, Public Utilities Commission, and Pacific Gas and Electric Company to explore a number of issues, including which projects are occurring where, including sewer, water, natural gas, and road resurfacing, and what the benefits of these infrastructure improvements are; how the projects are coordinated to comply with the City's mandate that once a road is resurfaced that no work will be done for 5 years -- absent an emergency -- to minimize repetitive street disruption; why some blocks remain under construction for very extended periods of time, with on-again-off-again work and repetitive digging; how blocks are chosen in terms of scheduling work; how many blocks are worked on annually and what the future schedule looks like; how departments are minimizing disruptions to the public caused by road work (parking, traffic detours, noise, dust, etc.); how contractors are held accountable for completing work in a timely manner,
  
complying with contractual requirements, delivering high quality work, and minimizing impacts on surrounding neighbors; why some blocks, after undergoing utility work, only get paved on one side of the street and what we can do to prevent this; why it takes so long for MTA to re-stripe repaved roads, often months after the repaving is complete; how the various projects are funded and what the cost is per block; what our goals are for improving pavement conditions.

Interim Zoning Controls - Building Permits for Commercial Buildings in an Area Bounded by Market, Second, Brannan, Division, and South Van Ness Streets.

[1]
: 1) certain building permits for commercial buildings shall require the posting of a notice and a 15-day delay in starting the work; and 2) the re-establishment of a commercial use that has been converted to residential use shall require Planning Commission approval through either an authorization under Planning Code, Section 320, Annual Office Limit. or a CU authorization Kim.


 


BOARD OF APPEALS:


The Board of Appeals met last night and heard one case of interest to the Planning Commission. 


Large Project Authorization for 480 Potrero Avenue (6-stories, 75 DUs, 47 parking spaces):


o
   
MND appealed to Planning Commission;


o
   
MND upheld by PC on August 8, 2013;


o
   
LPA approved by PC on August 8, 2013;


o
   
MND appealed to Board of Supervisors;


o
   
MND upheld by Board of Supervisors on October 22, 2013;


o
   
Appellants made same arguments at Board of Appeals as they did at the Planning Commission hearing;


o
   
Two Commissioners were recused due to conflicts of interest;


o
   
Board of Appeals upheld the LPA on a 3-0 vote.


 


The Board was also scheduled to hold what was assumed to be its third and final hearing for a building permit at 68 Presidio Ave to expand its existing roof deck and make other minor improvements. However, the appeal was withdrawn a few hours before the hearing. The Planning Commission may find this interesting because the appellants for this case also filed a request for Discretionary Review for this project, but withdrew that request the day of the hearing. 


HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:


Commissioners Tim Frye, Department staff, here to share with you the outcome of yesterday’s Historic Preservation Commission hearing. The HPC granted a Certificate of Appropriateness for 333 Dolores Street, at the Notre Dame School, Landmark number 37, this was to allow for 3 temporary classrooms to remain on the grounds for ten and a half years until the children’s day school, can expand to their new location at 601 Dolores Street. The temporary structures also require approval through Conditional Use Authorization by this Commission and you'll see that item at a future date. The Commission also unanimously approved to reclassify the St. Mary’s Rectory at 660 California Street, from an unrated building to a contributory building under Article 11 of the Planning Code. The building is clad primarily in red brick and cast concrete, it's a four-story structure designed in an early modern-contextual style
  
by Chuck Bassett of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. The building was completed in 1966. Aside from meeting the criteria for reclassification, the building fulfills one of the goals of the Historic Preservation Commission’s Work Program in recognizing significant representations of the modern movement. And the final decision on that reclassification will be before the Board of Supervisor at a future date, likely early next year.
  
Also, I wanted to give you a quick update on the Filbert Street Cottages. As you know, this Commission and the HPC approved a major rehabilitation of those cottages a couple years ago. As you know, the work has stopped at the site. We met with the project sponsor at the site on Monday and they are waiting for the outcome of pending legal action regarding the project.
  
As a result the project team’s working on a short term and a long term maintenance and rehabilitation plan that also can include some security measures for the property. We're hoping that work can commence shortly, but I wanted to let you know, we're working closely with the Project Architect to make sure that the site remains in good standing and we'll keep you posted on the outcome of their progress. And finally, last week, I gave a brief presentation at the Graffiti Advisory Board; the Board mainly had questions and comments regarding the Planning Department’s review procedures, and the HPC’s review procedures regarding graffiti abatement on landmark properties. The Board is -- essentially trying to find ways to require victims of the graffiti vandalism to report those crimes to the SFPD. We along with the Commission reiterated our willingness to work with the Board on finding ways to collaborate more closely and we will start discussions with DPW on better coordination and also keep you updated on that progress. That concludes my comments.
