Future Meetings/Agendas

At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.


 


Commissioner Antonini
:


The first item is, that I am scheduled to undergo a surgical procedure in January, on the 16
th
, which means I will not be in attendance on that particular day, and there is a chance I may not be here on the 23
rd
, and it would difficult to change the schedule on that procedure, so I just wanted to give adequate notice to those, who may have projects and may want me to be in attendance or want to have a full Commission for at least the 16
th
 and possibly the 23
rd
.
  
On another item, I'd like to recognize that tomorrow
  
would be
  
my father’s one hundredth
  
birthday and he served as a Planning Commissioner for ten years in Pleasanton and I think
  
they did a very good job out there, if any of you have ever had
  
the opportunity to visit that little
  
town. They were one of the few small towns in the East Bay that was able to keep their downtown “Main Street,”
  
and while much of the businesses, as is the case in suburbia, takes place in shopping centers outside of the main street, the main street itself is still very pleasant and is a site of a lot of parades and various
  
things and the other thing they did quite well there, is they made some good improvements over the years and eliminated some buildings that had been built in the 50’s not of the best quality and replaced them with buildings that nicely…that are in context with the more historical buildings be they masonry or be they
  
wood framed. For those who are afraid of false historicism, I think you should take a ride out there sometime to see how nicely these buildings fit in with the actual historic buildings and you can tell which the newer ones are, but you know, it gives it a very nice appearance and it's something that people like and certainly looks better than having some starkly modern buildings sandwiched in this historic Main Street. In any case, I just wanted to recognize my father’s contributions and recognize his birthday. Unfortunately, he passed away 9 years ago, but he did make it to 91 and I think he set a good example for me for what he did in service to his community.


 


Commissioner Sugaya:


Unless I missed it, there is an article in today’s paper about the Waterfront Transportation Assessment Zone, if we can get an status report on that, it was in in the paper. It was something about an assessment going on - for water transportation all up and down…


 


Director Rahaim:


You mean the work that Peter Albert is doing. 


 


Commissioner Sugaya:


Did we hear that sometime ago?


 


Director Rahaim:


We did, but we can certainly give you and update.


 


Commissioner Sugaya:


Yes. If there's any kind of update. It’s just rolling along. 


 


Commissioner Wu:


Thanks, yesterday the Mayor issued a Mayoral Executive Directive, about the development and preservation of affordable housing. So, I assume at some point staff will tell us how that will be implemented within the Planning Department.


 


Commissioner Moore
: 


Another bright light along the same lines, we all received an e-mail from Community Housing Partnership about the opening of the Rene Cazenave Apartments, I'm sure I’m not pronouncing this correctly, Director Rahaim is chuckling, opening of a hundred-twenty unit of affordable housing in the former Transbay Redevelopment Area, designed by Leddy Maytum Stacy Architects, exceptional building originally conceived under Redevelopment, but definitely an example of what we want to do. You should click through the pictures, it is quite beautiful and I was really happy to get that news this morning.

Director’s Announcements


                


Director Rahaim:


A couple of things, you had asked a couple of weeks ago about the status of the review Environmental Impact Report of the Academy of Arts University. We are moving ahead with that and I'm planning, at your request, to schedule a date in February for an informational update. We are anticipating that the draft
  
will be out in the summer, it is…we are making progress, we are making slower progress than I would like, but we are making progress on that EIR
  
as we move forward. Secondly, in your packet today, I think in you r packet is Annual Report for the Department from the last fiscal year.
  
I ask you to take a look at that and if you have any questions or comments on that, I would appreciate it, staff has put together this report, I think it is, I think we are improving the format, I think it is, it highlights some of the key projects of the year, this particular report we highlighted some of the Historic Preservation work of the past year, since we declared two new Historic Districts, you, the HPC, and the Board of Supervisors, designated two new Historic Districts this past year, for the first time in many, many years. We're proud of that work. Thirdly, I wanted to give you a copy of the Mayor’s Executive Directive from yesterday that does affects the Department. I just wanted to spend a couple of minutes on that, if I might. The Executive Directive is intended to prioritize the development of new housing and to protect the City’s existing rental stock. It establishes a working group, that I'll talk about in a second. The group is comprised of Department heads including myself, it will be chaired by the Director of the Department of Building Inspection and will include the Fire Department, and the Rent Board, and the Mayor's Office of Housing. On an as needed basis, it will also include representatives of property owner organizations, tenant organizations and nonprofit housing organizations and staff potentially from Public Works, OCII, the PUC and the City Administrator’s Office. The Directive really charges this group in doing three things. One is to make recommendations to the Mayor for City policies to preserve and promote rental housing; the second is to look at a process to expand,
  
sorry -- the second is to expand the potential for Commission Discretionary Reviews when any loss of a unit or any displacement of a tenant is involved in a project; and the third is to act as an advisory body for municipal departments with permitting authority and as a clearing house for code compliance checks for buildings that are being withdrawn from the rental market. I'm happy to get into more details at a future hearing about this, I wanted to give you this report today. Mr. Hui as the Director of DBI has set up the first meeting
  
in January of this working group, so as we get more involved in the details I'll report back to you. Thank you.

Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission


 


 


BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:


            
 


BUDGET COMMITTEE:
  


·
         
On Monday, the Budget Committee held a special hearing to consider 10 Mills Act Contracts.
  
The Historic Preservation Commission has considered recommended approval of all of the contracts to better enable preservation and upkeep of the properties. Planning staff worked closely with the Assessor’s staff and the Budget Analyst to ensure the contracts could be considered by the Board before the end of the year.
  
The Committee recommended approval to the Full Board and the Board approved the contracts at their Tuesday hearing.
  
This provides an opportunity for the contracts to be in place for the 2014 tax year.


 


 




 




FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: 


·
         
On Tuesday the Board passed two Ordinances introduced by Supervisor Avalos on final reading. 
The two ordinances would 1) amend the criteria for the evaluation of loss of dwelling units, 2) create an opportunity to expand and alter legal nonconforming units, and 3) consolidate repetitive and similar code sections related to the loss of dwelling units by moving all criteria for evaluation into Section 317.
  
The amended ordinances would also respond to Ellis Act evictions as follows:
  
While the ordinance would generally expand opportunities for legal, nonconforming units, there would be a prohibition on approving the loss of dwellings through a unit merger if the unit had been the subject of a no-fault eviction. The eviction would have had to occur after 12/10/13.
  
This prohibition would be in place for 10 years for an Ellis Act eviction and five years for an owner move-in eviction. 
The vote at Tuesday’s Board hearing was 11-0.


·
         
The Cottage Food Ordnance was also approved on final reading. 
This ordinance would amend the Planning Code to allow Cottage Food operations as an accessory use to residential units.
  
It would also increase the allowable floor area for accessory uses from ¼ to 1/3 of the floor area and standardized accessory use controls for residential units in all zoning districts
[1]
.
 


 


INTRODUCTIONS:


·
         
131205 Production, Distribution, and Repair Zoning.
  
This is an ordinance will make various amendments to production, distribution and repair (or PDR) uses as well as integrated PDR uses and small enterprise workplace zoning controls.
  
This ordinance was introduced by the Mayor, Supervisors Cohen and Campos.


 


Yesterday the Mayor released an Executive Directive intended to prioritize the development of new housing and to protect the City’s existing rental stock.
  
This ED established a Working Group tasked with three responsibilities. The Working Group is comprised of department heads including me and the Directors of DBI, Fire, Rent Board and Mayor’s Office of Housing. On an “as needed” basis this group will also include a representative of a property owners organization, a tenant organization, a nonprofit housing org, another housing org and possibility staff from DPW, OCII, PUC, and CAO.
  


The three tasks of this group include:

SAN FRANCISCO GROUNDWATER SUPPLY PROJECT
 - 
Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report
 - The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) is proposing the San Francisco Groundwater Supply Project (Groundwater Supply Project), which would provide an average of up to 4 million gallons per day of groundwater to augment San Francisco’s municipal water supply. All of the proposed groundwater well facilities would supply groundwater to existing reservoirs, where it would be blended with San Francisco’s existing municipal water supply before distribution within the city. All project components would be located on the west side of San Francisco on land owned by the City and County of San Francisco. The well facilities would be managed by the SFPUC, including those located on land currently managed by the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department. The proposed Groundwater Supply Project is one of several projects that the SFPUC proposes to implement under the SFPUC’s Water System Improvement Program to meet system objectives and service goals.

SAN FRANCISCO GROUNDWATER SUPPLY PROJECT
 - Lot 001 in Assessor’s Block 1700 and lot 004 in Assessor’s Block 7283 - 
Request for Coastal Zone Permit Authorization
 pursuant to Section 330 of the Planning Code - The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) is proposing the San Francisco Groundwater Supply Project (Groundwater Supply Project), which would provide an average of up to 4 million gallons per day of groundwater to augment San Francisco’s municipal water supply. All of the proposed groundwater well facilities would supply groundwater to existing reservoirs, where it would be blended with San Francisco’s existing municipal water supply before distribution within the city. All project components would be located on the west side of San Francisco on land owned by the City and County of San Francisco. Three of the sites (two at the west end of Golden Gate Park and one at Lake Merced) are located within the Coastal Zone and require the Planning Commission to adopt findings 
per Planning Code Section 330.5.2
, that the project is consistent or not consistent with the Western Shoreline Area Plan (Local Coastal Program) of the City’s General Plan.
  
The well facilities would be managed by the SFPUC, including those located on land currently managed by the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department. The proposed Groundwater Supply Project is one of several projects that the SFPUC proposes to implement under the SFPUC’s Water System Improvement Program to meet system objectives and service goals. 
The three proposed project sites are located within the Coastal Zone, per Zoning Map Sheet CZ13 and CZ5, the P (Public) Zoning District and the OS (Open Space) Height and Bulk District. The Planning Commission’s action on the Coastal Zone Permit is appealable to the California Coastal Commission pursuant to California Public Resources Code Section 30603(a)(5) because the Groundwater Supply Project is a major public works project. 


Preliminary Recommendation: Approve Coastal Zone Permit.

 A cottage food operation, unlike other types of commercial food facilities, can be operated out of a home kitchen . This commission voted on on November 21 to recommend approval to the Board.
  
At the hearing Supervisor Chiu mentioned sponsoring an Ordinance that would create a 1-year waiver for the 1- time $133 Cottage Food Operations referral fee to the Planning Department.
  
The Department expressed support for such an idea, as it would allow the Department to evaluate the impact the waiver would have on our budget.
  
So far this year, the Department reviewed 21 Cottage Food Operation referrals, for a total amount of $2,793.
  
Should the number of applications next year be similar to this year, the Department believes that the impact on our budget will be minimal and can be covered by our existing revenue.
  
After that discussion, the committee sent the ordinance to the full board as a committee report with a recommendation for approval.
