, pursuant to Planning Code Sections 178, 303 and 304, to modify conditions of approval of a Planned Unit Development (PUD) located at 901 California Street (d.b.a Stanford Court Hotel) within the RM-4 (Residential, Mixed, High Density) Zoning District, the Nob Hill Special Use District, and 65-A and 320-E Height and Bulk District.  Motion 6241 permitted a hotel with incidental commercial uses and professional offices and conditioned that 100 parking spaces be provided within an existing garage located at 875 California Street, converting it entirely to parking for the hotel.  The Project Sponsor is asking for a modification under Planning Code Section 304 to reduce the parking provided for the hotel to seven spaces, providing it in the hotel’s existing porte cochere. A separate Conditional Use Authorization application, 2013.1130C, is being sought to reclassify the garage at 875 California Street as a community parking garage use.

Commissioner Antonini:


A couple of observations in regards to the vote on Tuesday. And, you know, while I was 

        disappointed in the result I was not commenting so much on the result regarding Measures B and C, but rather that a vote even took place. As most of you know who follow the Planning Commission, that particular project and what it has been through, 10 years if you count the original presentation of the project, and at least 7 years on this, and also a study on addressing particularly height and a lot of other things. I think in fairness to the voters it's very hard to vote on a complicated issue like this, based on sound bites and for someone really to understand the whole issue is quite difficult and that is why, if there is going to be a vote on issues in the future, hopefully it will occur at the beginning of the process not at the end. Because, if a developer or anyone who hopes to invest in San Francisco, is faced with the possibility that they may go through years of approval processes, of carefully crafted projects and lots of benefits given to the City and still be, even -- after court actions, be subject to a vote, it could quickly turn around our economy that seems to be moving very well at the present time, as we'll hear from the Commerce & Industry Inventory later on.
  
But, even in that measure there are some points that some of the things can be better and certainly we've seen our economy go south really quickly in the past, in the 80s and also in the first part of this century. And often times, in most, many instances it's the political process not the desirability of San Francisco that turns away people who are interested in our City. I would like to find out, it's not a Planning issue, but what the level of votes are needed to put a referendum on the ballot,
  
if
  
that is the appropriate,
  
if that needs to be something that we have to look at in the future. One other thing, there was a very good editorial in the San Francisco Business Times last week, and it dealt with --
  
basically it dealt with a particular possible future project,
  
but the point it made is, the opponents to this and other projects,
  
have said we only want affordable housing and that is kind of unrealistic point of view to take, because funding has to come from somewhere and to have a very beneficial project, much of the money that is generated from it, will go towards affordable housing, but it does not make sense economically for anyone, even
  
non-profits or government to be able to fund something that doesn't have some profit end to it. So I would recommend you read that editorial, I think it is quite good.


 
Commissioner Sugaya: 


A couple of things, can we have a status report on the Academy of Art at some point in the very near future?, because after a hia -- some pointed activity that took place involving the City Attorney's Office, etc., and some deadlines that were established earlier this year we haven't heard anything to date so if we could get a status report that would be great. Also to staff I'd like to know the history of reporting on below market rate units at 901 Bush Street. I believe when that went condominium there are one or two BMR units in there, and I assume there's some kind of reporting mechanism that is supposed to take place to make sure that those are actually BMR, so could we look into that.
  
I just can't resist, I don't think the San Francisco economy is going to fall because one development happened to be voted down.
  
And city building is more susceptible to national – and international economic cycles than any kind of political or other whims that have come along over the decades of building in San Francisco. Even Proposition M has not thwarted office development to the degree that people thought it would. Even now with the office boom, there seems to be, for the near future, square footages available for absorption, and
  
so I don't think that individual, one single project, will have any effect on the future development of both apartments, condominiums and offices in San Francisco.


Commissioner Moore:


I want to take a second crack at that as well. I would definitely support the idea that investment -- international investment is attracted to cities, which have strong city governments and strong living design plans, which help create an equal play field in high-rise friendly environment. However, in order to create liveable cities for work and play that high-rise development needs to be interpreted and governed by rules which apply to all. I want to live it with that, and I want to ask staff to please give us an update on how the electorate vote on 8 Washington, indeed, will effect future actions? How does this vote effect decisions that we have made in the past on the project? How will the voters’ vote effect what can be done in the future? We all know that this site will be developed in some form or another; however, I like to see how the vote modifies what has been brought before, based on our approvals.


Commissioner Sugaya:


I want to add quickly, I think that also should include any considerations for how the environmental and CEQA process would work on any subsequent proposed project. 


Commissioner Wu:


I want to talk about two meetings I went to; one was with Director Rahaim, two days ago in SOMA. A number of community based groups from the Mission, SOMA, Eastern and Western SOMA asked for an update to the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan. It’s been – I believe it will be five years, next January from the date that it was effective, and so, I believe Director Rahaim, has asked staff to prepare a memo for the Commission and to have it here at Commission. And on October 30
th
, I spoke at a conference called Just Bay Area, a number of staff were there, Ms. Rogers and a number of staff from Citywide.
  
I thought it was a great opportunity to try tackle some of these really big regional problems with affordable housing, and dealing with the Housing Element, and dealing with the RHNA. And so, it was great to see so many cities there, so many different community based organizations there, and hope that we can keep the conversation going.
  
I believe all of the talks were recorded and they will be on the website of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation.


Commissioner Hillis:


Just a follow-up on the 8 Washington postmortem,
  
I
  
think,
  
no matter what side you were on, I thought it was a well planned project. I think everybody, the
  
proponents, the opponents talked about
  
the affordability issue being the main issue on this, which I think was true. Throughout, 
 
we certainly hear this week in and week out.
  
I think it would be good if we have a discussion here at some point, on that question of what the City is doing about affordable housing in general. Because -- reading the Chronicle, editorialized on the vote, I think today or yesterday and then it kind of got into a decision about the Arena, which I don’t think was really the issue, the issue was affordability and the Arena is not going to really effect affordability in the City.
  
I think things like how do we get redevelopment back? Do we do another affordable housing bond? You know, the Port has a lot of vacant seawall lots, and can affordable housing be built on those other seawall lots. Issues we should talk about, and maybe an update from the City family on how they are tackling that issue and how we can contribute to it.
  


Commissioner Moore:


There was a lot of resonance on Ms. Wu’s comments on affordability and the future of Chinatown, actually, I picked up an article abroad in the International Financial Business Times, which quoted her, and I thought it was very interesting, because we had a discussion here, and I think we all heard her position, which I strongly supported and it made the international news, which I think is very good.

Director’s Announcements


                


Director of Current Planning Jeff Joslin:


First of all, you have a Director's Report in your packet, which identifies our new public outreach engagement website.
  
If you haven’t looked at it, it’s a great portal to all planning related items of particular public interest. So sorry, secondly a more specific announcement, as you know the Department recently published
  
the Transit Effectiveness Project
  
Draft Environmental Impact Report , the public comment period of the draft EIR ended in September. However, the MTA Board will be holding an informational meeting on the service changes on Tuesday, December 3
rd
. The Board meetings are held in this room from 1:00 to 3:00 p.m..
  
And lastly, I want to report briefly on a recent conference that occurred here, a National Green Roofs Conference, called Cities Alive 11
th
 Annual Conference, which brought experts and aficionados from the Green Roof and Green Wall realm to San Francisco. The Conference, coming here, prompted Planning and SPUR to initiate a task force, which resulted in a greener and better road map for San Francisco. Participating in that task force were a number of other Departments, PUC, DBI, SF Environment, as well as representatives from the trades, and real estate, and armed with that, and the results of the Conference, the Department is now forwarding, with those associated agencies, a plan for moving forward to define some potential policy and regulations around future green roofs for the City. If there are no questions that concludes my report.

Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission


 


LAND USE COMMITTEE:
  
None


FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: 


·
         
Supervisor Avalos’s Outer Mission NCD was approved on first read.
  
This Commission heard the item in April of this year and recommended approval with modifications. The new NCD would replace existing minimum parking requirements with maximum parking controls, prohibit fringe financial services, offer a 5’ height bonus for active uses and institute a buffer between medical cannabis dispensaries. If you recall, the most controversial aspect of this ordinance was prohibiting new MCDs from locating within 500 feet of an existing MCD.
  
The Commission’s substantive recommendation was to require Conditional Use for MCDs within 500 of another MCD, rather than banning them outright.
  
The Supervisor integrated all of the Commission’s recommendations into the revised Ordinance.
  


·
         
Also at the Board was Supervisor Avalos’s Ordinance that would direct the Planning Commission to submit a report to the Board of Supervisors evaluating the Planning Code controls for medical cannabis dispensaries. 
 
This ordinance would require the report to be delivered to the Board by Jan 1, 2014.
  
Although this ordinance is not yet law, we’ve known about Supervisor Avalos’ request since early this summer. As such, Planning staff
  
have already started the report and have tentatively reserved space on the Commission’s
  
12/5 agenda. At the Board hearing this week Supervisor Campos expressed concern that this important issue needs more time for outreach—and he amended the ordinance to change the report deadline to May 1
st
, while also emphasizing that the Commission could submit a report earlier if appropriate
  
This item was approved with the amended date.
  
Since the hearing, planning staff have reached out to Supervisor Campos with our outreach strategy and requested his input for additional outreach—while at the same time cautioning that this work is additional, unfunded work and his assistance on outreach would be greatly appreciated.
 


·
         
Appeal of CU for a Wireless Antenna at 725 Taraval.
  
The Planning Commission approved this CU, unanimously, on 10/29/13.
  
It was for a 9 panel WTS facility
 
antennas, screened by minor additions to two existing penthouse structures.
  
The appellants submitted an appeal without providing any justification other than “building code, fire code, planning code, improper and false report of the Planning Dept”.
  
At the hearing, the appellant articulated his understanding of the Planning Code and staff clarified the misinterpretation as well as the reasons why this Commission found the project to be necessary or desirable and compatible with the community.
  
Only two speakers opposed the project. Supervisor Yee is the district supervisor for the project area and led the question by seeking clarity on the Code, the wireless guidelines and the alternative site analysis submitted (voluntarily) by the project sponsor. 
 
After hearing presentations from all parties, the Supervisor moved to approve the CU and the vote was in unanimous support.

HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:


Good afternoon Commissioners, Tim Frye Department staff, here to share with you yesterday – the events from yesterday’s Historic Preservation Commission hearing. The Commission had a very short hearing with only one item on its regular calendar, in which they forwarded a final recommendation to landmark Marcus’ Books pursuant to Article 10 of the Planning Code. That recommendation will be forwarded to the Board of Supervisors for it’s consideration at a future hearing. We have a couple of other announcements the Twin Peaks Tavern local landmark designation was one of four projects celebrating LGBT heritage, that was honored at the Annual LGTB Benefit at the National
  
Trust Conference in Indianapolis, Indiana last week. Myself, along with Moses Corrette and HPC Commissioner Andrew Wolfram were present and represented the project at the event. Other projects recognized in this ceremony included St. Vincent’s Hospital AIDS Memorial Project in New York City.
  
A survey effort happening in Indianapolis, Indiana regarding LGBT history.
  
And our own development of the SF LGBT Historic Context Statement, which is been funded through the Historic Preservation Fund Committee.
    
Also you may be aware there was a fire that broke out on the Juliuss Castle, on October 28, it was a small fire and according to the owner, sparks landed on the wood parapet during the insulation of a hot applied roof membrane, after work was completed, for the day, is when the fire was broke out. There was no fire watch person on site to monitor the work. Following the torching, which is why the fire was able to spread so quickly, the fire caused complete damage and destruction of the entire length of the historic crenellated wood parapet and the building interior also sustained some water damage. The project sponsor was at yesterday’s HPC hearing made some comments to the Commission and he's been working closely with staff to make sure that those elements can be reconstructed. As part of the CofA he just received, to return a restaurant use back to the property. We'll keep you posted those efforts as they move along.
  
And finally, I want to let you know, I’ll be at next week regularly schedule Graffiti Advisory Board Hearing, in light of the recent tagging of a couple building in downtown, and in particular Hibernia Bank. The Advisory Board, has asked how Planning can work more closely with them, just on education, law enforcement and abatement, especially when it pertains to graffiti on local landmark buildings.
  
I will also report back to you the outcome of that hearing, next week. That concludes my comments unless you have any questions.
