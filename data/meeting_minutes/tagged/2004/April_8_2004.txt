7.  Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner Feldstein:


Re: Welcomed a full Commission.


Re:  40
th
 Avenue


- The Commission has received letters regarding this case asking for clarification of the decision the Commission made.  She does not know what the procedure is.


Acting Director Responded:


- When the Commission takes an action and imposes conditions, this becomes like the Planning Code.  It is the Zoning Administrator's responsibility to determine and interpret the Planning Code or the conditions imposed by the Commission.  If staff has a question from the maker of the motion, they will ask either informally or formally for clarification.


Re:  Housing Element


- She feels that the Housing Element should be heard as a separate item from the environmental review document.


- She feels this is the better way to proceed.


Re:  Search for Planning Director


- She has found out that the Mayor's Office has begun a search for a Planning Director.


- The Charter is clear that a Mayor shall appoint someone from a list of three candidates that is provided by the Commission.  That has not happened.


- She is concerned that the Mayor's office will move forward without the required input from the Commission.


- She asked that the Mayor's office start a process with the Commission and that this topic be scheduled as soon as possible to discuss what the Commission would like to do.


Commissioner Antonini:


Re:  Search for Planning Director


- He agrees with Commissioner Feldstein and would like to participate in choosing those three names.


Re:  Housing Element


- It is imperative that differences regarding this item be resolved.


- The nature of the Housing Element itself will have an impact on the environmental [concerns]. 


Commissioner William Lee:


Re:  Presentation from the Entertainment Commission


- Many of the permits issued by the Entertainment Commission will have an impact on Planning Commission cases.


- He requested a presentation from Bob Davis who is the Executive Director of the Entertainment Commission.


Commission Secretary:


Re:  Various Presentations


1) Neighborhoods Parks Council scheduled for April 15, 2004.

 Streets;  Lot 007 in Assessor Block 3799.  The project is related to Planning Case No. 1998.455C, a mixed use development of 148 dwelling units, approximately 35,000 square feet of ground floor commercial space and 256 parking spaces in two basement levels.  Due to the presence of a Caltrain easement, the originally proposed 7'-6" wide sidewalk along Townsend Street would be reduced to 4'-6" to maintain a minimum distance from an existing rail line in the Townsend Street right-of-way.  The reduced sidewalk width is less than the Department of Public Works' minimum 6-foot sidewalk width standard.
