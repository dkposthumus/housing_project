B. COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
9.  Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner William Lee:


Re:  Customer Satisfaction Survey


- In the packet today from the Board of Permit Appeals, they are including a customer satisfaction survey regarding their own Board.


- Taking a look at it, he would like to have something similar for the packets for the Planning Commission to get some sort of indication of how the public perceives them in the areas of public hearing procedures, notification of parties for hearings, staff response and timeliness of responses.


Re:  Joint Hearing


- He requested a joint hearing with SPUR and AIA in order to have a public dialogue regarding the City Planning Department.


Re:  Report from Committee on Jobs


- He submitted a report to staff called San Francisco City and County Budget - Myths, Realities and Suggestions for the Future.


Commissioner Feldstein:


Re:  Appreciation of Planning Staff


- She asked the public to recognize that staff is working very hard under very difficult conditions.


- If the Commission is not getting calls back on the same day, she can imagine that the public is not getting them either so she asked for patience.


Re:  Budget


- The budget and work plan that the Commission just approved really does not include staffing increases.


- It is imperative that the Commission be mindful of the requests they make, but also to encourage Senior management to think about ways that the Commission can utilize staff more effectively.


Commissioner Boyd:


Re:  Inclusionary Housing


- He asked staff to provide a glossary of projects that have been done that have a relationship with inclusionary housing.  This should also include the number of units, if the developers have indicated whether the inclusionary requirement will be offsite or onsite.


- This will be beneficial to the Commission as they zero in to the Housing Element of the General Plan.


Re:  Recalling the Plans and Controls for the Mission and the NEMIZ


- He thanked President Bradford Bell for requesting that the Commission consider recalling their vote on this issue.


Commissioner Sue Lee:


Re:  Appreciation of Staff


- She believes that staff is working very hard and wants them to know that the Commission really appreciates it.


Re:  Article in the San Francisco Chronicle regarding a Planning Department Staff Member


- This article concerns her.  She questions whether the City has a policy about outside employment of city employees.  Did this department give permission for this employee to have this part time job, assuming that he is employed?  


- All this affects the integrity of the Department.  People cannot be doing what they want.


- She is concerned with the moral of the department.


Commissioner William Lee:


Re:  Staffing


- Under the City Charter and Civil Service rules an employee cannot have two jobs.  If the employee has some classification to moonlight, there is a need for the Director and the Civil Service Commission's approval to avoid conflicts of interest.


- Mayor Newsome is looking into something called "City Stat."  He is looking at the work load analysis and numbers for Baltimore, Boston, Indianapolis and Chicago.


- The questions is:  "How busy are our workers?", he believes that absenteeism is an issue.


- He is interested in knowing how many projects the department is doing compared to a base year.


- It is important to know the statistics regarding what staff is doing now before more money is requested for staff.  Staff should also contribute to this information.


Commissioner Antonini:


Re: Relating Income Levels to Housing Prices in Terms of Housing for Purchase


- This has been the subject of discussion and may come up again.


- He thinks that it is easier when one has the rental thing because one can do the math at the 30 percent of disposable income that is being used towards housing prices.  It is more difficult when one is trying to relate what an individual is making, or a family, relative to the cost of the housing and how that relates to the inclusionary housing and the Leno legislation.  What must one be making to be able to afford a $200,000 condominium?  How many family members will have to be working, etc?


- This can be spelled out in a brief page or so.  This would be very helpful to the Commission and to the public.


C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
10. Director's Announcements


Re:  Discretionary Reviews


- They have been working with a few items on DRs.  One is making this process more efficient and how these cases are brought before the Commission.  Staff had been proposing to do some Administrative DRs.  However the Planning Commission has requested that DRs be separated between simple DRs and complex DRs.


- It would be very useful, if some of the Commissioners are interested, for he and staff to work closely with some Planning Commission members-forming some sort of committee--to have meetings and discuss some criteria.


Re: Effectiveness


- He is glad that the Commission recognizes that staff is overwhelmed.  He is having a series of meetings with the different individual divisions to talk about work load issues and how he can respond to them.


- One thing that can be helpful from the Commission is to  analyze the Commission packets that come to them.  It is important to know if the Commission needs everything that is provide to them, what parts are not useful, etc.


- How can staff be more effective with their time.


- Ms. May Fung is leading this in the Neighborhood division.  She has interviewed everyone in the neighborhood division and has a stack of things to review.


- Many of the quadrants are not being effective because of a lack of staff.


Re:  Article in the Chronicle stated by Commissioner Lee


- To the extent that he can, this is a personnel issue and there are some confidentiality issues.


- He can say that he was extremely upset to read it, he has received a number of phone calls about this, he is taking this very seriously and is pursuing it.


- In terms of city policy, one can do some outside employment, but there should be an approval from the Director and either the Civil Service Commission or Department of Human Resources.  Every six months that approval should be updated.


- There has been outside employment approved previously for teaching.


- This is as much as he can say now but he is looking at this very seriously.


Re:  Director Green


- He will be in town next week and will be in attendance at the Planning Commission.

11. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals


BOS - None


BOA - 


Re:  572 San Jose Avenue


- This was an appeal of a denial that the Commission heard.  The Commission took Discretionary Review and denied approval of the permit.


- The Board made a motion to overturn the Commission's decision but this failed to pass on a +3-2 vote.


- The parties were heard over a month ago to try to reach an agreement but were not able to do so.


Re:  293 Downey Street


- This case was heard by the Commission under two separate Discretionary Reviews.


- The Commission did not take Discretionary Review and approve a very large, elegantly designed rear addition to the structure.


- The Board upheld the Commission's decision and allowed the project to proceed.

 -  
Certification of a Final Environmental Impact Report
:  The State Compensation Insurance Fund (SCIF) proposes to expand their San Francisco office at 1275 Market Street by constructing an adjacent 12-story, approximately 268,000 gross-square-foot (gsf) office building at 55 Ninth Street.  The project site (Assessor's Block 3701, Lot 63) is occupied by a surface parking lot with about 173 parking spaces and located mid-block on the northeastern side of Ninth Street in the block bounded by Market, Ninth, Mission, and Eighth Streets in the Mid-Market neighborhood.  The new building would be approximately 198 feet high, including mechanical penthouse, and would have a two-level below-grade parking garage with about 126 parking spaces.  The entrance to the new building and access to off-street parking and loading would be from Ninth Street.  Trucks would enter and exit on Ninth Street and could exit to Laskie Street onto Mission Street.  The project site is zoned C-3-G (Downtown General Commercial) and is within a 120-X Height and Bulk District.  


Preliminary Recommendation:  Certify the Final Environmental Impact Report.  Please note that the public review period for the Draft Environmental Impact Report ended at 5:00 pm, January 27, 2004.

DISCRETIONARY REVIEW COST RECOVERY PROGRAM
 - On September 25, 2003, the Planning Commission directed the Department to implement cost recovery for all Discretionary Review (DR) requests, as provided in Sections 352(b) and 350(c) of the Planning Code.  Discretionary Review applicants will be responsible for any time and materials costs incurred in excess of the initial fee paid for any DR projects filed. The Planning Commission will establish the start date for the Planning Department's DR Cost Recovery Program; and review details of program implementation.


Preliminary Recommendation:  Establish start date sometime after April 8, 2004 to allow one month for program start up.


 


SPEAKER(S):


Re:  Continuance


Mary Ann Miller - West Portal 


- There is a need to have more discussions on this issue and negotiate something a little bit better.


Dan Liberthson - Miraloma Improvement Club


- If this item is continued he would like to give his testimony today.


Re:  Merits of the Project


Mary Ann Miller


- This policy is a very good club to hold over the architect and the developer.


- There are many other ways to deal with DRs, perhaps the Commission could be more involved in DRs.


- The public has been the unpaid staff of the department.  There are many people who work very hard to deal with all the issues and now they are going to be charged $2,500 dollars?


- Cost recovery cannot be done on DRs.


- It is important to concentrate on the public relations.


John Bardis


- Cost recovery is something that occurs when something has happened to cause the City to have expenses to be paid so the person who has caused these actions, this person should pay.


- The initiator of the Discretionary Review has not initiated the cost.


- It is important to find out who is the initiator of the costs.


- The Commission should actually applaud people who bring projects to DR hearings because they are doing the legwork of maintaining the City.


- This is insane.  The Commission should not increase the fees.  Fees should be abolished.


Penelope Clark


- This is the second time that she has come down to a hearing and the item has been continued.


- It is difficult to come down and then have to leave without having heard the item.


Judy Berkowitz


- She would like to have this item heard on a date after April 8, 2004.


Marilyn Amini


- The notice for this item has not been sufficient.


- There was lack of availability of this proposal in a timely manner so that people could have enough time to submit comments to the Commission.


- The agenda notice today asks of the direction from the Commission to the department but on the September 25
th
 calendar, there is no indication of a recovery of fees.


- For a whole year there were 228 DRs filed and the Commission only heard 92.


- There are many other ways to cut down on DRs.


Vivian Lee


- The fees should be charged to the project applicants since they cause all the problems.


ACTION: Hearing held, item continued to April 22, 2004 (and to be placed first on the calendar).  Public comment remains open.

- He will be initiating an ordinance that will contain language providing specifically that all features of the New Mission Theatre called out in the Landmark Designation Report, recommended by the Landmarks Advisory Board, be preserved and must be subject to provisions of Article 10 including those provisions regarding certificate of appropriateness regardless of the building's ownership status.


- The buyer has stated on at least one occasion that it is his intention to preserve the New Mission and to ensure public access to the space.


- But since there are no plans submitted yet to the Planning Department, he just wants to be sure that the interior and exterior features are preserved.


Ned Segal - San Francisco Neighborhood Theatre Foundation


- This foundation has about 600 members.


- He urged the Commission to declare this building a landmark.


- There is no proof that the new owner will preserve the historical details of the building.

- He will be working with staff and the preservation board to walk through the changes.


Rachel Herber - Dolores Park Café


- She urged the Commission to make this property a landmark.


- This is a very important structure and it should be preserved.


- If it is done properly and preserved properly it would enhance the Mission corridor.


- The potential for this is tremendous.


Alan Martinez - Friends of 1800.


- This would be a magnificent auditorium.


- This is too much of an important community resource to loose.


Catherine Petrin - Architectural Historian


- She has been an active pro-bono architect to preserve the New Mission Theatre.


- There has been erroneous information stating that the theatre had had so many changes that it was difficult to determine its architectural and historical integrity.


- This theatre is on par with the Castro Theatre.


- The theatre contains original seats and carpeting.


Will Shank


- He is one of the founders of the Safe New Mission Theatre.


- He has been working on this for about four years.


- This matter has been brought before many groups.

- He hopes that this Commission would take into consideration the beauty of this building.

The project will also include a lot line adjustment between Lots 51 and 56.  The property is located in NC-1 (Neighborhood Commercial Cluster) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.  


Preliminary Recommendation:  Approval with Conditions


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Patrick Mahone


- The proposed use is quite desirable and compatible with the neighborhood.


- There is a huge shortage for residential care facilities.


- Currently the downstairs of the building is vacant.


- It is his hope that with capital improvements and complete occupancy of the space, this would provide a great service to the neighborhood.


- This project will not add any additional square footage to the building.


- They have been quite supportive of the requirements from the Department.


- He urges the swift approval of the proposal.


(+) Lisa Wong - Project Architect


- In the past she knows that the Commission liked having the architect of a project present during the hearing.


- This is a very commendable project.


- This project is commendable because it is a very noble thing that is being done.


- She is also available for questions.


(+) Rev. Harold Pierre


- He is the pastor of a community church located across the street.


- He is in support of the proposal because it is not generally a rough neighborhood.  The grocery store/liquor store has caused the rough environment.  He is glad that this store is gone.


- This is going to be a diverse housing community.


(-) Dan Weaver - OMI Neighbors in Action


- He supports the idea of senior housing.


- He does not support this particular project:  1) this project is not necessary or desirable because it will eliminate one full block of retail uses; 2) the 300 block of Randolf Street is the 100% block for the revitalization of this neighborhood; 3) this project will cause a housing building to be built there.  This is not appropriate.


- The appropriate thing to do is to design a structure with retail uses on the ground floor.


- He asked the project sponsor to postpone this item but they refused.


(+) Rebecca Silverberg


- This project is excellent.  It is bringing a lot of people to it.


- This is a lovely neighborhood where seniors are going to need services.

(+/-) Peter Vaernet


- He realizes that this area is a very tough neighborhood.

833 - 881 JAMESTOWN AVENUE
 - 
Appeal of Preliminary Negative Declaration. 
 The project sponsor proposes construction of a Planned Unit Development (PUD) that would consist of 198 one-, two- and three-bedroom market-rate condominiums on an approximately 6.9-acre lot, located at 833-881 Jamestown Avenue on Assessor's Block 4991, Lot 277, on the northern slope of  Bayview Hill.  The site is currently used as an overflow parking lot for events at Candlestick Park, which is approximately one-third of a mile southeast of the project site.  The site is bordered by Jamestown Avenue (and single-family homes on the north side of Jamestown) to the north, another vacant lot to the east that also is used for parking for major events at Candlestick Park, the hillside to the south, and single-family housing to the west.  Although the area proposed for development is mostly flat, development would require excavation of up to approximately 30 vertical feet at the base of the hill.  The project would consist of 11 separate three- and four-story buildings:  seven buildings of 12 to 18 units each along Jamestown Avenue and four buildings to the rear, at the base of the hillside.  Of these latter four structures, two (36 units each) would be built atop one-story gated parking garages, while smaller buildings (one of eight and one of 10 units) would flank the garages.  A total of 216 independently accessible parking spaces would be provided.  The proposed project would include landscaping along Jamestown Avenue, construction of a 10-foot-wide sidewalk, two off-street freight loading areas, and about 28,900 sq. ft. of common open space, including two rear yards at the base of the hillside totaling about 7,250 sq. ft. and podium- and ground-level patios.  The project also would remedy an existing drainage problem on Bayview Hill above the project site, on Recreation and Park Department land.  The project site is located within the South Bayshore Plan area, in an RH-2 (Two-Family) Use District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.  As a PUD, the project would require review and approval by the City Planning Commission pursuant to Sections 303 and 304 of the Planning Code.
