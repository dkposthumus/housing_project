1. 2002.0914R (D. ARGUMEDO: (415) 558-6284)


675 TOWNSEND STREET
 - The project is related to Planning Case 
        No. 1998.455C, a mixed use development of 148 dwelling units, approximately 
        35,000 square feet of ground floor commercial space and 256 parking spaces 
        in two basement levels. Due to the presence of a Caltrain easement in 
        the Townsend Street right-of-way, the originally proposed 7'-6" wide 
        sidewalk along Townsend Street would be reduced to 4'-6" to maintain 
        a minimum distance from an existing rail line in the Townsend Street right-of-way. 
        The reduced sidewalk width is less than the Department of Public Works' 
        minimum 6-foot sidewalk width standard. 


Preliminary Recommendation: Finding the proposal not in conformity with 
        the General Plan.

6.  Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner Feldstein:


Re:  Addendum


- She was unclear if the Regular Calendar started at 3:00 p.m. or 1:30 p.m.


Commission Secretary Responded:


- In a I:00 p.m. meeting on Monday afternoon, it was brought to her attention that two components of item 9-a matter that the Commission would need to consider and take action on-were not included on the original calendar.  She could not issue the addendum by 1:30 p.m. to meet the 72 hour notice deadline.  Because she could get the addendum out by 3:00 p.m., she put that as the start time.  It only means that item 9 can not be heard before 3:00 p.m.


Re: Public Employee Evaluation Session


- Even though this item was cancelled, she would like to have it scheduled on the calendar in the future.


Commissioner Bradford Bell Responded:


- Not all Commissioners need to be present at this level.


- She sent out an email about this.


- Rather than set a full meeting to require at least four Commissioners, right now it is only to gather information and put together the process of how the review will be done for the staff person.  Then it will come back to the Commission.  She suggested that Commissioner Feldstein might want to work with the staff person at this stage


- Anyone who wants to participate in the process, should.


- She welcomes comments and suggestions from the Commission on going about it any other way as well.


- She asked if Commissioners want to schedule a full Commission meeting.  If so, she would have Linda put a meeting together.


Commissioner Feldstein Responded:


- She is only concerned that it is highly irregular that a supervisor of an employee decline to participate in the performance evaluation of that employee.


Commissioner Bradford Bell Responded:


- The information has not been gathered.  A performance review has not been done in many years so the documentation the Commission needs really needs to be gathered and updated.


Commissioner Hughes Responded:


- On the criteria of the evaluation, he feels that if it already exits... 


- He is fine with having one Commissioner to take over at this point in the evaluation.


Commissioner S. Lee Responded:


- She is fine with not having a full meeting.


- However, she does not want to prolong the process just because a quorum cannot be met.


Commissioner Antonini Responded:


- He feels that one Commissioner can do the information gathering but he would like to be present when the full meeting on the evaluation takes place.


Commission Secretary Responded:


- It was at her request that all seven Commissioners to be part of the process.


- Since it is proving to be very difficult to get all seven Commissioners at one time, she is willing to accept a meeting with less than the seven Commissioners to move this forward.


D. DIRECTOR'S REPORT

7. Director's Announcements


Re: Air Conditioning at 1660 Mission Street


- Real Estate has spent a lot of time trying to fix the problems with the air conditioning.


- He mentions this so that the Commission is aware of the kind of work environment staff has had to endure recently.


- At 30 Van Ness the server has been down.  They have finally discovered that the voltage is not adequate.  It's not really 220.


Commission Secretary commented:


Re:  EIR for Transbay


- The EIR is ready.  It only needs a cover letter, an executive summary, and it needs to be transmitted.  But all of this cannot happen because the server at 30 Van ness is not working.


- The documents will be delivered today for distribution to Commissioners.  The copies to the public will be available at 1660 Mission Street.

KXCMTZLU (A. LIGHT: (415) 558-6254)


690 MARKET STREET
 -  north side at northeast corner of Kearny and Geary Streets, Lot 6, in Assessor's Block 311
 - 
Request for adoption of CEQA findings and a mitigated negative declaration pursuant to 1) a finding that a net new shadow impact on Union Square Park is not adverse; 2) a Determination of Compliance under Section 309 of the Planning Code to permit an eight-story vertical addition, historic façade restoration, and conversion of an existing office building to a mixed-use project for up to 64 residential dwelling units, up to 73 hotel time-share units, approximately 6,500 square feet of ground level retail space, and a sub grade parking garage (capable of accommodating up to 29 independently-accessible parking spaces and two loading spaces with the capability of accommodating up to 100 vehicles through the use of valet services and vehicle stacking), with exceptions to the Planning Code for the separation of towers requirement, residential open space requirements, publicly-accessible open space requirements, dwelling unit exposure requirements, ground-level wind currents,  independently-accessible parking, sunlight access to sidewalks, and an upper tower extension; 3) a Conditional Use application to allow a hotel in the C-3-O (Downtown, Office) Zoning District;  4) a recommendation to the Board of Supervisors for a General Plan amendment to change the height and bulk district of the existing site; 5) a recommendation to the Board of Supervisors for approval of the creation of the Downtown Housing Demonstration Special Use District encompassing and comprised of the subject property and allowing, among other items, exceptions under Section 309 for residential open space requirements, publicly-accessible open space requirements, and dwelling unit exposure; 6) recommendation to the Board of Supervisors for conditional designation as San Francisco Landmark No. 243 
(to be heard at a subsequent Planning Commission hearing date)
; and 7) recommendation to the Board of Supervisors for conditional approval of a Mills Act Contract 
(also to be heard at a subsequent Planning Commission hearing date)
 ; all for the subject property, which is in the C-3-O Zoning District and a 250-S Height and Bulk District.  The proposal is to:


1)  Seismically upgrade the subject 16-story office building (The Old Chronicle Building), which would include infilling a large light well at the rear of the building that is not visible from any public right-of-way;


2)  Restore the historic building façade by removing a non-historic metal, glass and marble cladding system installed in 1962 and rehabilitating/restoring/reconstructing intact, damaged and missing historic façade features;


3)  Construct an eight-story vertical addition that will result in a building height of approximately 312 feet, and a Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of approximately 19.68 if the residential floor space were to be counted toward the FAR calculation as currently required by the Planning Code (see item No. 5 below);


4)  Convert the existing office building use to a mixed-use project that would have at least 40, but up to 64 residential dwelling units, at least 49, but up to 73 hotel time-share units (for a combined total of 113 hotel and residential units), approximately 6,500 square feet of ground level retail space, replacing an existing retail bank, and creating a sub grade parking structure, that given the irregular floor plate shape and placement of support columns would yield a maximum of 29 independently-accessible parking spaces and two loading spaces on the project site with the capability of providing up to 100 valet and vehicle-stacking spaces in place of the independently-accessible spaces.  The new parking facility would be accessed through an existing sub grade garage facility at the adjacent 88 Kearny Street property, thereby not requiring a garage entrance at the ground level of the subject 690 Market Street property;


5)  In order to construct the addition; infill the light well; implement the proposed change of use; grant exceptions for residential open space, publicly-accessible open space, and dwelling unit exposure under the procedures of Section 309, a new Special Use District is proposed to change the existing height district to a 285-S Height and Bulk District (the Planning Code allows for a 10% increase in height over the height limit under certain criteria, in this case up to 313.5 feet), eliminate residential uses from Floor Area Ratio calculations, and allow said exceptions under Section 309 instead of requiring variances.  The Special Use District would also require a minimum of 15% on-site or 17% off-site Below Market Rate (BMR) units.  The Downtown Element of the General Plan must also be amended as it specifies the height and bulk districts as currently designated within the C-3 zoning districts;


6)  The Project Sponsor is proposing to meet the Below Market Rate (BMR) housing requirement by constructing the required BMR units off-site at 938 Market Street, a project that is seeking authorization concurrently with the subject application (2003.0587HXVLU);


7)  The project sponsors are seeking to avail themselves of the Mills Act, which allows local governments to grant property tax relief benefits in exchange for the guaranteed preservation of a historic property.  In order to qualify under the San Francisco Administrative Code, the property must either be designated as a San Francisco Landmark or listed separately on the National Register.  As neither condition is the case with the subject property, the project sponsor is seeking conditional San Francisco landmark status.  The proposed Landmark Designation would become final upon the completion of the proposed project consistent with the Rehabilitation Program set forth by the proposed Mills Act contract.


Preliminary Recommendation:  Adopt CEQA findings and mitigated negative declaration.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of February 19, 2004)


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Charles (Chuck) Bloszies - Lead Architect


- This is a real architectural treasure.  They have considered it the equivalent of raising the Titanic!


- If the original building is compared with the building with it's first addition, it is actually out of balance.


- They have tried to rectify this out-of-balance condition.


- The height of the building was kind of limited to protect shadows on Union Square and to not over shadow it's adjacent historic building.


- There will be 106 residential units and 49 fractional interest units or hotel units.


- There were a number of endorsement letters submitted as part of the packet for this project.


(+) Jay Turnbull - Page and Turnbull


- This project is of great historic significance because it contributed to the rise of newspaper journalism in the City.  It is associates with at least four prominent people:  Michael D. Young, Daniel Burnham, John Route and Willis Polk.


- It was the first skyscraper in the West.


- San Francisco's oldest trade union which was organized in the early 50s.


- It survived the 1906 earthquake, although it has been substantially upgraded since then.


-The key characteristic of this building is height.


(+) Mary G. Murphy - Farella, Braun and Martel


- Regarding 942 Market Street, which is the companion piece to the current project:


- This will be the site of the below market housing.


- 942 Market will have 11 below market rate units.


- This project will be treated and is consistent with the Code's constraints regarding Category 1 buildings.


- This building will be converted from office to residential.


(+/-) Francisco Da Costa - Environmental Justice Advocacy


- What the Commission should pay attention to is the quality of life issues.


- He commends the architects for the wonderful work and is pleased to hear the history of these wonderful buildings.


- There should be at least 25 percent of affordable housing on site and not off site.


- Stop building more units and not pay attention to the infrastructure.  The sewer system cannot pay the added burden.


- This type of project was not presented to the communities in the southeast sector.


(+) Kate White - Housing Action Coalition


- They took a look at this project and are very excited about it.


It brings many public benefits:  historic rehabilitation work, 19 percent or more will be right in the same neighborhood, the project serves as a model for high density office to residential conversions.  With so many office buildings that could be converted, there should be more of these. 


- It would be good to have more residential units in downtown San Francisco so that it is not so dead on the weekends.


- Both the Bicycle Coalition and Transportation for a Livable City endorse this project.


(+) Jim Salinas - Carpenter's Union


- They are very supportive of this project because it has a great deal of historical value.


- There is much needed housing and construction jobs with this project.

Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions


(Continued from Regular Meeting of January 15, 2004)


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Jason Smith - Verizon Wireless


- The project involves four antennas on an existing motel.


- The location is a preference 4 location and is considered a preferred location since there were no locations with a lower number.


- The coverage in the area is extremely poor.


- Current customer use is growing at a significantly large rate.


- The only way to meet the wireless necessities of the area is to install these antennas.


- There would be a screen wall that will be painted the same color as the building where they will be installed.


- Trilingual notices were sent out about this antenna.  There were neighborhood meetings and about 20 people attended.


- An attempt was made to install these antennas at the Lucas Film location in the Presidio but there was no interest.


- The applicable site complies with the Planning Code sections as well as the WTS Guidelines.


(-) Mary Irene Zemenek


- She lives behind the building where the proposed antenna is proposed to be installed.


- She is opposed to this installation.  She did a study.  She made calls from her home and from various locations on the street near the proposed site and had zero dropped calls.


(-) Albert Dong


- He and his family owns 3030 Broderick Street which is located directly above and next to the proposed Verizon site.


- He is also a resident of the building. All of the tenants of this building have signed a petition against this installation.


- Their fears are sincere and he hopes the Commission will take them into consideration.


- The building where the proposed antenna is to be installed is right at the bottom of a steep hill so the antenna is directly across from his apartment.


- He believes that a win-win situation could be achieved if this antenna is installed at the Presidio.


(-) Jan Diamond


- The proposed installation is not a desirable thing for this location.


- There are hundreds of signatures of people who are opposed to the project.


- The Planner only received one call in support of the project.


- She is sure that Verizon will bring some neighbors in to prop up their argument.


- She urged the Commission to find out where the people in support really live.


- She believes that although Verizon is requesting installation for 4 antennas, they really want eight.


- The notices that Verizon sends really looks like junk mail.  Many people probably did not read them.


(-) Tony David


- He opposes this application.


- What do opponents need to show for the Commission to disapprove a proposal like this?


(-) Dale F. Bentson


- He lives on Greenwich Street.


- He is concerned about property values and property taxes.


- If the neighbors allow this installation, there will soon be other cell phone carriers who will want to install their antennas in the neighborhood.


- It has been proven already that the neighborhood does not need this since there are not any dropped calls.


- These antennas are not welcome in his neighborhood.


(-) Don Weil


- He lives on Greenwich Street.


- Mark Longwood and he stood in the area where this antenna is proposed and his phone was programmed to receive the signals and determine the strength level and which antennas he was picking up.  This took place for an hour and a half and they did not get any dropped calls during that time.


- He disputes the information provided by Verizon stating that there is a need to install antennas.


(-) Jame Weil


- She lives behind the motel and the proposed site.


- There is no proof that there is low cell phone quality.


(-) Barbara Simkin


- She lives on Greenwich Street.


- She opposes this installation.


- It has not been mentioned but Lucas Film will be having a site with 2,500 employees in the next year.


- She cannot believe that Verizon does not have planned the need for these 2, 500 employees.  She feels that the antennas should be located at the Lucas Film site.


(-) Richard Rypinkski


- He is a renter so he has no concern for property value.


- It does not take a horticulturist to determine that the trees near the project site are dying.


- He has no small children but understands the concerns of the other neighbors.


- He is concerned with the planning issues because he is a former planning commissioner.


(-) Kathleen David Zemanek


- She is concerned that by approving these antennas, there is no positive balance for the residents of Cow Hollow.


- She did not do such a formal study as the others, but she has several friends that use Verizon and they have excellent service with no dropped calls.


(-) Julia Noy


- She went to the Verizon store and they told her that people have been getting excellent service because of the antenna at Ghirardelli Square.


- She urged the Commission to deny this proposal.


(-) Steven Callow


- There is a flow of inconsistencies with information that has been provided to both the public and the Commission.


(-) Irene Zemanek


- She is the proud grandmother of two children whose bedroom will be directly across from the site where these antennas will be installed.  This is the reason she is opposed to this installation.


- She read a letter from a neighbor who is opposed to this proposal.


- She urged the Commission to reject this proposal.


(-) Albert Hom


- He has been appalled at the lack of information provide to the public as well as the inconsistencies.


- This application is therefore flawed.


- He believes that Verizon has been careless and lazy in the preparation of this application.


(-) Elizabeth Traub


- She is a homeowner near the proposed site.


- She has three children.


- She will continue to fight so that these antennas will not be installed.


(-) Jack Grandcolas


- He read a letter from the Cow Hollow Association who is opposed to this installation.


(-) Lori Brooke


- She asked everyone in the hearing room who is against this application to stand.


- She is a cell phone user and is not against progress, but there should be intelligent progress.


- The Presidio is the only location where everyone has been in agreement for the location of these antennas.


(-) Patricia Voughey


- There is no necessity for these antennas.


- These antennas are for proposed use and not for existing use.


- These major corporations are offering them a third of the going rate to go in at a lower deal.  This should not happen anywhere in this City.


- This application should be denied because of the principal of it all.

321-323 GRANT AVENUE
 - west side between Bush and Sutter Streets, Lot 003 in Assessor's Block 0286 - Request for conditional use authorization to establish a tourist hotel use within a C-3-R (Downtown Retail) District and an 80-130-F Height and Bulk District.  The existing building, the Baldwin Hotel, contains 61 residential hotel rooms, of which 47 are vacant.  The proposed project is to convert all 61 residential hotel rooms to tourist hotel rooms.  There will be no physical expansion of the existing building.


Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Joel Yodowitz - Project Sponsor


- This proposal is to convert the residential units to hotel use.


- No tenants will be displaced by the proposal.


- Each of the existing tenants support the project.


- Three people are here in support but will not speak to save time.


- This project will provide a moderately priced alternative to visitors to the City.


- He requests a change under the Conditions of Approval.  Under Paragraph 2, which states that the three year duration of the Conditional Use..., should be modified to read that the three year period would run from the date of issuance of a permit to convert under residential hotel unit conversion and demolition ordinance rather than three years commencing to run from the approval date in the motion because this administrative process will take a year.


ACTION: Approved with Amendments to the Findings as follows:  the authorization granted shall be valid for three years after the date of the adoption of this motion and shall become null and void after that time if the required permit to convert has not been obtained.


Page 2 - Finding No. 3, the very last paragraph should add the following language:  there is no evidence that the project sponsor made broader efforts to lease the vacant rooms.


Page 3 - Finding No. 5, the third paragraph should reference the documentation of the offers of the lifetime leases.


Page 6 - Finding No. 12, the second paragraph, the second sentence should add the following:  ...continuance efforts (the limited in the scope of outreach)....  A note should be listed that the vacancy rates are inaccurate and misleading.


Strike the third and fourth paragraph of Finding 12 since staff does not have the capacity to review the economic viability of the projects.


Finding No. 15, a, paragraph 2, the third sentence:  ...continuance efforts (the limited in the scope of outreach)...


AYES: Antonini, Bradford Bell, Boyd, Feldstein, Hughes, S. Lee, W. Lee
