7.  Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner Feldstein:


Re:  Mayor Newsom's Transition Team


- She has been following with great interest the work from Mayor Newsom's Transition Team.


- Read carefully the Task Force Report on the Planning Department.


- She thanked the public who has done a tremendous amount of work on this document.


- She finds that some of what is reflected in this report is not consistent with her experience with the work from the Department and staff.


- She hopes that as the Commission moves forward with the new administration, staff from the Planning Department will work diligently with the new Mayor to make sure that it is clear what the mission of the Department and staff is.


- She would appreciate receiving feedback from the Mayor's office on this issue.


Commissioner William Lee:


Re: Proposition E - Ethics Reform


- Last December, voters decided on Proposition E regarding ethics reform.


- Each department received a memo from Ginny Vida, Executive Director of the Ethics Commission requesting that each department provide a statement of incompatible activities.


- He is requesting that the Department consider this as a priority so that the public can submit comments to the Commission and staff.

9. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals


BOS
 - 


Land Use Committee


Re:  Eastern Neighborhoods


- He, as well Dr. Amit Ghosh and staff attended the Land Use Committee meeting to report on the status of the Eastern Neighborhood proposals.


- Supervisor McGoldrick requested a similar presentation from staff as the one presented at the December 18, 2003 Planning Commission hearing.


Re:  Rincon Hill Plan


- This item was continued to a future date.


Full Board of Supervisors Meeting:


Re:  Appeal of the Environmental document for 899 North Point 


- This item was continued to a future date so that the project sponsor and the neighborhood can continue working together to come to a solution.


Finance Committee


- The release of the $137,000 for the Eastern Neighborhood environmental review hearing was continued to January 28, 2004.


BOA
 - 


Craig Nikitas, Acting Zoning Administrator reported:


Re:  8 Washington Street


- This project consists of constructing approximately 120 units, a recreation center and a health club.


- The appeal before the board was on a Zoning Administrator (ZA) determination concerning the process for hearing weather the entire redevelopment area, for which the controls have lapsed, was required to be brought back to modify a planned unit development or whether the project could be brought back on it's own.


- There was a motion from the Board to overturn the ZA's determination that the project could be heard as a stand alone project but that vote failed with a +2-3 vote.  The ZA's determination stands.


Re:  2368 Vallejo Street


- The Planning Commission heard this case in February of 2003.


- The project consisted of a multi story rear addition to a two family dwelling.


- The Commission modified the proposal by reducing the height of an 8 foot firewall on an upper story deck, and requiring insulation of a lower firewall and a trellis with planting.


- The Board of Appeals further modified the project by requiring that the firewall be lowered and moved three feet from the property line with an open railing to further protect two property line windows on the appellant's property.


- This modification passed by a +5-0 vote.


D. PUBLIC COMMENT ON AGENDA ITEMS WHERE THE PUBLIC HEARING HAS BEEN CLOSED


At this time, members of the public who wish to address the Commission on agenda items that have already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the public hearing has been closed, must do so at this time.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.


Re:  4071 18
th
 Street


(+) Lee Moulton - Architect for Project Sponsor


- He lives and works in San Francisco.


- All rooms have been identified.


- The street elevation now shows both buildings.


- The commercial space on the first floor is not changing.


- The 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 floors have changed--going from 4 units to 2 units.


- Regarding density: the project has gone from a total of 8 bedrooms to a total of 6 bedrooms.  This, therefore, reduces the density.


- The amount of circulation has been reduced by going to two flats rather than having two individual staircases within the units.  This will provide more floor space to the flats.


- The height has come down slightly as well.


- Each unit has separate exits.


- A rail has been set back 3 feet to address the concern of throwing things over to the neighbor's yard.


(+) Jennifer Cofield - Architect for Project Sponsor


- She reviewed some of the items of concern from the Commission: 1) the original demolition plan not having enough information; 2) the units being too compact and circulation problems within the units themselves; 3) not having adequate exits; and 4) concern from a neighbor about the possibility that things might be thrown into their yard.


Re: 1350-1352 Thomas Avenue


Al Norman - Bay View Merchants


- Congratulated President Bell on her election.


- There were some concerns from the community about the length of the houses.


- In Bay View there were some concerns about the 25x100 foot lots.  


- The proposed housing, which has already come before the PAC, should go forward.


Michael Murray


- He presented a letter from the Bay View PAC in support of the project.


Paraic O'Donoghue


- They went to speak to the Bay View PAC and are here now to present their [Bay View PAC] approval of the project.


Joe "O'Donoghue - Residential Builders


- Mike Murray builds a lot in the Mission District.


- This is a housing project that will make people comfortable in the area.


- The Bay View PAC approves the project, so he asks the support of the Commission.


Mack Burton


- He would like the Commission to approve this project.


- He has gone door-to-door and has received support for this project.

- Size does matter.  Haight Street does have controls, etc.


- Haight Street has controls that state neighborhood serving retail uses are for the residential population. That is why there is no off street parking.


- This area is not a regional shopping center.


- The attempt to bring a large volume chain store causes problems and violates the code.

- What are people afraid of?

- He is President of the Haight Ashbury Merchants Association.

- Many of the people that come to his shop are in support of the project.

(-) Laura Adams


- She came to San Francisco because of the diversity.


- She comes from Arizona and there is an Urban Outfitters there that changed the area and she does not want this to happen to the Haight Street area.

- Everyone visits Haight Street.


- The whole City goes shopping on Haight Street at least once a year.


(+) Roger Ryan - E Moving Company

- Laundromats are becoming a thing of the past because many of new multi unit buildings have washing machines.


(-) Larry Roberts


- He has lived in the Haight for ten years.


- A lot of businesses have closed down in the Haight.


- The main point here is that the current zoning does not allow the square footage.


- If Urban Outfitters wants to open a store, it should open in another area.


(+) Mack Burton


- Twenty years ago he had a furniture store in the Fillmore District.


- During that time, the Haight was a booming area.  That area has dwindled down ever since.

(-) Pinky Kushner - 6

- This project does not fill any neighborhood character requirements.


(-) Ted Loewenberg


- There are many businesses on Haight Street that are not "mom and pop" stores.


- There is garbage on every corner of Haight Street.  This is not neighborhood character.


- The store does not sell drugs, pierce body parts, etc.  Is this what people are opposed to?


(-) Jim Rhoads


- He does not think that the businesses on Haight Street are opposed to another business.


- Residents and business owners are just opposed to the size of the project and the fact that the Planning Code is not being respected.


- He hopes that the Commission will not approve this project.  But if it does, it should scale it down.


(-) Martha Hoffman


- She owns property in the Haight Street area.


- She is opposed to this store coming into the area as well as the size of the project.


- She finds the building to be very unattractive and having this type of store in that location would just make it worse.


(-) Barbara Sange


- She is an artist and lives in the Haight Street area.


- The area has gone through its "highs" and "lows."


- The size of this store is what is creating all the opposition.


(+) Tom McDonough


- Urban Outfitters has a social conscience.  It stimulates creativity and looks to the neighborhood to energize itself.


- Haight must look for ways to become more economically vibrant.


- The storefront is only 50 feet, and that is not overwhelming to him.


(+) Deric Casey


- He hopes that the Commission will approve this project.


- Mr. Brennan has worked hard to welcome this store.


- Competition is a good thing.  Everyone should go where they want.


(+) Joe O'Donaghue


- Many people are saying that big is bad and success is bad.


- The issue that people have is that people are saying that the location is too large for the store yet Goodwill has a larger location.


- There are ridiculous concepts here based on the character of the neighborhood.


- The City and consumers need choices.


- This project should be approved.

This proposal requires Conditional Use authorization because it proposes: 1) the expansion of a secondary school in an RM-1 District, 2) it proposes to modify a prior Conditional Use authorization granted in 1993 (Case No. 1993.0094C), and 3) it proposes to develop a project site of over ½ acre (also called a Planned Unit Development, or PUD), which would allow modifications to the standard Code requirements such as rear yard and open space. With the proposed project, the Urban School plans to increase enrollment from 250 to 380 students, as well as increasing full and part-time employees from 50 to 70.  The new structure would contain classrooms, offices, a student center, a chemistry lab, and various support spaces.  The proposed project would also add one off-street parking space to the existing basement parking at 1563 Page Street.


Preliminary Recommendation:  Approval with Conditions


(Continued from Regular Meeting of December 4, 2003)


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Mark Sulkind - Director of Urban School


- Urban School is an independent progressive high school that offers a rigorous college preparatory education to 250 students.  The school has been in operation since 1966.


- Urban School has been located in the Haight for 27 years.


- The addition will provide badly needed classrooms, modern science laboratories, a dedicated music facility, a student cafeteria and a fully accessible main entrance to the school.


- The design responds sensitively to the scale of the buildings on Page Street.


- Urban is fighting to pay competitive salaries to teachers.


- By increasing the student body, it will strengthen the school's financial foundation.  


- A maximum student body of 380 is the right size for Urban School.


(+) Barbara Kimport


- With the approval of this project, Urban School will obtain financial viability and be able to provide excellent service to the school's community, the broader neighborhood and San Francisco.


- The Board of Trustees has determined that having less than 400 students would be more than viable for the school.


- She thanks the Commission for their support.


(+) Angela Brown - Director of Admissions


- Recently they have witnessed an unprecedented interest from Bay Area families in Urban School.  They received over 1,300 requests for admissions information.


- For the past five years, Urban School has received over 400 applications to the Freshman class.  Each year, the admissions committee must deny admission to many qualified students.


- With only 60-65 Freshman available spaces in the class, it is very painful to deny admission to the school.


- They are eager to open the doors to more qualified students.


(+) Matt Bens


- He lives in the Haight Ashbury area.


- He is very enthusiastic about this project.


- He is a parent of a five-year-old daughter.


- The building will also add to the life of the street.


(+) Langston Smith


- He is a sophomore at Urban School.


- He has been able to learn about social issues and be able to participate in many of the important issues that happen in San Francisco.

- She encourages the Commission to allow an opportunity for more students.


(+) Algis Sodonis


- He is head of the science department.


- Science students really need to have more space for experiments, storage, etc.  Approving this project will allow this.


(-) Tes Welbern - HANC


- She is puzzled.  She hears the positiveness of what the school offers, but she also sees the negative way the school goes about doing their business.


- A few years ago the school mentioned that they were not going to expand.  But here they are, wanting to expand again.


- All the programs sound good and the people are good, but this is not the way to treat a neighborhood.


- There should be an enrollment cap on this institution.


(+) Greg Gaar - HANC


- He has a really good relationship with Urban School.


- He really likes the school but there is still a community.  


- He is just asking for a cap so that there are no more expansions.


(-) Calvin Welch - Haight Ashbury Neighborhood Council


- HANC opposes the proposed expansion of Urban School for the following reasons:  1) This is the third expansion of the school, and it was done without any community discussion; 2) while representations have been made to keep the four unit building to the west of the campus (1556 Page Street) for residential use, no binding commitment has been made; 3) the proposed expansion will accommodate a 67 percent increase in students and staff at the site, but there are no new plans for drop off and pick up traffic.


(+) Eileen Adams - Ashbury Children's Foundation


- Her Board has several problems with the project.  The concerns are with asbestos, lead, dust and noise.


- The proposed building will extend deeper than the other building so it will block light into the Children's Foundation.

- The Urban students will be on vacation but her children will not.


(+) Charlotte Worsley


- She is the Dean of Students at the Urban School.


- This is a very unique school that offers a lot to their students.

- He has purchased his lunch at the various businesses in the Haight/Ashbury area.

- The school is continually destroying housing.


(+) Dan Wald


- He was born in San Francisco and was lucky to be educated in both private and public schools.


- He understands the concerns of Urban's impact on the neighborhood and the City but also the issue of how excellent the students become after attending Urban school.


- He asks that the Commission approve this proposal.


(+) Rachel Ehrlich


- She moved to San Francisco in 1992 and has been an affordable housing activist since then.


- It is her belief that Urban School has more than compensated the residents who were evicted.


(+) Isabelle Beekman

Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes. 


The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public comment, the commission is limited to:
