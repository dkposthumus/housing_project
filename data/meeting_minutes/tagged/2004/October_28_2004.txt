(Continued from Regular Meeting of October 21, 2004)


SPEAKER(S):


Jeremy Nelson - Transportation for a Livable City


- He hopes that the Commission sets an aggressive and comprehensive search and if this requires a recruiter then he agrees with that.

Emeric Calman


- Is this search going to include international candidates?


- He heard that depending the budget will base how extensive the search will be.


Marilyn Amini

PUBLIC COMMENT


At this time, members of the public may address the Planning Director Search Subcommittee on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Subcommittee. Each member of the public may address the Subcommittee for up to three minutes.


Emeric Calman


- He commended the Commission.


- He would like to make this process as public as possible.


- He would like to see a flowchart or diagram of the entire process including all the codes about the process.  If a licensed engineer or architect is hired, this person should be part of an American association.  Each association has their own code of ethics.  The code of ethics might make the new director base his/her decisions on those.


Marilyn Amini


- One something is submitted, like a resume, it is public material.  She understands personnel issues but the resumes submitted should be available to the public.  She would like the Commission to clarify this with the City Attorney.


- She would think that the costs of recruitment should come back to the Commission.


City Attorney Cleveland-Knowles stated:


- The Brown Act and the Sunshine Ordinance include explicit exception to the general rule that documents submitted to a public body are disclosable.  The rational for this is the privacy of the applicants.
