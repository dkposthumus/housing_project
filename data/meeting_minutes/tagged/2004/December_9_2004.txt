2.  Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner W. Lee:


Re:  Hunter's Point Shipyard project


- This project was heard last week.


- The next day after the case was approved, there was an article in the newspaper stating that many of the speakers who testified on this case received $10.00 for their testimony.


- To his understanding those who were paid did not testify.


- Those people did not have any bearing on their (the Commission's) vote to approve the project.


Re:  Cases at the Planning Department


- He received information from sponsors stating that some projects have been filed with payment since June and these have still not been assigned a planner.


- He wants to know how many projects have been filed with payment and have not been assigned a planner.


C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


3. Director's Announcements


Re: Balboa Plan from Better Neighborhoods


- The RFP is out and the closing date for that is December 28, 2004.  Staff will hold interviews and make a selection by January 7, 2005.


Re:  Merging of Computers between DBI and Planning


- It is important to do this efficiently.


- There was a meeting last week to prepare for taking the first steps of this merger.


- This housekeeping matter will improve the computer systems.


- A third party will be hired to analyze both systems and determine how they should be merged.
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>


4. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals


BOS - 


Land Use Committee


Re:  Haight Street Neighborhood Commercial District


- The Committee supported legislation that imposes Conditional Use on formula retail in the Haight Street Neighborhood Commercial District.  The Committee voted unanimously to recommend this legislation to the full Board of Supervisors.


Re:  Hunters Point Redevelopment Plan


- This had its first reading last Tuesday and will have its second reading this coming Tuesday.


Re:  Interim Controls on Lower Potrero Hill and Showplace Square


- This item was also unanimously recommended to the full Board but with a few changes:


1) Projects in the pipeline prior to November 23, 2004, will be allowed to continue with their environmental review; 2) ensure that there is a draft EIR by December 1, 2005; 3) hold committee hearings every eight weeks on the Department's progress and two weeks prior to these committee hearings the Department must submit a detailed progress report; 4) To update the 1998 economic analysis.  Staff has told the Board that this analysis will be completed in 90 days.  This analysis will be incorporated into the Land Use Analysis of San Francisco's diverse PDR sectors in lower Potrero Hill.


Re:  Ordinance to Recover Costs for EIRs:


- This item went to the Finance Committee.


- It is now sponsored by Supervisor McGoldrick.


- This ordinance sets up a process where the total cost incurred by the Department in preparing an area plan, including the cost of an EIR, is associated with that area plan.  The total cost of that area plan is then divided by the number of the maximum build out alternatives analyzed in the EIR.


- The hope is to recover 100%.


BOA - 


Re:  144 Willard North Street


- The Commission heard this on May 27, 2004.


- The Commission disapproved the project. 


- The Board of Appeals voted to overturn the Commission's denial.

Re:  Board of Appeals item

- The Board acknowledged that there was a problem and will be researching this week.


- He is requesting that the two building permits that have been issued be suspended and that a third permit be filed for the work underway.

- The MTA is suggesting a parcel tax.

th
 and Alabama

333 FREMONT STREET - 
Public Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Report
 - Assessor's Block 3747, Lot 19 - The proposed project is an 85-foot-tall, eight-story, residential building of approximately 131,340 gross square feet (gsf) consisting of 88 dwelling units and about 88 underground parking spaces. Two existing two-story buildings on the site, which total approximately 30,417 square feet, would be demolished. The 329-333 Fremont Street building, constructed in approximately 1930, contains a basement level, which is accessible from a driveway on Zeno Place.  The smaller, 347-349 Fremont Street Edwin W. Tucker & Co. building constructed in 1913 is a rated historic structure on the California Register of Historic Resources.  The project site is located about mid-block on the eastern side of Fremont Street in the block bounded by Folsom, Fremont, Harrison, and Beale Streets.  Vehicular access to the parking garage would be from Fremont Street on the northern side of the building.  Pedestrian access would be from the south side of the building from a courtyard facing Fremont Street.  The site is within the existing Rincon Hill Special Use District/Residential Sub-District, the RC-4 (Residential/Commercial High-Density) zoning district, and a 200-R height/bulk district, and within the proposed Rincon Hill Mixed Use District, and the proposed 350-R height/bulk district.


Preliminary Recommendation:  Receive Comments. No action required.


Note: Written comments will be received at the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m. on December 14, 2004.


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Reed Bement - Rincon Hill Homeowners Association


- His association has been involved with the development of Rincon Hill.


- The plans are a result of a very open neighborhood process.


- They do not agree with the entire plan.  There is much of it that is good.


- This project is pedestrian oriented.


- The question of what height and bulk is acceptable in the Rincon Hill has not been answered.


(+) Andrew Brooks - 201 Harrison Street/Baycrest Residential Association


- The project does not include family units.


- The EIR should provide for an alternative floor plan.


- It is important that the family units be mapped as 3-bedroom units.


- The project should allow owners the freedom to rent out the third unit as a stand alone 1 bedroom unit, until such time as the owner would need the third bedroom to accommodate an expanding family unit or other needs.


- Housing for families is a crucial element in building a new community at Rincon Hill.


(+) Richard Kaufman 


- He encouraged the Commission to approve this project.


- The project provides much needed housing.  It provides both private and public open space.


- This project is not a tower.


ACTION: No Action Required.
