B. COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
 


8. Commission Comments/Questions


Commission Secretary:


Re:  Planning Commission Meetings in May


- She announced that all hearings in May are closed.


- She requested that as the Commission considers cases today, and if there is a need to continue cases, please keep that in mind.


Commissioner W. Lee:


Re:  Housing Element


- The Housing Element will have a major impact on the City regarding parking and traffic.


- He requested that we invite staff from the Parking and Traffic Department to discuss and answer questions that may impact the Housing Element under their jurisdiction:  the number of registered trucks and cars in the City; the estimated number of people that actually drive from outside of the City into the City; the number of street parking in the City; the number of City owned parking lots and the number of available parking spaces in those parking lots.


- He would also like to know if density is increased regarding housing on major transit routs?  What would be their sense of traffic congestion?


- There is a report in the Chronicle about inclusionary policy in the City and the Bay Area. 


- He requested that staff review this report and report back to the Commission within a month.  


Commissioner Antonini:


Re:  Article in the Chronicle regarding "Suburbs in the City"


- This article described the areas of Ingleside Terrace and Jordan Park and how these areas where the first to build homes with a little more space in between them and were the lots are larger.


- Homes in St. Francis Woods, Sea Cliff, etc were modeled after them.


- The interesting thing about this is that when the Commission looks at housing alternatives, they should also consider this type of housing.


- Many people look to move out of San Francisco because there is a demand for these large houses.


Commissioner Sue Lee:


- A member of the public brought to her attention that there was a published notice announcing a hearing for the Housing Element on April 29.  As far as she knows, the Commission does not meet on that day because it is a fifth Thursday.


- She is wondering how something like this could have happened.  What are the steps to make sure that this is corrected?


Amit Ghosh - Department Staff responded:


- Commissioner Lee is absolutely right.  The Department put an add in the newspaper as a place holder to see if it was possible to hold a hearing.


- They placed the add just to make sure that they could cover the contingency if the Commission decided to hold the hearing but they had a back up plan--they will have an ad published announcing that the date would be moved to May 13, 2004.


Commissioner Bradford Bell:


- She is concerned that there is money being wasted here.  Something [this] could have been done right the first time if there had been better communication.


Commissioner Antonini:


- What is considered an official notice and what is the amount of time to be compliant?


Acting Director Nikitas responded:


- The ads need to run 20 days prior to the hearing.


- By noon of Wednesday, approximately 30 days before the Saturday ad runs, staff needs to email to Los Angeles where the ads are set.  


- The ads typically run in the Independent.  But with items like the Housing Element, where there is a high degree of public interest, staff also publishes ads in other newspapers.


ADDENDUM ITEM:


8a. Presentation from the Office of the City Attorney on the procedures for hiring and releasing the Director of Planning.


Judy Boyajian, Deputy City Attorney


- The purpose of this presentation is to continue the discussions about the legal requirements for the appointment of a Planning Director which began about a year ago.


- The City Attorney recently published a public memorandum concerning the summary of the legal requirements which have been posted on our website.


- The legal rules that apply to the appointment of a Planning Director and the role of the Commission and the Mayor are the same rules that apply to any other department head or Commission.  The Mayor appoints the director of the department form a list of several names provided to him/her by the Commission.


- This is a shared responsibility.  Neither the Mayor nor the Commission can appoint a director on their own.  Neither can act without the other and neither needs to wait for the other.  The Commission can proceed with a search or a discussion about an appointment and the Mayor can do likewise.


SPEAKERS: None


ACTION: None.  At the call of the Chair, the item was continued to May 13, 2004.

9.  (ISABEL WADE:  (415) 621-3260 ext. 114)


NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS COUNCIL PRESENTATION
 - Dr. Isabel Wade, Executive Director of the Neighborhood Parks Council, will discuss the need for an open space plan and the creation of open space zoning that ensures all neighborhoods receive their fair share of green spaces and recreation facilities.  The discussion presents the findings of the Council's year-long study and mapping of existing open space by district and funding allocations through the Open Space Fund over 30 years.


Ms. Isabel Wade gave the following presentation:


- Open space is relevant for the consideration of the Commission because, in addition to the environmental and social benefits, there are important economic benefits.


- They embarked on a study of open space last year in order to identify gaps in the open space system.  They mapped the city with information from various agencies as well as private parks to develop the Green Map.


- She displayed a map of district 6.  Next to district 3, it is the most deficient district of open space in the City.


- They also looked at what the Open Space Fund had done for the last 30 years.


- It is important to set up an open space task force and the Commission should enforce this.


- The Open Space Element of the General plan has not been revised since 1986.  The Commission should request the money to fund the update of this Open Space Element.


- There could also be open space zoning.


- Public space--schools and hospitals, about 400 acres, can be used as open space.


SPEAKER(S):


Marilyn Amini


- The consideration of open space opportunities is very well taken.


- As projects are being approved, they are being reviewed as casting shadows on locations that are already designated open space.


- In the Citywide action plan material which sets forth priorities, it states that streets, because of the proposed increase density, will function as public open space.


- It is important to analyze what open space is available.


ACTION: None.  Informational only.

Supervisor Dufty


- He commended the Planning Department staff for their hard work on this plan.


- He also thanked the various agencies that provided input to this report.


- He attended neighborhood meetings and invited Ms. Levine to participate in this process.

Dan Tuttle


- He lives in Glen Park.

- She went to the community process on the very last day.


- It is very important that someone reaches out to them.  They mostly drive their cars.  The MUNI line that goes through there is not very reliable.  Because of the location of where they live, it is hard for people to walk up and down the hill with children.

Mathew Bittleston


- He lives in Glen Park.


- He is very happy to see this plan and thanked everyone who has worked on it.


- His only concerns are about what the emphasis are on the traffic studies.  Pedestrian safety and reduced automobile speeds need to be emphasized in these studies.


- This is a very central public transportation area so reducing parking is good.


- Putting bike lanes on San Jose Avenue is a good idea.

Elise Ravel


- A tremendous amount of work was put into this plan.


- She lives in Glen Park.
