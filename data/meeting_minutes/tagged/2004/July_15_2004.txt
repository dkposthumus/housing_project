REQUIRED SECOND MEANS OF EGRESS
 - Ordinance Amending the San Francisco Planning Code to Allow a Required Second Means of Egress 
Adoption of an ordinance amending the San Francisco Planning Code
 by adding a new section 136(c)(4)(A)(i-v) to allow certain stairways that are a required second means of egress under the Building Code, as permitted obstructions in the rear yard. The California Building Code no longer allows fire escapes as a second means of egress in most cases. This proposed text amendment provides an exemption to meet the requirements of the Building Code. This ordinance also includes changes to Section 311 and 312 to require neighbor notification for the addition of these stairways.


Preliminary Recommendation: Recommend approval of the ordinance to the Board of Supervisors.

7.  Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner Sue Lee:


Re:  Position of Planning Director


- She requested that an item be placed on the agenda to discuss a process for reviewing the position of planning director, evaluating the director's performance, determining qualifications for the position and recruiting and considering potential candidates.


- She would like to have this item scheduled when all six Commissioners are present or at the meeting of August 5, 2004.  Commissioner Bradford Bell is aware of this.  She [President Bradford Bell] has formed a committee of three to follow through on some of the search and recruitment activities in between the meetings.  The members of this committee would be Commissioner Bradford Bell, Commissioner Antonini and myself.  She [President Bradford Bell] designated Commissioner Hughes as an alternate to this committee.


Commissioner William Lee:


Re:  City Stat


- Next week the Planning Department is scheduled to begin the first City Stat meeting.  He would like to see copies of the information that is provided to the Mayor's office so they are on the "same page."  The City is to provide a spreadsheet of the number of people that are out on sick leave, the number of days that are taken off, the people on vacation, the number of FTEs in the department, and the number of contracts that the department puts out.


Re: Controls or Policies [for the Mission]


- He was taken by the item because he expected to hear the item and he felt that the Planning Staff was not given the opportunity to voice their concerns.  Is there a communication issue between the staff and the Commission? Could this be addressed during the Director's Report or right after Commission comments?


Commissioner Antonini:


Re:  Letter from Toby Levine


- There is a letter from her regarding the Interim rules.  She had a lot of practical and thoughtful remarks.


- The practicality he found was very good.


Re: Request Previously Made


- There was a request by Mary Murphy in February regarding whether these controls are applicable under state law.  He has not received an opinion from that.


SPEAKER(S):


Amit Ghosh


Thank you for giving us this opportunity which was denied us at the last hearing.  Two weeks ago in an exaggerated public gesture the Commission sited incomplete and inadequate staff work as the reason for continuing action on the interim rules for the Eastern Neighborhoods.  Everyone present at the hearing was allowed to speak except for staff.  Commissioners, I am ready to accept all responsibility for staff work and performance under my supervision and my record is clear on that and speaks for itself.  However, I am completely puzzled as to what lapses there might have been on staff's part.  I have therefore asked staff to prepare an account and chronology of events, Commission requests and staff responses that pertain to the hearing of two weeks ago on the Eastern Neighborhood Rules.


Johnny Jaramillo


We would basically like to clarify any miscommunication so that a decision can be made on September 2, 2004.  To that end, we are presenting this statement of facts:


On March 25, Commission President Bell asked to reopen the matter of setting Interim Zoning Rules for the Mission.  Commissioner Bell expressed urgency and requested staff to schedule meetings with Commissioners.  Following these meetings, a hearing by the Commission was scheduled for June 3 and a staff memorandum containing the proposed interim rules was submitted to the Commission on May 27.  On July 1, the hearing on the Mission Zoning Rules were again continued, this time to September 2.  On June 3, the scheduled meeting was continued to July 1, though no reason was provided for the continuance.  The commissioners had at least a month to review the proposed rules.  On the matter of the Commissioner's requests--which Commissioner Bell falsely accused the staff of not fulfilling and therefore holding back Commission action on the interim rules for the Mission--we would like to respond as follows:  At the May 14 meeting with staff, Commissioner Sue Lee requested a new map of the Eastern Neighborhoods larger than that provided at the February 12 hearing showing the Interim Zoning Policies applying to the Eastern Neighborhood.  Copies of this larger map was submitted to Commissioners on June 24.  On June 3, Commissioner Antonini requested staff carry out exit interviews with firms that have left San Francisco.  He provided a list for staff to contact on June 9.  The survey of former San Francisco businesses was submitted to Commissioner Antonini on June 29.  On June 3, Commissioner Sue Lee requested a list of projects that have been pending since Interim Policies were adopted.  This list was prepared but staff was not able to submit this at the July 1 hearing.  Commissioner Sue Lee later clarified her map request.  This time asking for a map that shows only the three overlays discussed at the February 12 hearing.  A new map was prepared and was to be submitted at the Commission hearing on July 1 but again staff was not allowed to do so.  It was not until July 1 when the continuance to September 2 was proposed that it was made public that the postponement was on account of staff's proposed inability to comply with the Commission's request for additional information.  Commissioner Bell even rebuffed and denied staff's attempt to respond to this accusation.  In addition, at the July 1 hearing, Commissioner Antonini restated his earlier request to staff regarding new PDR firms that have recently started or recently relocated to San Francisco.  We would like to remind the Commission that staff has fulfilled this request to the extent possible.  At various times including at the pubic hearing on February 12, staff has stated that a detailed list of business names from the assessors office is confidential information.  As we have already informed the Commission, this assertion is backed up by consultations with the City Attorney's Office.  We would like to call to the Commission's attention, that by the time of the September 2 hearing, some 23 weeks and almost 6 months will have elapsed since Commissioner Bell reopened the case.  San Francisco deserves effective planning.  If there are errors in our understanding and responsiveness to the Commission, we hope that the ensuing dialogue will clarify these points to ensure that on September 2 a decision will be made.  Policies or Controls, the decision is yours to make.  If you don't like the language in the proposed Interim Rules, you can change it.  If you disagree with staff's recommendation on where to apply the different interim zones, you can change the maps as well.  It is within your power to do so.  A decision on the small interim step, lasting a mere 18 months, must be made if permanent zoning is ever to be adopted.  Thank you.


Miriam Chion


You have heard that our last hearing on the Eastern Neighborhoods has left us extremely concerned about our professional standards and our ability to plan for the City.  The statement that the Commission made about staff's inability to provide information, and that being the reason for continuance, comes to us as a surprise and also as a major disappointment.  We felt and we believe we have responded to the Commission's request.  You have asked for maps, we have provide maps.  You have asked for data, we have provided data.  We have provided all the information that we are allowed to provide you within the legal boundaries that the City Attorney has established for us.  There are additional requests that will be delivered to you as soon as we can.  After the adoption of the Interim policies on February 12 for the Eastern Neighborhoods, we have prepared specific interim rules for the Mission for the June hearing, we did not hear any comments or questions on that report.  After that, we revised and added some minor changes as stated before and a few changes in the language to allow for greatest development flexibility.  The complaint from the Commission, we believe, was aggravated by the acting Director's inability to take responsibility for the reports we release.  We believe that the director is responsible for any report released by the department.  He can choose to stop the release of a report as it has been done before many times.  The Director cannot instruct staff to prepare a memo and then remove his name from such document.  The false use of staff performance as an excuse to delay the process once more is not acceptable professional standards.  This working condition is not acceptable to staff not only because of our ethical and professional standards but also because the City and our communities are severely impacted by our dysfunctional planning process.  Commissioners, we have spent by now seven years trying to rezone the Eastern Neighborhoods.  We have spent probably by now hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars.  We have generated thousands of pounds of reports.  Many families have left the City.  Many businesses have left the City.  Many developers have lost money.

Re: Continuance


Marilyn Amini


- When there is a General Plan amendment proposed, Section 302 requires that there be a publication of intent to initiate.  There has not been a publication of intent to initiate.


- There is an article in the Independent which is only an announcement of the hearing.


- There are proposed changes to Article 7.


- Many uses are addressed and the public has the right to respond to a change of use.

- This project will set in motion everything that they have been fighting against.


(+/-) Jim Salinas


- This is a neighborhood he knows very well.


- This neighborhood is in transition and he fully understands what the neighbors are saying.

- The location is a permitted use as an art/event center/gallery.


- The events will mostly be:  large corporate clients, product launches, forums for meetings, community outreach programs, think tanks, fundraisers for non-profit events, etc.


(+) Jacqueline Burns


- This project would reach out to private, corporate, and artists.
