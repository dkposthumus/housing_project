829 FOLSOM STREET
 - 
south side 
          between 4th and 5th Streets, a through lot to Shipley Street; Lot 091 
          in Assessor's Block 3752 - 
Requests for Variances.
 
          The proposal is to construct a nine-story, mixed-use building with up 
          to 69 dwelling units, up to 5,000 gross square feet of ground floor 
          commercial space and a 62-space parking garage. A rear yard modification 
          is sought under Section 134(e) to provide rear yard open space within 
          an inner court and on a 7th floor setback of 10-15 feet along Shipley 
          Street. A variance is sought from dwelling unit exposure requirements, 
          as the horizontal dimensions of the inner court do not meet the requirements 
          for an open area as defined under Section 140(a)(2) for dwelling unit 
          exposure, and 27 of the 70 units have no exposure other than this inner 
          court. The site is within an RSD (Residential/Service) Mixed-Use District, 
          and a 40-X/85-B Height and Bulk District.

B. COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
 








2. Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner William Lee:


Re: 170 St. Germain 


- He requested input from either the Planning Department or the Building 
        Department regarding the demolition and if it was done in compliance from 
        the permits issued.


- He received another letter form Walter Kapland again mentioning that 
        the contractor exceeded the scope of work.


- What are the procedures on having a re-hearing?




Deputy City Attorney Cleveland-Knowles responded:


- There is no existing provision in the Planning Code for a rehearing 
          or a reconsideration of an item and there are no provisions specifically 
          in the Planning Commission rules.


- The Planning Department continues to have jurisdiction over the building 
          permit until the Planning Department sends it back to the Building Department.


- If the Commission would like to schedule the item again, they can. 
        


- This calendar would have to be noticed within it's regular time.


Director Green responded:


- The statement that was made at the hearing when this item was heard 
          is not true--that the Building Department has not resolved work previous 
          to what was presented at the Commission.


- He believes that if these issues influenced the Commission's vote, 
          the Commission can decide to bring this back before them at a future 
          date.


- He does not know how the Building Department has answered these allegations.


- He will speak to the City Attorney to see what abilities he has to 
          hold this permit.




Commissioner Antonini:


Re: Legality of Reinstitution of Controls in the Mission Area.


- He will be receiving an answer regarding this issue.


- He will report on this in the future.


Commissioner Hughes:


Re: 170 St. Germain


- If he understood correctly, the Commission has the right to reschedule 
        a case that had previously been heard by the Commission.








Director Green responded:


- The Commission has the right to reschedule an item.








Commissioner Hughes:


- So the Commission could rescind it's decision, take the item off calendar, 
        etc.?


- He recommends that the item be scheduled on the October 7, 2004 calendar.


- The basis of the request is that if this is a frivolous assertion or 
        it has merit, the commission needs to decide on this case dependent upon 
        the facts.


Commission Antonini:


- If some resolution is found prior to that date, the project should 
        not be held up because of the calendared item.




Director Green responded:


- This would be a tough call for the Planning Department because staff 
          will be preparing for a hearing, dealing with the Building Department 
          and trying to find out what is the case regarding the other permit because 
          the permit in question was not the permit that was before the Commission. 
          It would be difficult to make a decision prior to the suggested calendared 
          date.


- It is important to wait to the calendared date so that the Commission 
          is prepared and ready to take an action.




Commission Antonini:


- He just wants to make sure that the Commission is not crossing jurisdictions.


Commissioner Hughes:


- This affords both parties the opportunity to review the tapes and make 
        a transcript of them.




Director Green responded:


- If it is the desire of the Commission to calendar this for reconsideration 
          on October 7, 2004, staff can present on September 2, under director's 
          report the information we are aware of at that time. The Commission 
          can acknowledge if this is something they need to reconsider or if it 
          is something that has been resolved and no longer needs to be heard. 
          Scheduling this on September 2, would allow the Commission and staff 
          to engage in a dialog and contact the individual who made these statements.




Commissioner Sue Lee:


- This is fine with her but she does not want this to become a precedent 
        for other case, or to become a tactic to delay cases.


Commissioner William Lee:


- There are a lot of issues in various cases that have been decided upon 
        by the Commission so he wants to find out what the truth is on this case.




Director Green responded:


- He wants to be clear that the issue here is whether or not what the 
          Commission heard is truthful or not.

Request for 
a Determination of Compliance

(+) James Stewart - Hastings College of Law


- They support this project and feel that it will help revitalize the neighborhood.


- It will also provide housing for the students of Hastings College.


(+) Richard Almond


- He has been involved in housing in the tenderloin.


- This project provides good housing options for downtown financial services.


- It provides housing for people to take their first step in the business world.


- The developers have given every indication that they care for the neighborhood.


(+) Jeremy Nelson - TLC


- They support an off street parking Variance and one-to-one bicycle paring.


- This project is quite adequate since it provides more housing than parking.


- Housing units without car parking are more affordable.


- They requested that the project sponsor work collaboratively with DPT and DPW to enliven the expansive right of way since it is not a standard sidewalk width.  This could be done through the use of landscaping, street trees, pedestrian scaled lighting, seating, special pavement treatments, etc.


- He suggested that they provide bicycle parking as well.


ACTION: Approved with Conditions as Amended: 1) The BMR units required as part of the inclusionary ordinance would not be the units that are adjacent to the deepest portions of the light well.

83 McALLISTER STREET
 - south side between Leavenworth Street and 7th Street N., Lot 32, in Assessor's Block 351
 - 
Request for 
dwelling unit exposure and parking variances 
for the subject property, which is in the C-3-G Zoning District and a 80-X Height and Bulk District.  The Zoning Administrator will hear the variance application concurrently with the Planning Commission. The proposal is to seismically upgrade the subject five-story office building (The Methodist Book Concern, a contributor to the Civic Center Historic District, and a Category I Building under the Downtown Plan); and convert the existing office use to approximately 60 small dwelling units, with ground floor retail and lobby space, and supporting residential services on the basement level.  No parking would be provided, and no exterior alterations to character-defining facades are proposed, therefore no Certificate of Appropriateness would be required for this project.


SPEAKER(S): See Speakers for Item 11a.


ACTION: Acting Zoning Administrator closed the public hearing and believes there are grounds for granting the variance and will recommend that the Zoning Administrator do so.  He will also recommend that the designation of units be mixed throughout and at least 10 bicycle parking spaces be added to the project.

Request for Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit Application No. 
 
2004 0310 8295, to construct horizontal and vertical additions to the existing one family dwelling including a full third story and a rear extension in an RH-2 (Residential House, Two Family) District, and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.    


Preliminary Recommendation: Do Not Take Discretionary Review and approve the project as proposed.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of July 22, 2004)


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Donna Hitchens - Discretionary Review Requestor


- She has lived here for 25 years.  The primary light and air is on the side that faces the project and it will be blocked.


- This is really an issue of the light and air available to their home.


- She realizes that the project sponsor has the right to renovate and make a profit.


- They set up a meeting with the project sponsor after the last continuance.  They made an offer and have not received a counter offer from them.


(-) Bob Baum - Project Architect


- The developer does not comply with Prop M or the Residential Design Guidelines.


- There is more than one neighbor who opposes the project.


- He displayed diagrams of the project showing that the proposed project is not comparable in height and bulk.


- They have prepared a model which displays a project that is in compliance with the Residential Design Guidelines and consists of good neighbor policies.


(-) Mark Madsen


- He lives on 30
th
 Street.


- He has a business at home and relies on the light coming into his work area.


- He does not oppose to the remodel but he does oppose the size and bulk of it.


- The developers will not be their neighbors since they will just remodel and leave.  The neighbors have a long time interest in the area.


(-) JoAnne Madsen


- They have made improvement to their home keeping within the neighbors wishes.


- They enjoy natural light in four bedrooms.  This light really opens up the house and makes it look larger and warmer.


- Their picturesque windows will look into a wall.


- They will loose much of the charm and appeal of their home.


- Her garden has been a tenure project for many years.


- The project sponsor has continued with their project with disregard to the issues exposed by the neighbors.


- Please preserve the neighborhood and her garden by not approving this proposal.


(-) Claire Piltcher


- She funded Friends of Noe Valley about 30 years ago.


- She has worked closely with [many] developers and she has concerns.  The revised Residential Design Guidelines are not being met (and knows the older version by heart).


- This is clearly a demolition and it is happening all over the city.


- If there isn't some relief given to these neighbors, they will have to appeal the decision.


- The DR requestors have not been given the opportunity for a light well or a set back.


(-) Darlene Crisp


- She has lived in the neighborhood for many years.


- This project conflicts with the City's Master Plan.


- This massive construction will increase the rental rate and selling price for properties.


- The size of the building is completely out of scale with the neighborhood.


- The massive expansion in the rear yard will block sunlight to the neighbors.


- If one lived next door to this project, one would not like to have their lifestyle affected.


(-) Jace Levinson


- The impact will be detrimental.


- This proposal is just too huge and it will impact the adjacent building.


- While the Planning Code allows the size of this project, it is not required.


(-) Tom Mogensen - Upper Noe Neighbors


- They support the Discretionary Review because the project does not respect the character of the neighborhood.


- It seems that the matter here is not having bedrooms but how big these bedrooms should be.


- He suggests that the Commission take Discretionary Review.


(+) John Sanger - Representing the Project Sponsor


- Often when there is a renovation, it will impact the adjacent neighbors in some way.


- The project will extend 13 feet in the rear and will be set back.


- A neighbor did a similar project in 2002 and it did not include a setback.


- The Residential Design Guidelines allows what is being proposed.


- The project will not have an intrusion in the mid block open space.


(+) James Aaron - Project Architect


- The intent of the project was to not impact the neighbors.


- He has not had an opportunity to view the model that was presented by the Discretionary Review requestor's representative so he has not been able to verify the scale.


- The project has a very convectional design.


(+) Joe O'Donaghue


- Staff approved this project not because of developer power.


- His house is right next to a very blank wall.  We live in a city so it is hard to avoid these types of situations.


- If this situation was really about light and air, the way the project is being designed, this has no impact at all.


- Many of the neighbors in Noe Valley are not here and they are not here for a reason.


(+) Mark McGee - Project Sponsor


- He is not going to apologize for what he does.


- He is not a developer.


- He just wants to remodel a house.


- He hopes that the Commission sees that they are just trying to make a living.


(+) Richie Hart - Residential Builders Association


- He has known the Project Sponsor for many years.


- What they are asking is very reasonable.


- There is a housing crisis and this project will increase housing.


- He strongly recommends that the Commission approve this project.


(+) Jim Keith - Residential Builders Association


- If the DR requestor's logic prevails, they would not be able to live in the house that they live in.


- The idea that the Project Sponsor's project impacts light and air is not adequate.


- Many people support this project and he hopes that the Commission will support it as well.


(+) Joe Cassidy


- He has been building in Noe Valley for many years.


- There is always a fight.


- He knows the Project Sponsor and knows that they are building a great project.


(+) Grace Shanahan


- The McGees are long time builders in the Noe Valley area and they are very respectful of what they build.


- She encourages the Commission to support the project.


(+) Dave O'Keiff


- He has built small projects in the area.


- It seems that when someone remodels or builds a larger home it automatically becomes a monster home.


- Many neighbors are more than happy with this project because it will increase their property value.


- He hopes that this is not just a view issue.


(+) Reed Caroll


- The project is comparable to other projects.


- The project is consistent with adjacent properties.


- This project should be applauded and supported instead of being rejected.


(+) Sean Keigran


- This project is one aspect of an overall housing crisis.


- Communities should accept all types of houses.


- If the housing crisis needs to be solved, all housing projects should be accepted.


- He has not heard anything that is substantial at this hearing.

- He feels that the proposed project is out of character with the rest of the homes.


- He met with the project sponsor and suggested they eliminate the penthouse and have a flat roof therefore constructing a second floor.


- This project will be intrusive.


(+) Ray Stephen - Project Sponsor


- The DR requestor states that he was not able to meet with him.  He has had many meetings with the DR requestor.

Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the demolition permit.


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Alice Barkley - Project Sponsor


- She is available for questions.


(-) Jeremy Nelson - Transportation for a Livable City


- They strongly support this project because it follows the Planning Code with respect to residential car parking.  The parking provides the potential for one-to-one residential bicycle parking which will be secure in the garage as well as add 108 additional units of market rate affordable car free and car light housing.


- The only issue they have is the inclusion of the 10 non accessory commercial project spaces in the project.  They oppose this because the project is located in an excellent local and regional transit services area.


- The width of the driveway should be narrowed as well.


(+) Charles Breidinger - Project Sponsor


- This building has been vacant since 1999.


- One of the employees tried to resurrect the business but was unsuccessful.

(-) John (did not state last name)


- He urged the Commission to take Discretionary Review because the code is not clear and final.


- He would like to substantially reduce the project and not allow the open space Variance.


- Once this project is up, there will be a lot of transition.  He feels that there will be larger traffic and parking issues.


- He feels that not all of the operational issues have been discussed.


- He hopes that the Commission will take Discretionary Review.


(-) Teresa Beltramo


- She lives on Townsend Street and is a business owner.


- She opposes the project for the same reasons as the previous speaker.


- This area has a lot of tourists and this type of use is not adequate for the area.


(-) Sue Hestor


- The PDR uses are slowly being pushed out.

- He welcomes social economic diversity in this neighborhood.


- There is a need for SROs.

Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and approve the project with modifications.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of June 17, 2004)


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Steve Williams - Representing Discretionary Review Requestor


- He agrees with the determination by staff.


- For six years, staff has been telling the developer to remove the 4
th
 floor and match the light-wells, yet the developer has not agreed to it.


- This developer has caused the department to spend a lot of money.


- This project even got to the point of being cancelled.


- He would actually want to have the project cancelled in order to stop serial applications.


(-) Jack Norton - Discretionary Review Requestor


- He was born and raised in the neighborhood and his mother (91 years old) lives across the street.


- The proposed project does not meet the Residential Design Guidelines.


- According to the Architectural Heritage Foundation, his house was the first to be built on that block.


- The proposed project would be the largest on the block.  It is too large and will overwhelm and denigrate their home.


- All buildings surrounding the project are only two stories.


- There are various neighborhood organizations who do not support the project.


(-) Loren Lopin


- He lives in the neighborhood.


- Six planners have recommended to revise the project and eliminate the fourth floor and provide good neighbor gestures.


- He asked the members of the audience who oppose this project to stand up (about 20 people stood up).


(-) Dennis Estrada


- He has lived in the Richmond District for 35 years.


- He is representing the 21
st
 Avenue Coalition and they agree to the recommendations provided by staff.


(-) Julian Hultgren


- He lives on 21
st
 Avenue and is against this project.


- He believes that eliminating the 4
th
 floor would be much more in keeping with the neighborhood.


- There is an apartment building on the block and it is only three stories.


- Limiting the project to three stories would make it more compatible with the neighborhood.


(-) Marjorie Norton


- She is 91 years old.  She has lived across the street from the proposed house since 1912.


- She opposes the four story building because it is big and out of character with the neighborhood.


- She urges the Commission to limit the project to three stories.


(-) Edwina Cherrington


- She has lived across the street from the proposed project since the 1960s.


- The subject project is an exact replica of her home.


- The four story modern building is too large.


- It is another "Richmond Special"


- She asks the "professional" developer to limit the project to three stories and retain the façade.


(-) Hiroshi Fukuda - Richmond Community Association


- He feels that "alterations" are sometimes deceptive.  This has major alterations.


- Families are leaving San Francisco because there are not enough single-family homes.


- Thousands of homes have been taken off the market.


- Recent studies have indicated that San Francisco is behind in providing housing.  


- This project is not going to help people who need moderate housing.


(+) Jerod Eigerman - Reuben and Junius


- The project sponsor is not a professional developer.


- The project is code compliant.


- He has no knowledge of any agreement with Jake McGoldrick.


- Discretionary Review is for extraordinary circumstances.  Good neighbor gestures have been made in this case.


- What they are asking for is not outlandish.


- There is nothing in the guidelines that states that if there is one building on one side you cannot build higher.


- There is no peculiar hardship because they are on the south side.


(+) Reza Khoshnevisan - Project Architect


- Regarding the demolition, if a floor were to be added, the entire foundation would have to be replaced.


- There is no way that the fourth floor would be visible.


- He is available if the Commission has any questions.


ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and approve the project with the following conditions:  The modifications included:


· Eliminate the fourth floor;


· Continue the side setback at the rear of the southern side down to the roof of the ground level to match the existing setback and allow for light and air to the DR Requestor's window;


· Provide an interior connection between the "Common Room" on the first floor (garage level) and the second floor; and


· Require an NSR be recorded to restrict the "Common Room" on the first floor from becoming an illegal unit.
