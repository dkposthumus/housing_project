Commissioner Antonini:


I happened to visit a dental lab that relocated their business on Bryant Street.
 
 They bought the property there.
 
 That is both good news and bad news.
 
 The good news is that they displaced a dotcom, and the bad news is that it's Match.com and they are in Huston now.
 
 The dental lab was happy to get that but they commented regarding Match.com leaving San Francisco that the extraordinary fees and costs forced them, and that if they could do the same thing they would think about relocating, but unfortunately they have a base of dentists that they have to be close to.
 
 The bottom line is you have to be cognizant of & 
 
 This is a good subject for maybe the Grand Jury that what we do extraordinarily in San Francisco that makes this such an expensive place to do business that we have to raise extraordinary fees and licenses and then of course people move and there is less revenue coming in and we don't have the money to meet the expenses that we want to provide.
 
 The other think is that I happened to walk by 901 Bush – they are condos and are almost all sold.
 
 Either because of the circumstances surrounding this or the economy, they had all of these condo units, without parking I might add which results in lower prices, ranged from the low 300s to nothing beyond $400,000 with the exception of one unit.
 
 I was thinking that if we had more of these, we would have more opportunity of low income housing to be purchased.
 
 It goes along with a thought I had some months ago that perhaps having some sort of trade off where an owner of a property could put some of their market rate units for rent under rent control in return for some conversions of condo properties.
 
 It's something we have to look at and think creatively about ways to renovate buildings that are very expensive to renovate and also keep the stock of rent controlled housing in place.


Commissioner Olague:


At some point I'd like to know what the status of Bryant Square Project.
 
 I understand that it has changed and I believe there were certain agreements the project sponsor had made with the community.


Commissioner Miguel:


In the past week I met with people from Natoma Street and Grenard Terrace.
 
 I also attended the meeting of the Japantown Task Force and have been interfacing with many of the individuals who are involved with that project. 
 
I had been asked and participated by leading one of the sections of a joint full morning meeting with SPUR, the Planning Department, and the Neighborhood Parks Council regarding the Recreation and Open Space Element of the General Plan.
 
 I also participated in a panel on housing, particularly affordable housing, with an expanded group from the CORO Foundation.


Commissioner Borden:


I had the pleasure of participating in something called Urbiadventure (?)
 
 It is very new, an adventure that a couple works in the Presidio who does nature tours there.
 
 It's designing nature tours for different neighborhoods of the city to get kids in touch with the nature directly in communities.
 
 The first four started at the 15
th
 and Moraga stairs and took you around the nature in that area.
 
 I thought it was a really great new endeavor of taking people and families around different parts of the city and to appreciate the nature that lives within them.
 
 I thought it was a great way to introduce us to more aspects of the city – looking at the natural environment and not just the built one.

 DIRECTOR'S REPORT

 Director's Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


I just wanted to give you an update on the Department's Action Plan, which is the package of reforms and our procedures.
 
 We had an advisory committee meeting this week and we had a very interesting discussion about two of the proposed items on our Action Plan.
 
 One is a pre-application process that we are proposing that would provide early initial feedback in a very short timeframe to project sponsors – getting all divisions of the Department together to review a project and provide initial feedback.
 
 This is a process that we think will save time and money in the long run over the life of a project.
 
 The second thing we talked about is our proposed reforming and revising of our internal design review procedures similar to the pre-ap.
 
 The idea is that there will be an early design read on projects so that we would be able to give early design feedback to sponsors.
 
 Both of those generated some interesting discussion, but I think ultimately the advisory committee was supportive of the direction.
 
 We are going to continue to revise it and we will be giving you an update on the overall Action Plan in the next few weeks.


Acting Zoning Administrator Nikitas:


The Board of Appeals did meet yesterday but there were no cases that had been before this commission so I have nothing to report now.

Informational presentation on the Branch Library Improvement Program


C of A for 3150 Sacramento Street – a library that included patching the terra cotta columns.
 
 This was passed requiring a maintenance plan for the terra cotta patch work.


HPC Committee met to hear the Japantown Better Neighborhood Plan.
 
 Only two of the three members of the Committee were able to stay long enough to express their concerns (Damkroger and Martinez).
 
 The recommendation of the HPC Commission to the Planning Commission is that the Planning Commission not endorse the Plan yet.
 
 They expressed that while endorsement is not adoption, it is a strong indication of support.
 
 They were very supportive of the process, but do not believe the Plan is ready for endorsement at this time.
