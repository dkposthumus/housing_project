 Commission Comments/Questions




Inquiries/Announcements
.
 
 Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).


Future Meetings/Agendas
.
 
 At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.




 


Commissioner Miguel:


 
 -
 
 He thanked his fellow commissioners for their confidence in him (to act as President of the Commission).
 
 Also thanked Director Rahaim and Secretary Avery for their help over the last few months.
 
 He presented immediate past President Olague with a gift.


Commissioner Antonini:




He mentioned that he spoke with Mr. Salinas and Mr. Roka and that the Commission will take the matter up next week.




Commissioner Moore:




We have little or no time to pat ourselves on the back so would like to congratulate Commissioners Miguel and Olague on their elections.
 
 The two make a unique pair. The two of them is what we need.
 
 The institutional knowledge of Christina Olague is so incredibly valuable that I believe this is a great combination.




Commissioner Olague:




I just want to thank Ms. Avery, Director Rahaim, Mr. Badiner, and others for working with us.
 
 I think we have a really excellent commission.
 
 We bring broad experience that is represented here and I'm happy to be serving with everyone here.
 
 It was a good year.
 
 It's rare to see a Latino woman in the type of leadership position that I was able to take on last year.
 
 I'm happy I was able to represent women of color in that position.
 
 I also wanted to thank former (Board) President Peskin who reappointed me to that position and showed a lot of support for me when I was President last year.
 
 There were people in the Mayor's Office who were also very open and we were able to discuss and work on issues over the past year that brought some new integrity to the Commission where we tried to rise above the politics and focus on policy.
 
 I think we are a good example of regardless of where your politics are you can still have a lot of respect for each other and work harmoniously and bring about what's best in the areas we represent for the city.
 
 We always find a way to rise above our differences and I look forward to continue working together the next couple of years and I hope we continue to do what's best for the city.
 
 Thank you all.




 


 


Commissioner Lee:




I want to also acknowledge Commissioner Olague.
 
 Last year I think we set a record for the number of meetings – over 50 plus meetings.
 
 We actually passed through 4 area plans that encompasses a good 40 percent of the city.
 
 A lot was very contentious.
 
 What is very important about Commissioner Olague, we may differ but we have always gotten along.
 
 Commissioner Antonini and I are the only two left from the original Charter change.
 
 We all have our quirks, but we work well together.
 
 As I go through the history of the Planning Department, nothing has ever been accomplished as much as under the leadership of Christina Olague.
 
 Christina, thank you so much.
 
 I look forward to the leadership from Mr. Ron Miguel and as long as you listen to Linda Avery I know you'll do well.




Commissioner Sugaya:




There's not too much to add, but congratulations.




Commissioner Moore:




I was going to continue the love fest as well.
 
 It's been a real pleasure for me.
 
 As everyone knows I am the most recently appointed commissioner.
 
 Everyone kept saying  are you crazy for joining the Planning Commission – it's so horrible? 
 
 But I have to say that it's been an amazing pleasure, especially under the leadership of Christina, and Ron as the vice chair.
 
 It's been a wonderful experience, far exceeding my expectations.
 
 The feedback you've gotten from the general public as well as from up here is really genuine.
 
 We have a mutual respect and admiration for each other even when we don't always agree.
 
 Christina always handled this Commission with grace and dignity.
 
 I thank both Christina and Ron and I look forward to another year working with this Commission.




Commissioner Antonini:




In keeping with the other comments – I think in my time on the Commission I've served under three other presidents and they all did an excellent job. 
 
But I think in keeping with what Commissioner Bill Lee just said, we accomplished more last year than we did in the whole seven years I've been on the Commission and I think a lot of it has to go to Christina Olague.
 
 I think she is fair, she is accessible, she is dedicated and most of all she is friendly and I think that is a wonderful person to have.
 
 I look forward to working with President Miguel and do even more this year.




Commissioner Sugaya:




I met with Moses Corrette of Planning staff in the Survey Section last night and I received a briefing on the Market & Octavia Survey, which I believe will be coming to the Commission in the future.
 
 I would just remind the Commissioners that if they would like to have a briefing on the survey, which has gone through a number of different iterations and has changed a bit since the original survey work was done – and it's still on going – Mr. Corrette is more than willing to do so, and since he works into the evening, he is more than willing do it after hours if you want to take advantage of that.


Secondly, I'm reminded that one of the conditions on the Pacific Telephone building was that the replacement windows would match the existing windows.
 
 In talking to the architects and the conservators who worked on the Sutter Street building, which was cited by the project sponsors as an example, they reminded me that those aluminum windows in that building match exactly the steel window profiles.
 
 I just want to put that into the record.




Commissioner Borden:




It's a shame that our calendars are slowing down because of the reduction in building permits throughout the city, but one of the things we've talked about is maybe having hearings on neighborhoods throughout the city where maybe we do a deep dive – look at neighborhood commercial (NC) corridors; look at residential corridors - all throughout the city - and have hearings.
 
 Bring in the Mayor's Office of Economic and Workforce Development to give us the economic development lay-of-the-land; bring in the neighborhood groups and really do a deep dive into a neighborhood.
 
 I think it would be great if we started with some of the lesser talked about neighborhoods first and moved our way in to the more popular neighborhoods that we dealt with in the last year.
 
 But this is a real opportunity for us to have a great dialogue and bring in the community and talk about what their needs are in all the different neighborhoods and how we can help facilitate some positive growth and development that people would like to see in San Francisco.




Commissioner Moore:




First, I'd like to respond to Commissioner Borden's suggestion because I think in its intent it is a very important one.
 
 What I would like to do though is tie that into quadrant leaders and planners who are experts within those general areas so that there is notification between neighborhood groups and Planning (Department) so that they are better prepared.
 
 It's not a stand alone conversation.
 
 It is a broader informed dialog between all groups


Second, I'd like to talk about the letter we received from Mr. Vettel regarding 3400 Cesar Chavez labor issues and the comments that were made last week in our discussion about the Pagoda Theatre.
 
 I assume that everybody read the letter.
 
 I just want to make sure that the public knows that indeed labor and hiring practices by Pagoda developer and 3400 Cesar Chavez developer are in line with what the agreements are.
 
 That needs to be communicated to commissioners and to the public.

 DIRECTOR'S REPORT


 




Director's Announcements




 


 
 
Director Rahaim
:




On the budget, we are working to gather the data on the first half of the fiscal year.
 
 The Mayor has asked us to submit the budget a little early this year.
 
 We have scheduled three hearings before you for the first three weeks in February.
 
 During those hearings we will bring the budget to you with our goals for the year.




Zoning Administrator Badiner




Congratulations to both of you and the work you've done over the last year


On Discretionary Review (DR) reform – at the December 11 hearing, we presented the first phase of the DR reform and the Department's thoughts and proposals from that.
 
 We heard from the Commission that we should hold further meetings with the neighborhoods to understand any proposals they may have.
 
 We have sent out an invitation to neighborhood groups, individuals, stakeholders, interested parties, and the commissioners for a community outreach meeting on Tuesday, February 10 at 6:00 p.m., at our offices, 1650 Mission Street.
 
 In that invitation, we solicited any written comments from the public on any specific proposals they may have and on the proposals we put forth.
 
 After that meeting, we will synthesize that information, revise our proposal, and hope to come back to you in mid March to tell you what happened at that outreach meeting and present you with more ideas on DR.

 Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals


 


Board of Supervisors reported by Tara Sullivan-Lenane of staff:
 




There were no sub-committee land use meetings. There has not been a formal Chair announced for the Land Use Committee and that meeting was canceled.


At Tuesday's full Board hearing there were two items related to planning.


The first was a piece of legislation that would change the Planning Code to require a conditional use (CU) to remove any dwelling unit.
 
 Right now the code says that any removal up to one or two units is a discretionary review and anything above that requires conditional use.
 
 This was introduced by former Supervisor McGoldrick.
 
 This Commission recommended disapproval at the October 23
rd
 hearing.
 
 It did go to the full Board and the full Board did recommend approval of it.
 
 The Mayor did veto this piece of legislation and it was back at the full Board last Tuesday.
 
 The veto over ride did fail on a +7 -4 vote.
 
 The current code is still in existence – the McGoldrick legislation failed.
 


The second item before the full Board was an appeal at 299 Valencia Street.
 
 It was a CU appeal that this Commission passed on November 6.
 
 There were two CU requests at that hearing for this project.
 
 One was to allow development on a large lot over 10,000 square feet and the other was for parking spaces.
 
 The project is in an NC-2 zoning district and the zoning permits up to .5 parking spaces per dwelling unit. And anything .75 and above requires a CU.
 
 You had granted 25 residential spaces.
 
 The CU on the parking spaces only was at the full Board.
 
 The Board failed to get the 2/3 necessary votes to overturn you.
 
 They tabled the item, which allows the project to move forward as you approved it.


There was no new legislation introduced this past week and Land Use is canceled next week.




 


Board of Appeals as reported by ZA Badiner:
 


Commissioner Olague




I spoke with some neighborhood activist on the 299 Valencia issue.
 
 My sense was that the concern had to do in part with the CU process.
 
 There is a desire for us to establish more specific criteria when we apply CU in the Market and Octavia area as it relates to parking.
 
 They felt that needed to be strengthened.
 
 I don't know what that means.
 
 I forget at this point what was adopted ultimately in the Market and Octavia Plan as far as criteria is concerned for CU permits as it relates to parking.
 
 My sense in my conversations with the people is that they want to see the CAC with the Board (of Supervisors) and the Department, at some point, discuss what that means.




ZA Badiner responded




I believe there are nine specific criteria.
 
 The way that we reviewed it is that the criteria we recommended to the Commission and the Commission said it met the criteria and it
 
 was adopted.
 
 What I have heard was that there was a focus on the overall CU, for any CU of whether something is necessary and desirable.
 
 And I heard there was a desire that there be more discussion of the necessary and desirable of the parking itself than was done in these findings.
 
 I think that was one of the arguments that was made.




Tara Sullivan-Lenane




There were two discussions.
 
 It was about the overall number of parking spaces.
 
 But it did focus on that discussion.
 
 The Zoning Administrator is correct, 151.1(f) has nine criteria that the Planning Department must find and on this particular project at 299 Valencia five of the nine findings didn't apply to the project because of its modest size and limited commercial use.
 
 There were four findings that did apply to this project; the Department made that case and the Commission found that those four criteria did apply.
 
 There was a large discussion about the overall policy issue in terms of the review of these criteria under the new plan...
 
 It was interesting because there were comments because the plan was recently passed and it went through a lot of negotiations at the Board level.
 
 So there was a lot of larger policy discussion as well.
 
 But ultimately it did focus on the additional parking spaces that were permitted via a CU to get to the .75.
 
 But the criterion was met.




Commissioner Antonini




Procedural question on  tabling:  what happens when something is tabled?




Tara Sullivan-Lenane




This was never really in Committee.
 
 I will defer to the City Attorney, but ultimately a CU can only be overturned by the Board by a 2/3 vote.
 
 There was a vote of +7 -4.
 
 They could not get that additional vote to get the 2/3 vote.
 
 So there was a unanimous +11 -0 vote to table the item altogether.
 
 Essentially tabling isn't a withdrawal.
 
 It's just filing it and won't get taken up.
 
 I actually will defer to the  City Attorney for the specifics. 
 
But it did get tabled. Which means the project can move forward because the CU was not acted upon and is still valid.




Deputy City Attorney Susan Cleveland-Knowles




is correct in this case that a tabling effectively means that the appeal is denied.
 
 But there are other cases at Committee where an item could be tabled and brought back at a later date.
 
 But in this instance the appeal is effectively denied.

SPEAKERS:


Jason Henderson




Re:
 
 299 Valencia CU appeal – The Hayes Valley Neighborhood Association is disappointed in what has transpired and feels this is a dead give away of conditional uses.


Something needs to be worked out between the use, which we support, and the feature (excess parking), which we do not support.




Robin Levitt




Thanked the commissioners for their service and congratulated the new officers of the Commission


Re:
 
 299 Valencia -- this CU give away on parking undermines the Market and Octavia plan.
 
 We have to come up with some sort of criteria for future projects that come before you for CU for additional parking.




Ernestine Weiss




Congratulated Ron Miguel on being elected President and thanked Christina Olague for all her input.


Please get on with the Ferry Park renovation.
 
 It's been going on since October 2007.




Peter Cohen




Re:
 
 299 Valencia – It was a loss that the CAC was not in place and if they had been this project would not have caught the community off guard.


This project sits on two boundaries – Market and Octavia and the Mission.
 
 When that happens, the project impacts should be looked at in the context of both plan areas.




Sue Hestor




I want to support Peter, Jason and Robin.


I think there is an unfortunate bifurcation in the Planning Department between environmental review and project review.
 
 I don't think anyone looks at the cumulative traffic congestion, because parking equals cars and cars travel on streets.
 
 I don't think anyone reads the environmental documents.




Commissioners Borden, Moore, Olague, Antonini, Sugaya, and Lee
 
requested and/or supports a scheduled meeting with representatives of residential building construction, bank financing, and parking.
 
 They want to get some understanding of how bank financing impacts what residential or mixed use developers are asking the Commission for (how they affect each other), which should open the door on a more honest dialog on parking that includes a discussion of MUNI, congestion pricing, and an analysis of traffic – how much is from residential in the area and how much is passing through?
 
 They would also like staff to keep them informed of when the CAC finally starts meeting and how that is proceeding.


Commissioner Lee




Suggested that the Commission invite 
Von
 
Bond
 Yee who runs the Department of Parking and Traffic for the city to provide an overview of where they are because he thinks the commission needs a baseline when they talk about parking and cars.




Director Rahaim




The Department is organizing a briefing on transportation.
 
 It will probable take us a couple of months.
 
 We are proposing to have MUNI, Department of Public Works, and the Transportation Authority here to talk about a variety of transportation issues.
 
 We will schedule a special meeting for that in late March or early April.




Commissioner Olague




That would include MEA right?
 
 Because I would really like to understand how they arrive at some of their conclusions when it comes to their analysis of transportation and parking.

(-) Jerry Adams, elected member of the Residence Council of the San Francisco Towers,
 
a retirement complex of some 300 people on Van Ness, around the corner from this proposed location


– The Council wishes to remind the Commission that it was the Department that rezoned Van Ness Avenue to a residential use and also provided for ground floor retail.
 
 The Council is of the opinion that the move of this retail business selling pornography any closer to Van Ness Avenue would have a negative affect on that zoning as well as to a neighborhood that is increasingly characterized as one of frail, handicapped, and elderly people.


(+) Chris Schulman – Office of Economic Development, Polk Corridor Manager




Frontlyne Inc. has been a very good neighbor for 20 plus years and has strong ties to the neighborhood.
 
 If you walk down Polk Street, most people do not know that it is an adult video store.

(-) [Name unclear]




We oppose any reduction and/or shadowing of downtown open space.

Please reconsider your decision to grant a 46 percent height bonus as a reward for a LEED certified building.




(-) Bill Sauro, President, Barbary Coast Neighborhood Association




Go green and get spot rezoning.
 
 That is a terrible precedent you will establish with this project.




(-) Diana Taylor




Our neighborhood association has strong opposition to any increase in height along the waterfront and we do support a full EIR.




(-) Katie Hopkins




I'm here to support the staff's original recommendation from November 30, 2008 to disapprove the rezoning of this site because the height increase is in conflict with the current zoning; the proposed design is inappropriate with surrounding buildings; and the new building will cast new shadows on open space.




(-) Kathleen Dooly




It is a dangerous precedent to allow any development along the Embarcadero to have an exemption to the height limit.
 
 Developers will be happy to develop their projects as green to get that bonus.
 
 We'll end up with Miami Beach down there.




(+) Ernestine Weiss




I live in the area and I'm here to support the project.

Follow the Department's original recommendation and disapprove the rezoning of this single site to accommodate this project.




(-) Andy Katz




I am in strong opposition of the rezoning of 110 The Embarcadero from 84 feet to 130 feet.
 
 Spot zoning sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the very purpose of the city's Waterfront and General Plans.
 
 Please require a full EIR




(-) Paul Wermer




I'm here to speak against the spot rezoning.
 
 The Waterfront Plan might be an old document, but it can be reviewed with broad public input and updated if need be.
 
 That has not been done.




(-) Dave Osgood, Rincon Center Tenants Association




We oppose this high rise.
 
 It is out of place in this special and important area in this city.
 
 It is out of scale with the Audiffred building.




(-) Catherine Haydn, resident of Rincon Towers




The current vacant building is an eyesore and something needs to be done and it's nice that a developer is doing something with the space and its wonderful that the parking has been removed.
 
 Why does the building have to be so large and why are we going against the city guidelines and policy?




(-) Joe Butler




I urge you not to reclassify 110 The Embarcadero for new bulk and height.




(-) Zach Stewart




We are unique and we should not let developers go against our General Plan




(-)Jan Wood




I oppose this exception to the General Plan and the Waterfront Plan.
 
 It's a bad idea to grant this spot zoning.




(-) Jennifer Clary – SF Tomorrow




Offered to take the commission on a tour of the waterfront.


Do not pit the environment against the neighborhood.
 
 That is what you would be doing with this project.
 
 If you give people a density bonus for LEED buildings, you're going to have a fight between greening the city and over building the city.




(-) P. K. Cannon




This is a project of spot zoning and spot zoning is generally not a good idea.




(-) Gerry Crowley




We ask that you reconsider your decision and require that a full EIR be done for this project.




(-) Brad Paul




An 84 foot tall building with mechanicals is tall enough.
 
 I urge you to disapprove this reclassification.
 
 This would be a terrible precedent and why?
 
 What decisions have they made to make this building so expensive?




(-) Sue Hestor




The rational for the height is the building.
 
 That is a rational for spot zoning.
 
 It should be what is the context for the heights in the Downtown Plan?




(+) Michael Burk – representing the Project Sponsor




As far as shadow and wind impacts being significant, based on shadow and wind studies in the Mitigated Neg. Dec, they are found not to be significant.
 
 As far as inadequate public review, there was public notice of the availability of the Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration and of the underlying studies and anyone who had an interest could review them.
 
 This is not spot zoning.
 
 This is a single site rezoning.
 
 We already have a LEED-Platinum certification and it's in the materials sent to you.
 
 We do comply with the Downtown Plan policies.

(-) Lisa Wong – DR requestor




My house is north and down hill from the project sponsor.
 
 The addition will block my southern light for most of the day.
 
 I would not be here if the project sponsor had been cooperative and made compromises.
 
 None of us received notification of the original project.
 
 If we had, we would have asked them to lower and shorten their project.
 
 Even without neighbor review/approval, they built their project looking nothing like the city approved drawings.
 
 They raised the parapet on the sides, moved the stairs in the rear; and put a parapet in the rear.




 


ACTION:
 
 Took discretionary Review and approved the project with modifications to require the front parapet to rap around the sides for three (3) feet; lower the remaining sides and rear parapets to six (6) inches; one hour fire rated roof; and require light reflective or white paint in light wells and on rear wall

San Andreas Pipeline No.3 Installation Project
 
- 
Public Hearing in the Draft Environmental Impact Report
. The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) is sponsoring a proposed project that requires the installation of approximately 23,400 feet (4.4 miles) of new pipeline to extend the existing San Andreas Pipeline No. 3 (SAPL3) from the San Pedro Valve Lot (SPVL) in Daly City to Merced Manor Reservoir (MMR) in San Francisco. For approximately half its length, the pipeline would follow the alignment of the Baden Merced Pipeline, which has been taken out of service because of its deteriorated condition. For the other sections of the pipeline, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) has chosen alternative routes to minimize environmental impacts. Where the proposed SAPL 3 alignment differs from the existing BMPL alignment, the BMPL would either be filled with a concrete slurry mixture or would be capped. The alignment follows city streets, except in two locations (the San Francisco Golf Club and the Lake Merced Golf Club). The Project would be constructed using the open-trench method ( cut and cover ) for most of the pipeline and a trenchless ( jack and bore ) method at high-traffic intersections (at John Daly Boulevard and Sheffield Drive in Daly City, at 19th Avenue and Crespi/Holloway Avenue in San Francisco, and at 19th Avenue and Eucalyptus Drive in San Francisco). In addition to the pipeline main, the Project also includes the installation of crossover pipelines, five customer service connections, various underground vaults, appurtenances, and a cathodic projection system.
 
 
Key features of the proposed Project include:




Requires the installation of 4.4 miles of new pipeline;


Entails open trench construction for most of the alignment, but will use  Jack and bore' construction at three busy intersections; and


The alignment will pass through the Lake Merced Golf Course and the San Francisco Golf Course.




Written comments on the DEIR will be accepted at the Planning Department's office until the close of business on January 28, 2009.


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 No Action Required.
