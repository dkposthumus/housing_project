 Also, I visited the Inverness site that is before us today, but I did not meet with project sponsor or DR requestor.
 
 Third, I wanted to compliment the Director on the article in the Chronicle and his choices, which I pretty much agree with.


Commissioner Miguel:


I think that was an excellent article.
 
 I was very pleased with it.
 
 I'd like to thank Steve Moss, the publisher of the

 Director's Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


There is a memo in your packet from planner Dan Sider regarding the details on properties in the expiring Redevelopment Area.
 
 On the second page of that memo there are specifics on projects that are kind of half way through in the approval process.
 
 Secondly, as part of the annual American Planning Association conference this year I will be participating in an all day session that is titled  The Quest for Green Communities. 
 
 I will be on with three other people doing an all day session about how cities across the country are incorporating climate change strategies into their planning and redevelopment policies and practices.
 
 Related to that, I would like to reiterate that we are able to provide in the budget this fiscal year for the Commissioners to join APA.
 
 If you are interested, please let Linda know and we can make those arrangements.
 
 I have asked Tara Sullivan to come today to talk to you about our proposed process for how we are going to address the re-write of Articles 10 & 11.

 Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.


 


BOARD OF SUPERVISORS REVIEW:


 
 None


 


BOARD OF APPEALS REVIEW;


 
Last night President Fung announced that Mattie Jackson, a previous commissioner who served with President Fung on the Board 25 years ago, recently passed away.
 
 President Fung noted that she was perhaps the longest serving member on the Board of Appeals as she served under four separate Mayoral administrations.
 
 The Board of Appeals also held discussion on their budget and voted +5 -0 to adopt their budget.
 
 The Board also had two projects before them that might be of note to this commission: 
1450 Franklin Street
, which is a project that had been approved under the Redevelopment Agency authority.
 
 It is a 130 foot-tall building, 69 dwelling units of which 9 are to be affordable.
 
 San Francisco Heritage appealed because of concerns about the EIR and treatment about the historic building that is currently on the property.
 
 The current zoning would only allow a maximum of 20 dwelling units.
 
 Commissioner Garcia proposed to amend the proposal by requiring one affordable unite, which would bring it under compliance with the Planning Code.
 
 This proposal would require four votes to pass.
 
 They failed to get the four votes. 
 
On Delores Street there was a recent review that the Planning Commission had on December 4, 2008 for a dwelling unit merger from three units to two units.
 
 The Planning Department recommended disapproval of the project and the Planning Commission upheld the disapproval by a vote of +5 -2.
 
 Last night the Board of Appeals overturned the Planning Commission decision.
 
 We found that it only met two of the five criteria.
 
 The Board felt that it was not affordable and that it would create family housing.


 


HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION REVIEW:


The Historic Preservation Commission meets on the first and third Wednesday of each month.
 
 They elected interim officers:
 
 Charles Chase is the interim President and Courtney Damkroger is the interim Vice President.
 
 At the moment they are comprised of only four members:
 
 Charles Chase, Courtney Damkroger, Karl Hasz, and Alan Martinez.
 
 All but Charles were former members of the Landmarks Board.
 
 Last night Tara Sullivan of Department staff gave a report on the proposed changes to Articles 10 & 11.
 
 Staff will ask Supervisor Daily for an extension of time to complete drafting proposed changes and allow for public participation.
 
 There is a proposal for two joint hearings with the Planning Commission and HPC, the first of which is proposed for April 2
nd
.
 
 The goal is to have review and proposed changes to the Board of Supervisors by early June.
 
 The Commission has an informational presentation on the Department budget that will be before you shortly.
 
 2151 Van Ness Avenue – St. Bridget's Church was on calendar for a Certificate of Appropriateness.
 
 Commissioner Martinez was concerned and requested that the proposed new lift be approved by DBI.
 
 He also encouraged the Project Sponsor to use the State Historic Building Code.
 
 The C of A was approved unanimously.
 
 The last item on their calendar, the public review of Piers 15 & 17 on the Embarcadero – The Exploratorium Relocation draft EIR.
 
 The public expressed concerns about the new bridge building.
 
 Commissioner Martinez did not feel that the proposed glass and steel materials are compatible with the existing historic structures.
 
 Commissioner Hasz did feel that the transparent quality of the glass was suitable but had concerns about the steel.
 
 Ultimately the commission voted to have a letter sent to the Department's ERO, Bill Wycko, expressing their concerns.
 


 


INFORMATIONAL UPDATE ON ARTICLES 10 & 11:


There have been several internal meetings to discuss how to move forward the re-writes of Articles 10 & 11.
 
 There is legislation that has been proposed by the Board of Supervisors; there is a separate piece of legislation that has been proposed by the Mayor's Office; and the Department has decided that we are going to have a separate third piece of legislation for Articles 10 & 11 taking some of the best practices from other jurisdictions as well as some of the ideas that are currently in some of the proposed legislation.
 
 We did take the Historic Preservation Commission suggestion and decided to break up the review of this into five large subject areas:
 
 (1) The Purposes of Articles 10 & 11, the Powers and Duties of the Historic Preservation Commission, and the Role of the Planning Department and Staff; (2) Designations under Articles 10 & 11 – Individual landmarks, historic districts, and the reclassification of Article 11 buildings in conservation districts; (3) Permits - Certificates of Appropriateness, Permits to Alter, what kind of work can be approved at staff level, processes, notifications, etc; (4) survey work, enforcement, preservation incentives, appeals, etc; and (5) is not really a topic, but a catch-all.
 
 We have formed a working group to meet bi-weekly on each of these topics.
 
 We also want to have two joint hearings so that the public can come and comment on the progress that we're making and on the other pieces of legislation.
 
 They are tentatively scheduled for the 2
nd
 of April and the 7
th
 of May.
 
 Then we are going to take the rest of May and wrap up the legislation and ideally have the action hearing on June 3
rd
 for the Historic Preservation Commission for their recommendations, and on June 4
th
 here at the Planning Commission for your recommendations before it goes back to the Board.
 
 Key to that is obtaining an extension on the Board of Supervisor's legislation.
 
 That deadline is April 14.
 
 Both Commissions have expressed concerned and would like all the legislations reviewed and analyzed all at once. 
 
Hopefully we can get the extension from the Board.
 
 If not, we will re-adjust our timeframes and I'll be back.

Re:
 
 case 2008.0081E for the reconstruction and rebuilding of 950 Mason Hill project – which is the knock down of the Fairmont Hotel and rebuilding of the Fairmont Hotel.
 
 I am totally opposed to this project.
 
 This project is totally un-needed in this day and age.

Re:
 
 DR Reform process - [Submitted a letter from the Neighborhood Network].
 
 We all agree that reducing the number of DRs that come before the Commission is critical.
 
 We firmly believe that the reform process needs to review the entire process from the start of the pre-application all the way through rather than just focus on the DR hearing.
 
 We are asking that the Commission clarify the scope and clarify to include the full process from the pre-application all the way to the end.


 


Adjournment
