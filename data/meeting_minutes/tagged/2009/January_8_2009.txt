Commission Comments/Questions






Inquiries/Announcements
.
 
 Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).


Future Meetings/Agendas
.
 
 At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.




 


Commissioner Antonini:


 
 -
 
 He mentioned an article in the Chronicle on the concept of fees for cars entering various parts of the city.
 
 I believe we have this scheduled for future discussion because I think it is important that we listen to comments from the public and have an ability to weigh in.


Commissioner Miguel:




He mentioned a December 19
th
 article in the Business Times on 1314 Polk Street that is a 100% affordable project that in the re-sale of units the concept of low income and over/under 55 problems have occurred.
 
 This is a disturbing thing.
 
 We make the presumption that our decisions are in perpetuity, or at least for the time limit that the code allows.
 
 If we could get an idea from the Department of how prevalent this problem is; of how it may have been resolved in the past; of what is happening presently; and if there is any action that we (the Commission) might take to encourage this going forward in a more judicial manner.




 


Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:




I would be happy to.
 
 We take this very seriously and this is an item we are pursuing at the same time trying to figure out a way not to damage what are the innocent buyers of this property.
 
 My sense is that this is not prevalent; that this is an isolated case.
 
 But I will get back to you on that and talk to more about our enforcement processes.
 
 We definitely have to balance the fairness with the existing owners, the city, the seniors, and the public interest.
 
 It is a difficult issue.




Commissioner Miguel:




It would be interesting to me on this issue to understand what the obligations are and what instructions are given to Realtors of how this recorded and how obvious this is to anyone who actually reads through that paper work, so we can understand why they can just go by the (not clear).




As the Zoning Administrator Badiner was responding,
 
Commission Secretary Avery reminded him that this item is not on the agenda and could therefore not be discussed.


Commissioner Olague
 
requested that the item be placed on calendar next week.


Zoning Administrator Badiner
 
requested that this be put on calendar towards the end of the month (1/22/09) to continue with discussions with the City Attorney and other involved parties.


Commissioner Olague agreed.




That's good.
 
 This seems to be on going.


Senior housing in general is a topic that I would be interested in hearing more about, but something like this, I think we really need to look at.




Commissioner Lee:




Following up on this item – I know one of the tenants there, they used to be a DA investigator, and they brought it to my attention.
 
 I referred them to the Board of Appeals and to you Larry (the Zoning Administrator).
 
 I guess the question is under bankruptcy what rights does someone have as a developer or a unit senior housing owner using Title 7 or 8 vs 11?
 
 Can the City Attorney's office under Director's Report give us some guidance so we can understand it?
 
 Because we do know that we had the case on 24th Street where the developer could not sell senior housing and came to us and we denied it.
 
 There has got to be a fairness principal.


Can we get some legal understanding and Planning Code understanding that if you get a special (low income, senior, etc.) unit, what is the criteria?
 
 This should just be informational.


The President of the Commission has asked for joint hearings.
 
 As part of our calendar we should start scheduling them way ahead of time to get the agreement of the other department and let the public know.
 
 With that, given the economic climate I'd like to have a joint hearing with the Small Business Commission to see if there are things we are doing or are not doing that we should be doing to streamline the process.
 




Commissioner Sugaya:




Since the election and the passage of J and the institution of the new Historic Preservation Commission the Mayor's Office has had 31 or 61 days (I forget) to submit names for the commissioners in seven seats that make up the Historic Preservation Commission.
 
 The Mayor did so on the last legal day, submitted seven names to the Board of supervisors.
 
 The Board of Supervisors is charged with approving those nominations.
 
 Of the seven that the Mayor nominated, four withdrew.
 
 He nominated another person.
 
 That person withdrew.
 
 The track record of the Mayor's nominations is of eight nominations, five have withdrawn.
 
 The Rules Committee of the Board of Supervisors have gone on to recommend and the full Board did approve seating four commissions.
 
 Alan Martinez in seat one of the architect; Charles Chase who is the former Director of the San Francisco Architectural Heritage who is a architect that the Mayor nominated into an architectural historian seat, which to me makes absolutely no sense at all.
 
 Mr. Chase as well said that he had talked to the Mayor's Office about his qualifications.
 
 Courtney Damkroger who is a preservation planner and was also on the former Landmarks Board is seated in seat 5 I believe and Karl Hasz, who is a contractor, and who also was on the Landmarks Board was seated.
 
 The other architect seat number two, the Mayor's candidate was put on hold at this point and there are two vacant seats at the moment.
 
 I don't know if they are going to go ahead and meet because they do have a quorum at this point.




Director Rahaim responded
:


-
 
 Yes they do plan to meet the first time on January 21

 DIRECTOR'S REPORT


 




Director's Announcements




Director Rahaim
:




Happy New Year to all of you and I'm happy to tell you that as of last Friday I survived one year in my position.
 
 It's been a challenging but great year in many ways.


I will also tell you that this is also another important date because it is Zoning Administrator Badiner's birthday today.
 
 I won't give away what year it is & 




Zoning Administrator Badiner:




I am now eligible to be nominated as a historic resource


I did not say I was qualified, I said I was eligible.




Director Rahaim:




The budget is on our minds these days.
 
 We are keeping a close watch on fee revenues which makes up nearly 90% of our revenues for our budget.


The recent downsizing that we did was based on the first quarter revenues, which was July through September.
 
 We are just getting the numbers in for the second quarter.


The preliminary analysis suggests that they are no better.


We are hoping that they are no worse but we are looking at those now and looking at ways we can be creative.


We will report to you in more detail when we have more information on those numbers.


On congestion pricing briefing suggested by Commissioner Antonini – our plan is to combine that with a larger transportation planning briefing, and similar to what we did on the sustainability briefing, we were going to invite several departments to tell us their role in transportation planning.


As Commissioner Sugaya mentioned, four members of the Historic Preservation Commission have been confirmed, which is a quorum, and they have chosen to meet for the first time on January 21
st
.

 Re:
 
 Area Plans have not been forth coming in the past 10 years as they have been in the past few years.
 
 Neighborhood volunteers do not have the staff and or time to fight the fires on all fronts.
 
 Why do things have to go so fast?
 
 In most cases, although Area Plans may have been available for quite some time, environmental documents have not.
 
 Please allow volunteers time to focus on these things that are coming down.
