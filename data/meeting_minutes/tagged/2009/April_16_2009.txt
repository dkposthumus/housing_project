Commissioner Lee:


 
 He reported that last Sunday's paper carried an article that at the request of Supervisor Dufty WEBCORE helped a family with special needs in San Francisco.
 
 WEBCORE added another bedroom to the family's house for a special needs child.
 
 He wanted to acknowledge both the supervisor and WEBCORE for their actions.
 
 He also reported that he heard that the owner of Stonestown had filed bankruptcy.
 
 He is concerned because that real estate tax will be tied up in bankruptcy court.
 
 A report from Ken Rosen predicted that San Francisco will have another 20 or 30 thousand unemployed by next year.
 
 He would like to get a report in the next couple of weeks under Director's Report regarding Mission Bay and UCSF and some of their expansion, their hospital, etc. 
 
Is there anything we need to do as a commission, as a department, to make sure we are not holding up any development in the city?
 
 I'm specifically looking at PUC and their projects and UCSF.


Zoning Administrator Badiner:


 
 On the WEBCORE project that supervisor Dufty was so instrumental in moving ahead, we worked closely with them because there were certain approvals that needed to be granted such as a variance for building in the rear yard and we held some special hearings to move it forward.
 
 It was a worthy project and it took a lot of coordination between Planning, DBI and other agencies to move it ahead.
 
 It was very successful.


Commissioner Antonini:


 
 Last week my wife and I were in Georgia, in three cities, and I had some questions based on our observations that I don't expect answers for today.
 
 The first is for Savannah.
 
 It has one of the largest historic districts in the United States.
 
 I noticed that as they were adding to historic buildings, much of the format they used was similar to the building that was already there.
 
 I'm wondering what the Secretary of the Interior, according to what we've been hearing on historical additions are, that they have to look different from what they are adding to.
 
 Maybe we can get some information on that because everything they did there was in context with the existing building.
 
 Two, they have an interesting situation. 
 
They have an institution called SCAD, Savannah College of Art and Design.
 
 They have 15,000 students that pay around $20,000 apiece.
 
 They have vehicles that take them around Savannah and they have their own police force with vehicles.
 
 Everyone seems to like this.
 
 One reason is that as part of their entitlement process they have to renovate buildings or contribute to the renovation of historic buildings and they have done a lot of it including a theatre and an old train station.
 
 It might be well to get some information, find out what kind of arrangement was struck between them and the city. 
 
It might be instructive in the future for some of our needs here.
 
 In Augusta, beautiful golf course, unlike many private golf courses, it looks on to itself and as you drive from the outside you don't see anything.
 
 We have some beautiful public golf courses in San Francisco that are accessible to the public, one of which is Lincoln Park which was designed by Allister McKenisy who also designed Augusta National about 12 years before that.
 
 The question is is it possible to landmark a golf course?
 
 It seems that if something is a public asset it should be considered because of its historic nature, and the fact that it is symbiotic with the general public and provides recreation for golfers and those who visit it.
 
 And finally we were in Atlanta.
 
 They have a nice system called MARTA that is very similar to BART with the exception that their system serves the city more than just serving the suburbs.
 
 MARTA goes to all parts of the city of Atlanta which has less population than San Francisco but more land area.
 
 I'm sure our transportation people are checking on transportation systems throughout the country, but I thought that they did a very good job on that particular system.
 
 It is all in its own right-of-way and most of it is subway.


Commissioner Sugaya:


 
 I went to the Housing Element meeting last night held in the tenderloin.
 
 One of the problems voiced by some people is that if you are fortunate enough to be in an SRO, you've been there for a while but now have the means to move on to something like a studio, it is very difficult to do that.
 
 One man said you actually have to become homeless again to qualify to get into a different kind of housing. 
 
Some of it was aimed at some of the problems that exist with the process.
 
 Also, along with Commissioner Miguel, I attended a workshop for the Japantown Better Neighborhood Plan that's going on.
 
 There will be a major community workshop on the 25
th
 in Japantown.
 


Commissioner Moore:


 
 Following up on Commissioner Antonini's comments about Savannah, the city doesn't just have a few historic buildings here and there, the entire town is dominated by a cohesive fabric of historic buildings, which are further kind of brought along by a form based code that allows a completely differently way of reshaping the future city of what additions are as Commissioner Antonini referred to.
 
 I also want to comment on their Art Institute which is very closely working with downtown merchants and vacant store fronts etc.
 
 They have a working hand-in-glove cooperation.
 
 It is very above board, very legal, and very strongly supported by the city because it actually brings in students and everything works together – housing, commerce, etc.
 
 I also want to make a comment triggered by Commissioner Sugaya.
 
 Lately I've been walking in the tenderloin and have been surprised that some of the new below market rate buildings, one in particular at the corner of Hyde and Eddy, have been vacant for quite some time.
 
 Only on the upper floors, in two units, have I seen people living, but the rest is empty.
 
 I don't understand.
 
 I want to ask someone, perhaps Sara when she presents the Housing Element, how are we bringing people to live in these buildings?
 
 This building has been completed at least six to eight months ago and it is still empty.
 
 That concerns me as we sit here and talk about the lack of housing and yet that is there and still vacant.


Commissioner Miguel:


 
 Regarding the meetings in Japantown, they have been very interesting.
 
 The meeting on the 25
th
 is a large public meeting that will have MUNI there regarding Geary BRT and how they are currently planning to handle that Fillmore Street intersection.
 
 I was at the Housing Element presentation in the Richmond that went quite well, and during the past week I've been in meetings with Supervisor Mar, Tony Kelly of the Potrero Boosters, and both sides of the Market/Buchannan issue that is before us today.


Commissioner Olague:


 
 She suggested to Commissioner Moore that she get the address and find out who manages the property (in the tenderloin) and call them, have a conversation with them.
 
 I'm sure they would have some insight. Maybe someone in the Department or the Mayor's Office of Housing can give you a contact.
 
 She was unable to addend the meetings on the Market/Buchanan project.
 
 She did attend a meeting in the Mission on the beginning discussions of raising heights on Mission Street.
 
 What role would the CAC play in those discussions when they are formed?
 


Commissioner Borden:


 
 She participated in a panel discussion last night about education in San Francisco and it brought to my attention that every week and all the issues we talk about, the land use connections, we don't talk enough about education and the important role of how all of that stuff is interconnected.
 
 The city, how its value as a city, why people want to be here, and its growth and development, that our educational system and whether or not we are able to educate our kids, provide quality public schools, whether we are able to attract a great work force are really predicated on a lot of the decisions we make here every single week.
 
 And that brings me back to the conversation we've had about hosting a hearing on families in this city.
 
 We talk about family housing or creating opportunities for families, and education is kind of the critical component.
 
 Families choose to live in San Francisco if they feel their kid can go to a great school and if they don't feel that way they often don't stay.
 
 That is often a piece of the puzzle we don't discuss, but it's really critical.
 
 There is that issue of neighborhood schools.
 
 But it brings up neighborhoods and why people chose to live in neighborhoods and the relationship of a school to a neighborhood and how people chose to gather around that institution.
 
 It would be great if we could get that back on the agenda and have that discussion.
 
 I think it is too important a topic for us to miss out on. 
 
The panel also talked about the new program - SF Promise. San Francisco State University is the first CSU to offer any kid from 6
th
 grade onward that attends a San Francisco high school and performs at a certain level a guaranteed opportunity to go to college.
 
 I thought that was a really innovative program. 
 
She also mentioned the upcoming foreclosures in commercial real estate and how they have changed hands in the last five years; and how the expensive properties are now not getting the expensive rents.
 
 That is going to be a huge crisis that we haven't begun to fathom.
 
 Some of these assets help fund a lot of public services in the city and it's going to be a real problem as we try to balance this budget.
 
 Finally, I thought it was exciting that President Obama today is really stepping up his efforts on supporting high speed rail and an interconnective rail system throughout the country.
 
 California has already made our commitment to high speed rail and I think whatever we can do to support that project from where we are sitting and help other cities understand the importance would be a great thing.


Commissioner Antonini:


 
 Noted that he met with the project sponsor of the Drew School project; the project sponsor of the 1960 Market project as well as a number of neighborhood groups who have some concerns.


Commissioner Lee:


 
 Supports Commissioner Borden's request to have a hearing or get input from the School Board regarding family housing.
 
 Are we doing enough or not enough?
 
 I don't have a sense of it.
 
 I know quite a few of our students in the city go to private schools.
 
 A lot of younger parents move out of the city because they believe schools are better elsewhere.
 
 One of the areas we need to do better in San Francisco is in math and science.

 Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.


 


AnMarie Rodgers reported on Board of Supervisors activities:


 
 At the Land Use Committee:




Info hearing on 1250 Missouri Street development.
 
 The project was permitted as a commercial/light industry use in 2001.
 
 Complaints were filed in 2008 that the scope of permit had been exceeded by converting the units into residential use.
 
 The Board asked for a status update at Monday's hearing in which Planning and DBI provided info regarding their review process and what further steps will be necessary to complete the project within the approved scope of work.
 
 A representative of the project sponsor was present and reaffirmed their willingness to work with both Departments to resolve the outstanding violations and complete their obligations to return this property to commercial use.


Home Improvement District – resolution introduced last fall by Supervisors Maxwell, Ammiano & Dufty urging city agencies to consider the a home improvement district along Bayshore Blvd.
 
 They requested that this district have a green and sustainable overlay and character, spurred in part by the potential future arrival of Lowe's and potential impacts on existing businesses and on the character of the area.
 
 I response, the Mayor's Office, Planning Department, Department of the Environment and Redevelopment Agency have committed to develop an economic development strategy for this area.




At the Full Board:




Visitacion Valley/Schlage Lock Redevelopment Plan was before the full Board this week.
 
 Minor technical amendments were made.
 
 Adoption is expected to be considered next week.


India
 
Basin Industrial Park
 
– This rezoning was sponsored by Supervisor Maxwell and approved by the Planning Commission on February 5
th
.
 
 Last week the Land Use Committee modified it to the setback requirement in the text amendment.
 
 With that amendment, the Full Board passed the Text and Map amendments on first reading.


Inclusionary in Lieu Fees for Small Site Acquisition and Rehabilitation – this ordinance would amend PC Sec 315.6, controls for inclusionary housing to provide that 10% of in lieu fees paid ((not to exceed a maximum of $15 mission at any one time,)) to be designated exclusively for the acquisition or rehab of affordable housing sites consisting of less than 25 units.
 
 On 2/26, this commission voted to recommend several modifications to add flexibility.
 
 At the Land Use Committee, they increased the flexibility to the ordinance.
 
 With these amendments to increase flexibility, the Full Board passed the item on final reading.


Zoning Map Amendment 401-421 Shields Street – this property was mistakenly zoned  public  in the 1978 when a group of nearby parcels were acquired for the creation of Brooks Park.
 
 This property had remained in private ownership and this ordinance would rezone the property back to RH-1, which is consistent with the neighboring privately owned parcels.
 
 On 11/20/08, the Planning Commission recommended approval of this rezoning.
 
 This week the Board passed the item on final reading




Introductions:




Supervisor Mirkarimi signed on as a sponsor for the Department-initiated  Residential Care SUD  at 1500 Page Street.
 
 This ordinance is associated with a 38 room, 52 bed residential care project sponsored by the Mayor's Office of Housing.
 




 


Zoning Administrator Badiner reported on Board of Appeals activities:




1140 Potrero Ave
 
– a DR item heard by this commission on 2/28/08.
 
 The Commission took DR and approved the project but set the third floor back approximately 12 feet.
 
 Your vote was 4 to 2, with Commissioners Moore and Olague dissenting.
 
 The appeal to the Board of Appeals was filed on concerns about excavation.
 
 However, what was expressed at the hearing were privacy concerns related to the deck on the third floor.
 
 With the modifications to require smaller windows and a solid door instead of a glass door, the Board of Appeals upheld your determination 4 to 1 with Commission Go dissenting.




Commission Secretary reported on Historic Preservation Commission:




There were two items on their calendar:
 
 a request for a Certificate of Appropriateness on a rear addition to City Landmark #29 at 1348 10
th
 Avenue.
 
 After Commissioner Martinez expressed concern about proposed material to be used on two windows in the rear, the item was approved 4 to 0.
 


The other item was an informational discussion on the revisions to Planning Code Articles 10 & 11.
