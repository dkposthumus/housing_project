COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS


 


8.
 
 Commission Comments/Questions




Inquiries/Announcements
.
 
 Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).


Future Meetings/Agendas
.
 
 At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.




 


Commissioner Antonini:


 
 As we look at the revenue generated from these new buildings (Rincon Hill):
 
 infrastructure fees, school fees, and transfer taxes; I think we all win by having more buildings move forward.
 
 I think we want to revisit this and perhaps have the nexus study and see if the fees that were called for at that time are still appropriate in today's economic climate.
 
 It would seem to me that the language that the commission sent to the Board of Supervisors asks them to evaluate carefully any fees in view of the economic conditions that exist and weigh these additional fees against the fees that are already mandatory in the original legislation.
 
 To the extent possible, I would like to see that before we talk about entitlement extensions to see where we are and see what kind of revenues we have generated from the projects and see what effect these fees may have on other projects moving forward.
 


Commissioner Moore:


 
 On April 13, the Petaluma City Council voted to lay off the already reduced planning staff and by the summer, eliminate the position of the Planning Director as well.
 
 It is really sad because it is a small community that has done a lot of exemplary forward looking planning, from smart growth and form based code to a lot of things which are quite exemplary in a changing, high pressure environment.
 
 Just like we are, they are fee based and there is just not enough permit cost recovery to justify that they can continue to exist.
 
 I see that as a dangerous trend, particularly in a state as vital as California that is setting examples for forward looking planning and development.


Commissioner Borden:


 
 A house on Laidley Street in San Francisco won an AIA housing award on its eco-friendly design. It's nice that they are highlighting homes around the country that have taken in environmental features in their housing.


 


Commissioner Lee:


 
 Given the issue with One Rincon and their refusal to pay the mitigation fee that was agreed upon, I would like a list from the Mayor's Office of Housing of all the projects that have been built and have not paid their fees.


Commissioner Moore:


 
 The AIA Interiors Renovations won the first gold/platinum award, and I think that is also worth mentioning.


Commissioner Miguel:


 
 He attended the Glen Park Community Plan meeting this week that was run by the Department.
 
 It was well attended and it was nice to see that many of the people there had not been involved in that long delayed planning process prior to this time.
 
 He also attended a Potrero Merchants Association reception that had a lot of talk about planning in that area.
 
 On Monday, he attended the funeral of Redmond Kernan.
 
 He was at one time the Acting Director of the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency.
 
 He was an active Board member of SPUR and the Presidio Historical Society.
 
 I knew him for many years.
 
 He had a 14 year fight with cancer.
 
 He was an exemplary San Franciscan in my mind.
 
 The turn out at his funeral was a fine tribute to a man with a great sense of humor and a great love for San Francisco.
 
 We will adjourn today's meeting in his memory.


Commissioner Moore:


 
 Redmond Kernan was in front of this commission a few months ago when we discussed the museum.
 
 He was an elegant speaker, recalling the whole history of the plan and why this particular building was inappropriate for that site.
 
 I also want to add that on Tuesday I attended the Mid-Polk Neighborhood meeting where Planning presented the update on the Housing Element.

 DIRECTOR'S REPORT


 


9.
 
 Director's Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


 
 In your packets today is the 2008 Housing Inventory Report.
 
 Housing production last year was at the highest level since 1965.
 
 The actual number of units produced was 3,340.
 
 I will be out tomorrow through Tuesday at the annual Planning Convention which takes place this year in Minneapolis Minnesota. 
 
I will be participating in an all day session on Saturday about green communities with a number of other participants.
 
 Although the Commission does not meet next week, the AIA Convention will be in San Francisco from Wednesday through Sunday and I'll participate in two sessions.
 
 One will be at noon on Thursday regarding historic preservation issues around the waterfront.
 
 The second is on Friday morning regarding the future growth of the city, particularly downtown.
 
 The AIA has started a practice that in each host city every year they recognize the  ten greenest buildings. 
 
 There will be a press conference on Wednesday to announce the winners.


Zoning Administrator Badiner:


 
 I want to update you on or General Advertising Sign Program.
 
 Of the 1500 signs in the sign inventory, we have processed 55%.
 
 25% were illegal and have been removed.
 
 20% are pending removal.
 
 We have also been working with the Administrative Law Judge when we are challenged.
 
 We have had six Notices of Violation.
 
 Each one of the hearings is approximately a full day and a much more formal process that we have here at the Commission.
 
 Five of the six Notices of Violations have been upheld.
 
 We have been very successful.
 
 Last October the Commission considered  repeat violator  legislation - this is someone who puts up a sign, takes it down, puts it up again, and so on.
 
 You increased the fees for those violations.
 
 Last week we collected $15,000 from a single violator.
 
 I think our staff led by Dan Sider and Jon Purvis have been doing an excellent job.
