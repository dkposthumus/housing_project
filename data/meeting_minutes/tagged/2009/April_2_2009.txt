reliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions


 


SPEAKERS:
 


Project Sponsor




She described the project and her reason for wanting this project




 


 


(-)Leon Rampage




Neighborhood is inundated with restaurants and Laundromats.
 
 They block the sidewalks, sit on your stairs and leave all the mess.
 
 We've have enough.
 
 Any other type of business would be welcome, not another fast food restaurant




(-)Catherin Eandi




Everything is all bunched in.
 
 They take their take-out and sit on people's property and we have to clean it up.
 
 We don't feel there needs to be more.




(-)Monica Duffy




I own the property across the street with my husband and I'm tired of getting the phone calls about the mess across the street.
 
 I recommend you don't approve the project.




ACTION:
 
 Approved with modifications:
 
 Project sponsor to work to minimize disposable waste products; try to establish recycling practices; and include the standard condition of approval to police the area within 100 feet in the morning and the afternoon.

COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS

 Commission Comments/Questions




Inquiries/Announcements
.
 
 Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).


Future Meetings/Agendas
.
 
 At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.




 


Commissioner Antonini:


 
 He spoke on the congestion pricing concept.
 
 The problem is that we have to focus our congestion pricing on the areas where there is congestion.
 
 We already charge bridge tolls and parking fees in downtown San Francisco.
 
 80% of the people that work downtown in the financial district do not drive cars, they come by other means of transit.
 
 I think we are missing the point where we have freeways throughout the Bay Area that are free.
 
 There is no discouragement for people.
 
 That is where the congestion really exists.
 
 The heaviest corridors are the 580, the Livermore Valley and the Bay Bridge.
 
 It would be a major undertaking, but I think if you are going to think about these things, you have to address them on a regional basis and think about ways to discourage businesses from locating and sprawling their businesses out through the Bay Area, but to centralize them in areas where there is lots of transit.
 
 So at this time when our state is in dire need of revenue, this might be an idea that could be worth exploring.


Commissioner Moore:


 
 
I just want to briefly mention the housing forum. I attended yesterday. Several commissioners were present.
 
 It was an outstanding look at charting a new course for housing.
 
 It was a very thorough review, with different views on the state of the economy and how it affects California and San Francisco.
 
 Without getting into the details, it was a very worthwhile forum.


Commissioner Lee:


 
 I also attended the coalition seminar yesterday, which I found very enlightening with a lot of warnings regarding the commercial area. Actually, that's the next area that could have a major credit crunch.
 
 It concerns me, and actually I'm glad that I learned some of this stuff yesterday. I was trying to figure out what is the best way of taking that information from yesterday and distribute it to the general public.
 
 I really don't have any idea, but I think it was very educational.


Commissioner Borden:


 
 A question came up about how to build housing in the range of inclusionary housing on site.
 
 If the economics are not going to work, so when we have problems to do programs to do inclusion -- 
 
we need to do more in that area.
 
 Maybe we need to do an education process and learn more about that and what we can do to encourage more inclusionary.


Commissioner Miguel:


I was there as well, and it was a very, very excellent panel that basically said the other shoe has not dropped yet.
 
 In addition, I would like to mention from last Sunday's 
New York Times
, the article "Reinventing America's Cities --The Time is Now."
 
 I thought that was well done.

 DIRECTOR'S REPORT


 


3.
 
 Director's Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


 
 There are several items this week
.
 
 There was the community advisory committee, the CAC.
 
 That body has been appointed now and confirmed, and we are meeting.
 
 The first meeting was primarily focused on by laws and their role as defined in the ordinance.
 
 I think it was a successful first meeting.
 
 Several of you have mentioned that you want to have a joint meeting with the Small Business Commission.
 
 I received correspondence from the director of that commission also asking for that.
 
 So I will be meeting with her and we will organize a joint hearing with that commission.
 
 I think you heard testimony this morning from a man about the workshop focused around the civic center.
 
 This is to pull people together in a series of teams to look at ideas for creating a sustainable civic center.
 
 It happened Thursday and Friday of last week. There were a number of ideas that were put on the table.
 
 The workshop examined concerns about how things in the civic center were to be used.
 
 We are working with the Mayor's Office on what is being called a sustainable district in and around the civic center area.
 
 I also wanted to call your attention that in your packet today is a memo about the Action Plan.
 
 It is a status report and update of the Action Plan.
 
 I am happy to report that out of a list of about 30 items, we can check off that five are complete. 
 
We are making progress.
 
 We still have staff involved in this effort.
 
 There are a number of very interesting items that we are moving forward on.
 
 I think one of the most important ones for the department is that we are in the process of getting vendor bids for the permit tracking system. That will greatly help with our work with DBI and organizing all of the information around permit tracking.
 
 So if you have any questions, we would certainly be happy to answer those.
 
 And finally I wanted to mention that we are in the second phase of the public Housing Element. Staff is going out to community groups all over the city.
 
 I was told last week, I believe, that they had 25 meetings scheduled. And they are averaging at least two or three a week. 
 
The goal is to have a draft prepared by July 1.

San Andreas Pipeline No.3 Installation Project
 
- San Pedro Valve Lot (SPVL) in Daly City to Merced Manor Reservoir (MMR) in San Francisco. 
Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report
 - The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) is sponsoring a proposed project that requires the installation of approximately 23,400 feet (4.4 miles) of new pipeline to extend the existing San Andreas Pipeline No. 3 (SAPL3) from the San Pedro Valve Lot (SPVL) in Daly City to Merced Manor Reservoir (MMR) in San Francisco. For approximately half its length, the pipeline would follow the alignment of the abandoned Baden Merced Pipeline. Where the proposed SAPL 3 alignment differs from the existing BMPL alignment, the BMPL would either be filled with a concrete slurry mixture or would be capped. The alignment follows city streets, except in two locations (the San Francisco Golf Club and the Lake Merced Golf Club). The Project would be constructed using the open-trench method ( cut and cover ) for most of the pipeline and a trenchless ( jack and bore ) method at high-traffic intersections (at John Daly Boulevard and Sheffield Drive in Daly City, at 19th Avenue and Crespi/Holloway Avenue in San Francisco, and at 19th Avenue and Eucalyptus Drive in San Francisco). In addition to the pipeline main, the Project also includes the installation of crossover pipelines, five customer service connections, various underground vaults, appurtenances, and a cathodic projection system.
 


Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the Environmental Impact Report


Please note: The public hearing on the Draft EIR is closed. The public comment period for the Draft EIR ended on January 28, 2009. The Planning Commission does not conduct public review of Final EIRs. Public comments on the certification may be presented to the Planning Commission during the Public Comment portion of the Commission calendar
