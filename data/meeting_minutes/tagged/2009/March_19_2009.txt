COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS

 Commission Comments/Questions




Inquiries/Announcements
.
 
 Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).


Future Meetings/Agendas
.
 
 At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.




 


Commissioner Antonini:


I can't think of a more mindless and pointless and cruel crime than graffiti, especially in times when millions of dollars could be used for better purposed are being spent on eradication.
 
 There are some good articles that have been written recently that talked about other locations like Seattle and San Mateo County where the graffiti is less of a problem because they actually enforce a penalty on those who are convicted of graffiti crime.
 
 San Francisco Beautiful is having a  Zero Graffiti for a Beautiful City  on Thursday, April 23
rd
 at 750 Kearny.
 
 The second item:
 
 I did print out the report from the Controller.
 
 I would like to have more information on is the fact that in San Francisco public health and human services collectively amount to about 2 billion out of our total budget of about 6.5 billion.
 
 That seems to be a high percentage and I wonder how that compares with other places.
 
 At a time when we are faced with budget problems, it seems that we should look for efficiencies.
 
 Its an interesting subject and one I think we should take a look at and see what can be done.


 


Commissioner Moore:


I toured a talk the other day on implementation models and water-sensitive urban design.
 
 That talk was so good that I hope that the Planning commissioners could hear that talk.
 
 On the panel was a young woman from the Public Utilities Commission named Rosie Jinks, who is a Storm Water Management planner.
 
 She gave an excellent presentation of what they are doing.
 
 Everything feeds into many of the things we do, but I think we would be ahead of the curve if we understood what leads to this type of planning.
 
 There was a young man from the private industry whose name is Scott Durban from Sustainable Watershed Design.
 
 They both talked about urban issues related to San Francisco.
 
 I encourage us to have these people come to give us their part of the talk which was very worthwhile.


Director Rahaim responded:


Maybe we can talk to PUC and invite these people to give us a briefing.


Commissioner Moore
:


It was under the context of the Association of Environmental Professionals.
 
 It was at their annual meeting here for four days.


Commissioner Lee
:


What are the hours of the Public Information Office that we share with DBI and get a sense of what it's going to look like in the future?


Commissioner Sugaya:


He thanked Scott Sanchez for forwarding the memos on the status of the Academy of Art.
 
 I think we should have some kind of presentation in the near future to go over some questions that have arisen.
 
 Secondly, on the house that was demolished on Russian Hill.
 
 I'd like to know a little bit more about how CEQA plays in this kind of situation or how it doesn't.
 
 This was undoubtedly an historic resource.
 
 We know the circumstances.
 
 There was no opportunity for environmental review to come in because of the emergency situation.
 
 I'd just like to get some clarification on that point.


Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:


The language of Section 311, which is the operative ordinance under the Planning Code, says that with consultation of the Zoning Administrator, DBI, or Fire depending upon the issue once they declare an immanent safety hazard to issue a demolition report.
 
 I consult with the Environmental Review Officer or his designee.
 
 I actually signed off on that permit with a CEAQ and a California State guideline that exempts emergency actions.
 
 I don't remember the code sections, but if you want more detail, I can submit a memo to you or a report, but essentially there was a statutory exemption for emergency action.


Commissioner Sugaya:


When you get some time, I'd like you to get me those citations.


Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:


I'll have the ERO do that.


Commissioner Sugaya:


There is a new book out on graffiti in San Francisco.
 
 It has lots of color pictures inside.
 
 It's a nice publication.


Commissioner Borden:


There is a SPUR Young Urbanist Forum on Monday that is called Art in the Public Realm.
 
 They are going to be at the art studio at Minna and 8
th
 and they are going to looking at issues like graffiti art, murals, sculpture and other sort of public art.
 
 Going back to the Lombard Cottage, in the Chronicle they talked about preserving portions of the cottage and I was wondering what was going to happen with the preserved portions? 
 
It also begs the question of when we are going to have a joint meeting with DBI.
 
 When is that going to be on the calendar?
 
 When is Live Nation coming up [Masonic Auditorium]?
 


 


 


 


Zoning Administrator responded:


On the Masonic Auditorium question, I believe there has been a request that they do a traffic study.
 
 I don't know how long that study will take, but I suspect at least two months.


Commissioner Miguel:


I made that request.


Commissioner Borden:


On the DBI question?


Director Rahaim responded:


I think we decided to have it in late April or early May.


Commissioner Borden:


Do we know anything about the relocation of the cottage pieces?


Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:


I don't know anything about that.
 
 We can do some research, but I don't know what the status of that is.


Commissioner Miguel:


I also appreciate what Mr. Sanchez and done to bring us up to date on the Academy of Art, whom I met with this past week.
 
 I also met with people regarding 555 Washington and Trinity Properties as well as having a couple of meetings with Supervisors Campos and Mirkarimi separately on issues they or their constituents may have that could possibly affect the actions here at the Commission.


Commissioner Antonini:


I also met with Trinity and the Academy of Art Institute.
 
 I also met with project sponsors on 555 Washington.

 DIRECTOR'S REPORT

 Director's Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


This morning I attended the San Francisco Leadership class.
 
 They asked me to come and talk about the role/functions of the Planning Department.
 
 They were doing a tour of the Transbay area after my presentation.
 
 Last night was the public meeting on Sea Wall lot 337.
 
 The public was given the opportunity to view the presentations of the proposed developers.
 
 I'm on the advisory committee to advise the Port on the selection of a developer.
 
 The Advisory Committee is meeting this week also to go over the proposal in detail and talk about concerns and questions as well. 
 
The two final developers combined to form one development team on that site.
 
 A number of changes have come about as a result of the economic situation from when the process was begun.
 
 Next week I'm attending the meeting of the West of Twin Peaks Council.
 
 They have asked me to their monthly meeting next Tuesday to talk about a range of issues of interest to that group.
 
 And finally I want to let you and the public know that the first meeting of the Community Advisory Council for the Market and Octavia Plan is on April 1
st
.
 
 It will be 6:30 p.m. at the Department and it is open to the public.


Zoning Administrator Badiner:


The Public Information Counter (PIC) has traditionally been open from 8 until 5, five days a week.
 
 As you are aware, there has been a downturn in the economy and we often find that at times there is not a lot to do, but at other times there is a rush.
 
 We have explored a lot of different options to save our resources and make sure we have availability to the public.
 
 We ultimately came up with the idea, because DBI closes every Wednesday from 8:30 to 10:30 in the morning, to close Wednesday mornings until 12 or 12:30 and also late Friday afternoon.
 
 We have heard concerns about that.
 
 We are re-examining that.
 
 We are talking with DBI about the best way to do this.
 
 We serve two functions at the PIC.
 
 One is information and the other is signing off on permits.
 
 Something like 90% of DBI's permits are signed off over the counter.
 
 If we are not there to sign off on them, they don't get signed off. 
 
That is a problem.
 
 So we are working with DBI.
 
 I expect those recent changes will be refined.
 
 But we are also trying to find the best way to harbor our resources and not have people standing around and yet serve the public.
 
 I think it's going through some rough patches, but we are aware of them and are trying to address them.

BOARD OF APPEALS


 


Although there was no meeting last night, the Board did send a letter to Director Rahaim acknowledging Tina Tam's contribution to the representation of the Department and how well she had done that, and congratulated her on her re-assignment to the Historic Preservation Officer.
 
 They are very impressed with her work and wanted the Department to know that and I think you should know that also.
 


 


HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION


 


They met yesterday and Acting President Chase presented a resolution acknowledging Mark Luellen., complementing him for his contributions to the Preservation Technical Specialist and Historic Preservation Officer under the Department and wishing him the best as he becomes the Northeast Team Leader.
 
 Commissioners Damkroger and Martinez asked for a report on 1268 Lombard Street, and specifically on the 2000 landmark designation.
 
 Ms. Sullivan made a presentation on Articles 10 & 11.
 
 There is a joint hearing with the Planning Commission on this issue on April 2
nd
.
 
 They also had before them the landmark designation of the Metro Theatre at 2055 Union Street.
 
 Because they only have four commissioners at this time, they must have unanimous votes to pass or deny items before them.
 
 On this issue the vote was 3 to 1 with Commissioner Damkroger dissenting for a motion to preserve the exterior and inside murals.
 
 The motion failed, but under the code as it is written now, it becomes a procedural approval without any specific recommendations.

SPEAKERS:


 




Tony Kelly – Potrero Boosters




Re:
 
 
 
 Last week I came before you speak about a specific project that I think should have been rejected by Planning staff before it got to you.
 
 Planning staff said that they were bound by the law and had to bring the matter before you and I was mistaken.
 
 I stand by my initial statement.


 




Jazzy Collins – South of Market Community Action Network




Re:
 
 Continue the Trinity Plaza project to 4/9/09 to allow the community impacted by this project more time to participate.
