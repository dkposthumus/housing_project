CLASSROOM BUILDINGS AND CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM BUILDING
AND PARKING STRUCTURE: Assessor's Block 1029, Lots 001-003, southwest corner
of California Street/Broderick Street intersection. To consider

of the Preliminary Negative Declaration on the proposed project. 
The
site currently contains a private co-educational high school (Drew College
Preparatory School) comprised of three buildings that total about 16,300
square feet and an exterior courtyard. The proposed project would involve
merging the three lots into one lot; demolishing the three existing buildings;

about 33,800 square feet, a basement parking garage with about 23 parking
spaces, and an exterior courtyard. The current enrollment at the high school
is about 200 students. The project sponsor proposes a maximum enrollment
of about 250 students and seeks an enrollment cap of about 399 students.
The project sponsor would seek a Variance from the rear yard and front
yard set-back requirements of the San Francisco Planning Code
 
and
a Conditional Use Authorization for expansion of a secondary school in
an RM-1 Zoning District.
