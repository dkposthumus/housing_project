700-768 SEVENTH STREET (601 TOWNSEND STREET)
; westside of Seventh
Street at Townsend Street; Lots 1, 4, 5 and 6 in Assessor's Block 3799;
within an M-2 (Heavy Industrial) zoning district and a 50-X height and
bulk district. 
Appeal of Preliminary Negative Declaration
. The proposed
project would convert the Baker & Hamilton Building, City Landmark
#193, from retail sales/warehouse to office use. The basement would remain
in storage use, as at present. Interior and minor exterior alterations
are proposed. Proposed on the adjacent undeveloped lots now used for parking
(Lots 4, 5, and 6) is the new construction of a 318-space, 50-foot-tall
parking garage, fronting on King Street, and a four-story, 50-foot-tall
office building, fronting on Townsend Street. The Baker & Hamilton
Building rehabilitation would result in approximately 216,250 gross square
feet (gsf) of office space and about 73,500 gsf of basement storage space.
The new office building, to the west, would contain about 57,400 gsf of
office space.
