architects and neighborhood residents when considering alterations or new
construction on homes within the residential area surrounding Mt. Davidson,
generally bounded by Portola Drive, O’Shaughnessy Boulevard and
Teresita/Melrose/Lansdale/Miraloma Streets. The Miraloma Park Design
Guidelines, authored by the Miraloma Park Improvement Club, were first proposed
to the Planning Commission for adoption in 1996, at which time the Planning
Commission adopted a motion of intent to endorse the Guidelines when they were
completed. The Guidelines are now fully prepared, including graphic materials,
and are proposed for endorsement by the Commission. Property owners who wish to
expand or construct buildings within the subject area would continue to be
subject to Planning Code Section 311 notice and the citywide Residential Design
Guidelines review procedures, and, in addition, would be asked to consider the
more specific Miraloma Park Design Guidelines in their project site planning
and design.
