FAIR HOUSING AMENDMENT
 - - Consideration
of a proposal to amend the Part II, Chapter II, of the San Francisco Municipal
Code ("Planning Code") by amending Sections 303 and 305 to require that,
in considering applications involving dwellings in which "protected class
members" are likely to reside, the Planning Commission in considering conditional
uses or the Zoning Administrator or Board of Appeals, on appeal, in considering
variances shall comply with Chapter 87 of the San Francisco Administrative
Code which requires, among other things, that these bodies not base any
decision regarding such dwellings on information which may be discriminatory
to a protected class. A protected class is a group that could potentially
be discriminated against on the basis of a number of factors as specified
in State and federal anti-discrimination law. These factors include but
are not limited to race, religion, color, ancestry, ethnicity, age, sex,
sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, source of income, place

CONSIDERATION OF INTERIM ZONING CONTROLS
 to establish an industrial
protection zone where new residential and live/work uses would not be permitted
and where demolition of industrial buildings would require a conditional
use authorization, a mixed use area where residential and live/work uses
would be encouraged, and buffer zones where residential and live work uses
would require conditional use authorization.
 
The interim zoning
controls would apply to all lots zoned M-1, M-2, C-M, RSD, SLR, SLI, SPD,
SSO in the area generally bounded by Market Street from the Embarcadero
to Valencia Street, south to Twenty-fourth Street, east to Highway 101,
Highway 280 and south along Mission Street to Geneva Street, and then east
to the County line and the eastern shoreline, exclusive of lots under the
jurisdiction of the San Francisco Port, and lots in the Mission Bay North
and Mission Bay South Redevelopment Project Areas, the Hunters Point Shipyard
Redevelopment Project Area, the Rincon Point/South Beach Redevelopment
Project Area and the Transbay Survey area. The interim zoning controls
would be in effect for a period of fifteen (15) months.

 

The purpose of the June 24 hearing is to receive testimony from the
public concerning inclusion or exclusion of specific properties within
the boundaries of the proposed protection and buffer zones, after which
testimony the hearing will be continued to a future date.

 

Final action on the Interim Controls will not occur until the Environmental
Review is complete. At the future hearing the Commission may modify the
area affected by the proposed amendment or modify the text of the controls
in a manner that places greater or lesser restriction on the use of property.
