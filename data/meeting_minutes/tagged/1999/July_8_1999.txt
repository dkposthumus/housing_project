of a new six-story horizontal extension of the existing five-story Neiman
Marcus store building on the site. In addition to the construction of the
new extension building, the project would also add a partial sixth story
to the existing Neiman Marcus building and would include a small infill

existing "checkerboard" or "harlequin" exterior finish of the existing
store through sandblasting of the granite facade and replace the existing
window treatments at the main store entrance. The existing pedestrian entrance
on Geary Street would be moved eastward to the front of the new extension
building while the loading docks would also be moved to the new extension
structure at the rear accessed from Security Pacific Place.
