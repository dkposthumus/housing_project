Appeal of Preliminary Mitigated Negative
        Declaration
 for the proposed project entailing 1) subdivision of an existing
        7,500-square foot parcel into two lots, resulting in an approximately 4,200-sq
        ft lot with 42 feet of frontage along Belgrave Avenue containing an existing
        single-family residence, and a second undeveloped approximately 3,300-sq ft
        parcel with 33 feet of frontage along Belgrave Avenue to the west of the
        existing building; 2) enlarging an existing 2,270-sq ft residence by
        approximately 2,000 sq ft, resulting in an approximately 4,210-sq ft,
        approximately 37-foot-high building with two off-street parking spaces; and 3)
        construction of a new approximately 3,971-sq ft, 37-foot-high three-story-over
        two-car garage single-family residence. The project site is located within an
        RH-1(D) (Residential House, One-Family (Detached Dwelling)) District and a 40-X
        Height and Bulk District in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. The proposed
        project would require a variance from the minimum lot area requirements.

Commissioner Antonini
:
         




As is the case with most
        of you, I watched the Super Bowl. Having been in Indianapolis in the not too
        distant past, I wanted to see how it worked with that many people there. It's a
        city with a population not much below San Francisco’s, but it is more spread
        out. Their downtown area is pretty dense. I did not notice a lot of traffic even
        though they have three great facilities within walking distance of each other.
        The thing that they do and something that was instructive as people are entering
        the area off the freeways and expressways, they have easy access into garages
        where it's not confusing to park their cars and take public transit, that's one
        thing we have to look at. Not everyone is going to take public transit into San
        Francisco, particularly people from outlying areas or visiting from other parts
        of the area.  We have to make it easy for them to get around on public
        transportation. That worked quite well in Indianapolis. I don' t know if this is
        in the context of something we are discussing later on, but that is an important
        thing to look at as we look at future planning. 





        President Miguel: 




I had meetings during the
        past week with people from a project that may be coming to us regarding 20
th

          Street and Connecticut Street. I attended a meeting that was put together by
        Supervisor Campo's office, which we sent back to do more neighborhood outreach.
        I read a very interesting article in the New York Times last week regarding
        formula retail and how they hope to handle the proposed legislation.  They are
        handling it on the ground floor with spaces of 40 feet; financial institutions
        with only 25 feet of width on the street – it takes up as much as three-quarters
        of a block frontage. If any of the Commissioners are interested in reading this
        article, I have it here. I thought it was a different approach and it would be
        interesting to see how that happens there. I had the pleasure of having lunch
        with the Commissioner appointee, until she is sworn in this afternoon, Cindy Wu.
        I will probably make more comments when she joins us next week. It is going to
        be a very welcome addition to the Commission.

        Director’s Announcements




           
                    





        Director Rahaim:





        I also want to welcome Cindy Wu to the Commission.  She will be joining us next
        week at the Commission. My only other announcement is both for the Commission
        and the public – I want to announce the kickoff meeting for our green
        connections program. I believe the Commission received invitations to this. This
        will happen on February 15, from 5:30 to 7:30 at the LGTB, 1800 Market Street.
        This is a program we are working on in conjunction with the Parks Department
        which was the results of the ROSE identified in recreation and workspace as the
        item.  We were awarded with a six-thousand dollar grant from the State to work
        on this. It is intended to better connect the City neighborhoods to our open
        spaces and wild life.  The focus the first year will be establishing broad
        connections; and in the second year the focus will be on the design of
        particular streets to reinforce these connections.  Staff is very excited about
        this program and we were lucky to receive the grants to work on this.

        The Ordinances would allow the demolition of the existing two-story mixed-use
        building without the prior review and approval of a replacement building. The
        building contains 18 residential dwelling-units located above 8 ground floor
        businesses.  This Commission approved the Ordinances on Jan 26.  
This week
        the legislative sponsor stated that there were some unanswered questions about
        the replacement housing.  The item was continued to 2/13.

        The culminating approvals of a 10 year community planning effort were heard by
        the LU committee this week.  The Commission considered these Ordinances and
        recommended approval on November 10, 2012.  At that time, the Commission
        approved the documents as drafted.  This week Supervisor Wiener officially
        sponsored the legislation and recommended approval to the Committee.  Department
        staff provided an overview of the Plan and the proposed Ordinances. The
        Supervisors’ comments included a strong interest in seeing transportation
        projects implementation by the SFMTA.  Public comment was provided in support of
        the Plan by a local neighborhood group, the Glen Park Association.  
The full
        Board approved the Ordinances on first reading.

Appeal of CU Authorization for
        Wireless Antennas at 601 14
th
 Ave.  


This WTS facility
        was proposed for the Jewish Bureau of Education.
 
This Commission approved
        the CU on Dec 6
th
.  The appellant was the First Slavic Baptist Church
        of San Francisco.  The appellants had concerns about radiofrequency radiation,
        the siting on an educational facility, and the lack of independent analysis of
        “capacity & coverage”.  Staff explained that this case, the CU was approved
        prior to the Commission’s most recent revision of the Siting Guidelines, which
        now require this independent analysis as part of the submittal documents.  While
        we had asked AT&T to voluntarily pursue such analysis, they were unable to do so
        prior to the hearing.  The Department explained that this location, as a
        preference one location, is exactly where the City has requested that cell
        providers locate their antennas.  Finally, we were joined at the hearing by DPH
        staff. Together, we described the site would be safe according to science
        developed over 3 decades of study and more than 25,000 studies. Two supervisors
        (Olague and Mar) requested that the Siting process be updated.  
With a 9-1
        vote, the CU was upheld.  Supervisor Mar cast the dissenting vote and in the
        meeting minutes he requested that DPH provide pre-installation and
        post-installation readings of cumulative RF at the site to better inform the
        public about the levels of RF in the area.
