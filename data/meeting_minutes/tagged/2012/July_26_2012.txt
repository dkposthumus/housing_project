Commissioner Moore
:  


I am wondering if the City Attorney could give us an explanation regarding 8 Washington, due to the fact that I have never on my time on the Commission seen a Commission decision and Board of Supervisors' decision move to the potential of the ballot box. I understand sufficient signatures were submitted for that to happen in putting this on the ballot. 


Susan Cleveland-Knowels, Deputy City Attorney


We can give you a more in depth update either later today or next week but, in general, any legislative decision can be reprimanded within 30 days of that decision through the collection of a certain number of signatures and other procedures.  In terms of moving forward now, I understand the Board of Supervisors has an opportunity to consider the project one more time before it goes to a vote of the people. That is what I know at this point. But if you have other questions, I would have to look into that at a later date.


Commissioner Moore:


I was curious about the process because few of us have seen it under the microscope. It has not happened for a long time. It would be fun to hear. 


I have a second point while we are asking questions. We might want to discuss what the real entitlement process really should or should not do. We have over the last six to eight months because of changing economic trends, been bombarded with large projects.  I am not referring to anything on today's calendar. But generally I want to know like on consumer products there is a date of expiration, do we have something like that as well? Do city plans change? We are sometimes carrying projects around 8-10 or however …; many years go without actually taking a closer look at them.  Revisiting an architectural solution; revisiting some of the land use assumptions; is that anything that would be in the interest of this Commission to consider? I would obviously ask that the Mayor's Office of Economic Development might look into this, or everyone else could also. But I think it is an idea given that we have already had this new development project on the City for far too long. 


Commissioner Antonini: 


In response to the question from Commissioner Moore, I think there have been some attempts at ballot measures, but I do not think any of them in the past got enough to qualify during my tenure on the Planning Commission. I know in another jurisdiction there was an attempt and some demonstrated action. There are time concerns and everything else. I think the City Attorney will brief us on the various parameters around these types of things. 


On another note, I am really encouraged to see the spirit of cooperation between the branches of city government in the past few days, with particular reference to the budget, and the measures that will be on the ballot, like the tax reforms. While we still have to look at these particular measures in detail, it is encouraging to see various branches working in harmony. I am hopeful that spirit of cooperation continues until next Tuesday as the Board of Supervisors will consider my reappointment to the Planning Commission.  I would like to continue for another four years. Almost everyone knows where to get a hold of me, but for those of you that did not have my contact information you can call me day or night on my cell phone. I turn it off at night, so I would never be up in the middle of the night. I have received comments from many people over the years, but I want to make sure we cast the net as broadly as possible so everyone can get a hold of me if they have issues or concerns. Thank you very much


Commissioner Sugaya:


This morning's newspaper had an article about the item on the agenda today. The article made the same error that people make all the time with this when they testify before the Commission on an environmental impact report. A draft environmental impact report has to have a hearing before the Planning Commission, and when people come to testify at that hearing, many people make the assumption that they are testifying about the project or plan, and that is not the case. Comments should be made, as always explained by staff on the accuracy of the environmental impact report itself. The report is quite different than the plan or project. The time to comment on the project or plan comes later. Often times it is three-six months later. At that time the commission will take up the actual project and make a decision at that time. The article perpetuated that error by saying people should come and testify today on the plan, and in this case we are not having a hearing on the plan, we are having a hearing on the environmental report. The article compounded the confusion that will take place later this afternoon. 


Secondly, another article about BART and the elevators that are out of commission due to the things that take place.  I think there is a simple solution, which people have been talking about for years, and that is cover the escalators when they are not running.  For some reason they have never consider putting shelter over the top of the escalators, which I understand will help long-term maintenance.


Commissioner Moore
: 


Perhaps it is fair to say perhaps those journalists who do not know the City processes, that perhaps the Planning Department could make itself available to give updates and distinguished what kind of process produces what.

Director’s Announcements


 


            
Director Rahaim:


First, I want to announce I believe you got the media announcement of the new selection for the Current Planning Director for the Department. That position is the one that oversees the entitlement process and zoning process, including preservation and public information counter and manages the largest group in the department of over 50 people. That position was offered and accepted by Jeff Joslin, He is an architect. For 13 years he managed the land use, the urban design and preservation teams for the City of Portland, including management of the Portland Design Commission and Historic Landmarks Commission, and in the past five or six years has been a private consultant and developer. He brings a very strong range of experience to the Department and the City. He will be starting his position officially in October, but will be coming to the City for several weeks in August and September and would like to see both Commission meetings in August, so you will have a chance to meet him at that time as well. Secondly, I would like to introduce several of the intern's. We have 16 interns at the Department this summer. There are five of them here today. We have had over 450 applicants for this program from all over the world.  We're very excited about them being here this summer. Let me just briefly talk about some of the projects they're working on. There is a project to assist the preservation data collection and identification of the historic districts, and revise the web site content to focus primarily on getting information to the public about existing local landmarks. There is a land use survey going on in various labor commercial districts to help us do some of the work. There is also the Invest in Neighborhoods Program, which has been an issue -- and interest to the department for several years. Work is going on with Connections, a program you heard about in the past, which is conducting research and compiling information on best practices. We're going on to enhance the transportation demand management programs. There is information on urban food systems within the City, collecting information about that and about what the City and other places in the region do. We're working on the driveway standards guidelines and analyzing the information from 2000-2010 Census. There is work assisting AnMarie Rodgers of the Legislative Team and responding to inquiries and further work, which as been going on for quite some time, research and creation of the archeological district. As part of the call-week program, each mentor has a planner to manage and supervise their work. Last week I understand Commissioner Wu invited the interns to Chinatown. Thank you. They really enjoyed that. There was a discussion about planning in the non-profit sector. In the final week of the program they will present the work to staff during a noontime series. We are very happy to have them all. I like to read off the list of names. Susan Parks, Denise Low, Alexandra Curby, Joseph Kramer, Ben Caldwell, Wendy Chen, Angela Lock, and Sarah Mullins. Thank you all. We're really happy to have you here.

11.
          
Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.


 


LAND USE COMMITTEE: 




120528 Mills Act Amendments.  
This Ordinance sponsored by Supervisor Wiener would 1) amend the Administrative Code to: a) to add limitations on eligibility, b) to add application deadlines, c) to add a time limit for receipt of the Assessor-Recorder's report, d) to require use of a standard form contract, and e) to require departmental monitoring reports.  It also would  amend the Planning Code Section 356 to reduce the application fee for Mills Act contracts.  Both the PC & the HPC reviewed the Ordinance.  The recommendations of both commissions were the same 1) minor, technical changes and 2) one substantive change removing the value limit of $3 million for residential properties and $5 million for commercial properties.  
Supervisor Wiener incorporated the changes of the Commissions and the item was recommended with approval to the Board.
 


120241 New Sunset NCDs.  
The Commission heard this item on June 14 and voted 7-0 to recommend approval with modifications.  The proposed legislation would create new named NCDs in the Outer Sunset and make changes to the Trade Shop definition.  The proposed ordinance was amended to include most  of  the Commission recommendations, however instead of 3 new named NCDs, the legislation proposes 4 new named NCDs—one for each street.  
(Starr) 
(The full board approved the Ordinance on first reading this week.)
 


There were three Ordinances that were part of the larger NE Legislation introduced by President Chiu.  
When this Commission considered the NE legislation, you voted on it in three separate phases.  The majority of the Commission’s recommendations are included in the revised Ordinances.  One exception is the controls for the LCCUs.  The Commission recommended keeping the controls the same (maximum of 1,200 sq. ft. and no more than 50’ from the corner). The Supervisor choose to maintain the controls for LCCUs in the Market and Octavia RTO Districts per the Commission’s request.  However, he choose to differ from this request by allowing larger LCCUs in the RM and RTO-M Districts (100’ from the corner and 2,500 sq. ft.).




120715 LCUs (Starr) 
(The full board amended the Ordinance and then approved it first reading this week.)
 


120472 Clerical Modifications (Starr) 
(The full board approved the Ordinance on first reading this week.)
 


120471 Bicycle Parking, Auto Service Station (Starr) 
(Olague added herself as a sponsor at the FB hearing.  Then, the full board approved the Ordinance on first reading this week.)
 






11347 Student Housing.  
This proposed Ordinance would establish a definition and land use controls for student housing.  It was originally sponsored by this Commission and has been sponsored by Supervisor Wiener at the Board.  During the winter Supervisor Wiener signed on as the Board sponsor and amended the Ordinance to provide for a few limited exceptions.  This Commission considered the Ordinance in May and June of this year.  At your hearings you supported the exceptions and additional incentives for the production of new housing—while standing firm that you would not support the conversion of the existing housing stock.  
The Supervisor incorporated your many recommendations and the LU Committee recommended approval of this Ordinance to the Full Board.
 


120252 City’s Response to ADA 
This hearing was called in response to ADA Lawsuits brought against the owners of small businesses.  The hearing was staffed by the City Attorney’s office, DPW, Small Business Commission, Department of Building Inspection, Mayor’s Office and Planning.  Our presentation focused on the recently awarded Certified Local Government Grant that will enable us to develop store-front guidelines for compliance with both ADA and Historic Resource controls.  Supervisors heard about the pending Ordinance sponsored by Board President Chiu that would require information about ADA compliance within commercial leases.  
The hearing was informational and no action was taken. 
 
(Frye, Varat)
 




FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: 




Charter Amendment Housing Trust Fund.  
Supervisors Wiener, Kim, Avalos, Cohen, Olague, and Board President Chiu strongly in support of this Ordinance. Supervisor Campos supported the proposed Ordinance but regretted that this was not funded by a property transfer tax.  
This week the Board voted to submit this Charter Amendments to the voters in the upcoming election.
 


TCDP.  
On Monday July 16 the Land Use Committee held a hearing on the Transit Center District Plan, including all of the ordinances approved by this Commission in May. Board sponsor Kim, thanked staff and the Commission for their work on this important project for our downtown. Supervisor Mar felt the shadows were not significant compared to the huge amount of open space and street realm improvements that would be provided.  He agreed it was a tremendous project.  Supervisor Board President Chiu appreciated the work that had been done to mitigate shadow impacts on parks in his district.  
The Board approved the Ordinance unanimously on first reading. 


8 Washington.  
Also at this hearing the Board President announced that the Clerk of the Board is in receipt of a Referendum Petition against Ordinance No. 104-12.  This is the Zoning Map amendment for the 8 Washington Street Project. This referendum has been forwarded to the Department of Elections for verification and validation. The Department of Elections must notify the Board about the validity of this referendum  by August 30, 2012
[1]
.  At this point, the ordinance is suspended from becoming effective. If the referendum petition qualifies, the Board of Supervisors will reconsider the ordinance at an upcoming meeting. At that meeting the Board may repeal or adopt (again) the Ordinance.  If this Ordinance is not repealed, the Board shall submit the ordinance to the voters at the next election on November 6, 2012.
 




Appeals:  




601 Dolores CEQA Appeal (Turrel, Lewis)
 


601 Dolores CU Appeal (Rodgers, Smith)
 




This Commission approved a CU for this project on April 26 of this year.  The project would allow the conversion of a single-family dwelling into a private elementary school operated by Children’s Day School.  The appellants raised questions about compliance with the General Plan and that the project may not have been “exempt” from CEQA review.  At the start of the hearing, district Supervisor  Wiener announced that an agreement had been reached between the two parties.  The agreement would result in a reduction of the rooftop open space as well as the hours of use for this space.  
With that agreement in mind, the Board voted to uphold the Cat Ex and then to overturn the CU so the new conditions could be added.

The proposal would extend the approval for determination of compliance under Planning Code Section 309.1 under Motion No. 18411 for an additional 12 months.  The approved proposal was to construct a new residential project in a 400-foot building that would consist of approximately 452 dwelling units, up to 238 off-street parking spaces, and for the granting of exceptions to allow greater than one parking space for every two dwelling units under Planning Code Sections 151.1(d) and 309.1(b)(1)(b), for reduction of the dwelling unit exposure requirements under Planning Code Sections 140 and 309.1(b)(1)(d), and to provide exceptions to the separation of towers requirement under Planning Code Sections 270(e) and 309.1(b)(1)(a).  The approval period would be extended to June 15, 2013.  The Director of the Planning Department recommends approval to the extension request and a written report is available for public review at the office of the Planning Department.  
Exterior design changes are proposed in addition to the extension request.

Western SoMa Community Plan, Rezoning of Adjacent Parcels, and 350 Eighth Street Project
 - 
Public Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Report
. 
 
The
 
proposed project consists of three components: 1) The first component is the Draft 
Western SoMa Community Plan
, which covers an irregularly shaped plan area consisting of two connected areas: one roughly bounded by 13th, Bryant, Seventh, and Minna Streets, and the second area roughly bounded by Townsend, Fourth, Harrison, and Seventh Streets. The plan would require amendments to the 
San Francisco General Plan
 as well as changes to use and height and bulk controls in the 
San Francisco
 
Planning Code
. The plan also includes policies for transportation improvements. 2) The second component is the rezoning of approximately 46 parcels adjacent to the Plan Area (generally bounded by Seventh, Ninth, Mission, and Minna Streets) in order to reconcile their use districts and height and bulk districts with those of the neighboring properties. 3) The third component is a proposed mixed
â
use development at 350 8th Street (Block 3756, Lots 3 and 15) that would include approximately 444 dwelling units, 33,650 sq. ft. of commercial space, 8,150 sq. ft. of light industrial/artist space, and 1,350 sq. ft. of community space.   
Written comments will be accepted at the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m. on August 6, 2012.

The Department of Election will commence a random count, which is 3% of the signatures received. If the Department of Elections determines that the random count of the signatures is valid, the Department of Elections will certify such. However, if the random count shows that the valid signatures are within 95 to 110 percent of the requisite signatures, there will be a full 100% verification of the signatures that were filed. Once the referendum petitions are found to be sufficient, the Department of Elections will notify the Clerk’s Office and we will place the ordinance on the next Board agenda for reconsideration.
