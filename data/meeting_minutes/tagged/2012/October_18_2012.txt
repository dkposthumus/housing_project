Commissioner Borden:


Today is California West Coast Shake Out which is to create awareness around earthquake preparedness. It happened at 10:18 A.M., and 9 million Californians participated. The whole idea was to stop, drop and cover. Basically, in the case of a disaster, you need to get under a sturdy piece of furniture or doorway – preferably under a piece of furniture if things are falling. I also wanted the public to know that the Red Cross launched an earthquake app available on both IPhone and Android. You can download the plan; send it to your family members; store your information; and find where shelters are in your community. You can get notifications when there are earthquakes in various places. You have the apps to click a button to say ‘I'm okay.’ So, if there is an earthquake your family members can find out about it. I wanted to make sure the public was aware this resource exists.  I was thinking about preparedness since we live in an earthquake zone.


Commissioner Antonini:
 


Number one: just acknowledging that the American Dental Association is meeting in San Francisco beginning today through Sunday.  It's a large convention and we're happy to have it and we're one of a rotation of three or four cities that is able to host that throughout the country. Secondly, the [Joint] Subcommittees met last week and will meet again this coming Wednesday on the 24
th
 to move forward.  We will discuss that when we can with the [Commission] body as a whole, it's actually going to be calendared in the future if I'm not mistaken. And thirdly, I always wonder why we've been so fortunate in San Francisco to be the origin of so many innovative projects, inventions, concepts and businesses. Everywhere you go, you see things that were invented here. You see businesses that began here worldwide, not in the region, but specifically in the 49 square miles of San Francisco, and, of course, you know, obviously at the beginning of the port. The advantage of having the bay was the first factor. But I also think that one other advantage we have is our weather. Although everyone loves today's weather out there, I think if you have to do things in this heat and have to go long distances, it sort of may discourage your creativity. So, we're kind of blessed with, you know, a milder climate that makes you feel like doing things and that may be another reason and we also have generally, at least in the downtown area, fairly flat areas from which to communicate with one another. There's a book called "The Importance of Cities," and the author was noted as saying “large dense cities influence productivity;” and, you know, the utilization of the creative sectors in particular. He also says that the denseness results in knowledge spillovers which, you know, is one reason why one business attracts another close to it. Everybody talks about IPhones and electronic communications, but a lot of the spillover is still word of mouth, especially the more sensitive parts of it that, you know, can't be traced. If it's just a conversation, so, that's another reason maybe why businesses bunch together in areas where they're close to each other physically. So, interesting reading, and I found that to be quite interesting.


Commissioner Moore:


I have asked the Director, actually, to give this Securities and Exchange Commission and the public an update regarding an e-mail I received yesterday regarding the festival which is supposed to take place this week on Urban Prototyping. I could not even actually capture the abbreviation [of it], but I don't want to speak, but want him to speak to explain it to us.

6.         Director’s Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


I just did want to report on this Urban Prototyping Festival that Commissioner Moore mentioned earlier. It is sponsored by the -- I forget the name of the organization all of a sudden -- the Bay Area Foundation for the Arts. It is a nonprofit based here in San Francisco, and the festival is essentially a day-long event that is focused on the public realm, but specifically about the interaction of urban design, public art and technology, and how those three interdisciplinary field can come together and address issues of the public. In fact, festival may be an incorrect word. Part of the event is essentially a workshop were folks from those three disciplines come together and create prototypes for thinking of the public environment in a different way.  They will be posting these.  The idea of these is that they can be replicated across the country. It is taking place Saturday -- I forget the hours, excuse me -- I believe it's from Noon to 10:00 P.M. and it's taking place around the streets of 5th and Mission - around the Old Chronicle properties. Literally they'll be closing off those alleys on the southwest corner of 5th and Mission where The Chronicle buildings are today. There are some speakers between roughly 12:00 and 4:00. I will be speaking late in the program just in general about the City's growth and how we're thinking about the public realm. And then later in the afternoon and evening there will be music and other events going on as well. But it's a very interesting. I think the most interesting part of it to me is that the interdisciplinary actions on how one might address the public realm differently and it is meant to be replicable in cities across the country. We certainly welcome your participation.

7.         Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.


 


LAND USE COMMITTEE: 


·
         
Lastly another Ordinance that would amend the Administrative Code to ensure the “
Right to Return to Revitalized Public Housing
” also sponsored by Supervisor Olague was heard.  The Planning Commission heard this item on Sept 27, at that time the Supervisor was still working with MOH and SFHA on changes so this commission recommended approval of the “return policy” but did not take a position on the details which were in flux.  Since your hearing the Supervisor continued to work with both agencies and the Ordinance was amended with their support in early October.  
This week the ordinance was unanimously recommended for approval to the Full Board. 


FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: 




The Update to the Community Safety Element of the General Plan was heard at committee this week.  The Commission recommended approval of this on June 14, 2012. 
This week the Board approved the ordinance on FINAL Reading.
 


The Ordinance that would 
change the threshold for the Inclusionary Affordable Housing program
 from buildings with 5 or more units to those with 10 or more was heard this week for final reading.  This Commission recommended approval of the Ordinance on June 16th.  This Ordinance is the “companion” legislation to the Housing Trust Fund and would only become effective if the voters approve the HTF in this November’s election
[1]
. Further, as this was amended by the Board last week, the City would be able to monitor the effect on housing production of this change and could decide to reinstate this fee at a later date if desired. 
With these amendments, the Ordinance was approved on FINAL reading by the Board. It is now sponsored by the Mayor, President Chiu and Supervisors Kim, Wiener, Cohen and Chu.
 


TIDF.  
The Planning Commission heard the TIDF Update ordinance on July 19, 2012 The Planning Commission recommended approval of the ordinance with modifications
[2]
.  The Mayor introduced substitute legislation included all of your recommendations.  
This week the Full Board continued the Ordinance to November 20 without discussion. 


The Board heard an Ordinance that would strengthen existing laws intended to restrict the conversion of apartment units to tourist or short-term use, a practice commonly known as hotelization.  The sponsor, Board President Chiu, described that the legislation clarifies that corporate entities cannot skirt our laws by signing long term leases of residential apartments for planned occupancies of less than 30 days. It also strengthens the enforcement process by creating an administrative review hearing for the Department of Building Inspection to evaluate complaints and by giving our residents the ability to seek legal recourse through the assistance of non-profit organizations. Last week, this Commission asked if this law would apply to rental housing as well as units owned by a corporation—and the answer was Yes, short-term rentals of residential units would not be allowed regardless of the ownership structure.   
This week the Board approved the Ordinance on first reading.
 


The board considered an ordinance that would provide a 
5’ height bonus for active uses in the Castro NCD and 24
th
 Noe NCD
.  This commission  recommended approval on September 27.  This week the Board approved the Ordinance on First reading.
 


The hearing of the  Housing Production and Reports Ordinance 
was interesting.  This Ordinance was before you on June 28 and approved with modifications. Supervisor Olague adopted most all the modifications recommended by this Commission and worked closely with staff and the Planning Director to make some minor changes. Supervisor Wiener had voted against this item in Committee and this week he proposed amendments to the Ordinance. Supervisor Weiner expressed a desire to produce a complete picture view of housing production: low income; middle income housing, senior housing; and various size of units. He proposed adding these additional categories to the dashboard and a change to when the dashboard would be required.  Supervisor Olague’s ordinance would require the dashboard for any reports associated with projects that have 5 or more residential units. His amendment would only require that the dashboard be added for those projects which are heard by the Planning Commission—it was this later amendment that Supervisor Olague objected to.  She expressed concern that the Plan Areas would enable additional projects to be approved without Commission review and that the dashboard should be considered for these projects too.  Planning Department staff clarified that the Department does not produce reports for projects which are not heard by the Commission—instead these projects are plan checked and only approved if they are code compliant.  Requiring the publication of the dashboard with these projects would potentially require the Department to spend additional time and create additional expense for code complaint projects as a report may be required where none is currently done. Board President Chiu asked if we could attach the Dashboard to any additional reports that would not currently be required by Olague’s ordinance—staff responded that we could attach the dashboard to projects that go before the Historic Preservation Commission and/or the appeal of housing projects before the Board of Supervisors.  Supervisors Campos and Kim discussed the alternatives and then Supervisor Olague asked for a week continuance to work on these issues.  
With that the item was continued.
 






 




 


 


INTRODUCTIONS:


10/2/12:


§
  
120220 v.2
 
Planning Code - Signage Requirements for Privately-Owned Public Open Spaces.
 Ordinance amending the San Francisco Planning Code to: 1) consolidate into Section 138 the requirements for privately-owned public open space; 2) create a new Zoning Administrator Bulletin that will contain detailed design and graphics requirements for the required informational plaques.

10/9/12:


§
  
111278 v. 2
. 
Establishing the Art and Design Ed. SUD - 1111 Eighth Street. Supe. Cohen
.
 
Ordinance amending the San Francisco Planning Code by adding Section 249.67 and amending Section Map SU08 of the Zoning Map to: 1) establish the Art and Design Educational Special Use District at 1111 Eighth Street to facilitate the continued operation of the California College of the Arts and provide a regulatory scheme for a potential future phased expansion of the campus.
 
(Banales)


§
  
120882 v. 2. Administrative Code - Board of Supervisors Review of Affordable Housing Trust Fund Supe. Chiu.
 Ordinance amending the San Francisco Administrative Code by adding Section 1.60 to require the Mayor's Office of Housing and the Planning Department to report to the Board of Supervisors every five years on the implementation of Charter Section 16.110, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund Charter Amendment.  (Haddadan)  


§
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
  
120996.  Planning Code - Efficiency Dwelling Units - Numerical Cap and Open/Common Space Requirements.
 
Supe. Wiener. 
Ordinance amending the San Francisco Planning Code by: 1) adding Section 318 to put a cap on the number of Efficiency Dwelling Units, as defined in the Building Code, that can be constructed with reduced square footage unless the units are group housing, affordable housing, or student housing; 2) amending Section 135(d) and adding Section 135.4 to impose open space and common space requirements on Efficiency Dwelling Units with reduced square footage. (Hayward)


 


This week:


§
  
1201019Ordinance amending the San Francisco Administrative Code Chapter 31 to revise our local implementation of CEQA and to update and clarify certain procedures provided for in Chapter 31.
 Under Supervisor Wiener’s legislation, the CEQA appeal period would be triggered by the first project approval, as opposed to the last project approval, which is the case currently. Citizens would still have the right to appeal all CEQA decision, but they would have to do so in a timely manner and not months or years after the decision.  San Francisco’s current Administrative Code provides that the appeal period has to be within 15 to 30 days of the last project approval, even if the CEQA decision occurred months or years before. Thus, if a project requires multiple project approvals – for example, several different building permits, a curb cut permit, and an encroachment permit – a CEQA appeal can be filed after the very last approval, even if that occurs years after the CEQA determination was issued. The legislation would also increase requirements for public noticing of CEQA determinations, so that members of the public know when a CEQA determination has been made. This change will improve public transparency around CEQA decisions.30-day hold expires 11/16.


§
  
120902 Zoning Map & 120901 Planning Code v2 Upper Mkt Rezooning.


 




There may be additional items.  Since the Commission hearings now start at noon, I am unable to see the full list of new legislation introduced as the Clerk finalizes the list after this report.
 






 




 


BOARD OF APPEALS:


The Board met last night and took action on one item that may be of interest to the Planning Commission: 
2705 Larkin Street
 – The subject building permit application proposes an approximately 21’ horizontal extension at the rear of the subject building.  The Planning Commission heard 5 DR requests for the subject permit on May 3, 2012.  At this hearing, the DR requestors expressed concern about privacy, light/air and compliance of the project with building code requirements.  The Planning Commission unanimously approved the permit (6-0-1).  The appeal before the Board of Appeals focused on building code issues primarily related to exiting.  The Board found that the project complied with the Building Code and unanimously upheld the permit.


 


HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:


The HPC confirmed its final recommendation for the Twin Peaks Tavern at 401 Castro Street as a local landmark relative to Article 10 of the Planning Code. As you remember in the previous report to you, it is being considered for landmark designation because of its association with LGBT history. The proposed designation will be scheduled for the Board of Supervisors hearing sometime in the near future and we'll keep you abreast of that hearing date as well as we will forward a copy of the final designation report to you once the Board of Supervisors takes action. The Rec Park Department also presented an overview to the Historic Preservation Commission on the proposed rehabilitation and mural conservation project for Coit Tower. This project will require a Certificate of Appropriateness by the HPC at a future date, but the hearing yesterday was just for informational purposes to get the Commission up to speed on the overall project. As the HPC or I'm sorry, as the Planning Department staff and Rec Park prepare for hearing, the HPC did direct staff to address a few concerns that were raised by public testimony at yesterday's hearing. One was in regards to extra security to protect the murals such as a full-time security guard or the installation of railings or other protective measures to protect the murals from visitors to the tower. The HPC also asked for clarification and a priority plan on the extensive list of recommendations that have been prepared by the preservation consultant. Our understanding is that there is over 100 recommendations within the report to ensure for the long-term protection and enjoyment of Coit Tower to visitors and the neighborhood alike. So the HPC has asked for the Rec Park to prioritize those recommendations to get a better understanding of how this project and the rehabilitation of the tower will be addressed in the future.

TRANSIT CENTER DISTRICT PLAN
 - 
Program Implementation Document 
On May 24, 2012, in approving the Transit Center District Plan, the Planning Commission approved Resolution No. 18635 approving a Program Implementation Document for the Plan Area.
 The Implementation Document contains the Plan Funding Program, which contains an inventory of public improvements to be funded by project Plan revenues, including Plan impact fees, as well as a proportionate allocation of said revenues to various specific improvements as well as categories of improvements. The Implementation Document does not express priorities for funding of particular improvements based on the timing of incoming revenues. The proposed Draft Resolution would amend the Plan Implementation Document to incorporate a statement that park improvements in Chinatown be prioritized for early investment from the Plan’s initial projected Open Space Impact Fee revenues.


Preliminary Recommendation: Adopt the Draft Resolution Amending the Implementation Document


 


SPEAKERS:     None


ACTION:            Approved with directions to staff to work with the City Attorney’s Office on refining some of the language
