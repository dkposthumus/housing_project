COMMISSIONERS’ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
 


 


2.         Commission Comments/Questions


·
         
Inquiries/Announcements
.  Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).


·
         
Future Meetings/Agendas
.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.


 


Commissioner Antonini:


First I congratulate the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants for winning their respective divisions and it may be too early to start talking about Bay Bridge or BART series; it would be a thrill. I am thrilled that the Oakland A's, in record-breaking style, came from 13 games back to win the division. I hope it will keep their team in Oakland forever. The Oakland A's have won four World Series while the San Francisco Giants to date have only won one. They may need to have a new facility, perhaps baseball only most teams have that in the country. Perhaps that is something that can be worked out between the Oakland A's and the City of Oakland. 


A personal note, despite the fact that I have rather bright pink clothing, I am happy to announce that my son and daughter-in-law are expecting a boy in March; my granddaughter will have a little brother. Finally, more importantly, I did meet with the project sponsor a couple of weeks ago in regards to 2830 Toledo, I did have a chance to look at the plans and I'm happy to work with the DR Requestor and Project Sponsor to forge a compromise that will make it something that the Commission can evaluate and find compromise. This will come back in November. I think there's a lot of potential there. 


Commissioner Wu:


I want to announce that this Saturday is affordable housing day in San Francisco. There will be a number of tours: affordable, seniors, partnership between AIA and a number of affordable housing developers. Anyone that wants to stop by, please feel free to do so. 


 


C.         
DIRECTOR’S REPORT


 


3.         Director’s Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


A couple of quick announcements: we sent electronically the current status of the Japantown planning effort. We are happy to answer questions and schedule an upcoming hearing in the next few weeks. And similarly, just as a heads-up, you will hear a couple of informational hearings on Western SOMA. The Department has taken over the planning effort after Paul Lord’s retirement. I want to remind everyone that Columbus Day holiday is Monday so the offices will be closed. I will be out of town Monday and Tuesday as well will be but back on Wednesday.


 


4.         Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.


 


L
AND USE COMMITTEE: 


·
         
An ordinance that would provide a 
5’ height bonus for active uses in the Castro NCD and 24
th
 Noe NCD 
was heard in committee.  This commission unanimously recommended approval the last week.  This week the LU Committee moved the item to the Board with a recommendation of approval.


·
         
The LU Committee heard an ordinance that would amend the Administrative Code.  This legislation strengthens an existing law that was intended to restrict the conversion of apartment units to tourist or short-term use, a practice commonly known as hotelization.  The sponsor, Board President Chiu, described that the legislation clarifies that corporate entities cannot skirt our laws by signing long term leases of residential apartments for planned occupancies of less than 30 days. It also strengthens the enforcement process by creating an administrative review hearing for the Department of Building Inspection to evaluate complaints and by giving our residents the ability to seek legal recourse through the assistance of non-profit organizations.  
This item was also forwarded with a recommendation of approval.


·
         
The Housing Production and Reports Ordinance 
was heard at the Land Use Committee this week. This Ordinance was before you on June 28 and approved with modifications. Supervisor Olague adopted most all the modifications recommended by this Commission and worked closely with staff and the Planning Director to make some minor changes. At the Committee, Supervisor Weiner had some concerns about that the Housing Summary Report would depict a skewed view of housing production trend. Specifically, he was concerned that residential projects affordable to households with 120% AMI and above were lumped into one category; that other forms of housing such as collaborative housing, smaller units, and senior housing might also help to meet the city’s housing needs—and these were not being monitored. He also was concerned that the housing summary report does not provide information on housing production based on unit type or size. Overall, he was concerned that this report will be used to slow down approval of market-rate residential projects. Sponsoring Supervisor Olague stated the goal is not metering of market-rate housing but rather that the focus was on lower income levels due to our inability to meet RHNA goals and the policy imperatives in the General Plan.  Upon questions, department staff that the reason that the highest income category tracked is  120% or is first to reflect RHNA’s categories and second is because we generally don’t have access to household incomes that would be served by residential projects. 
This item was amended to reflect the final changes requested by the Commission and was then moved to the board with a 2-1 vote at the Land Use Committee.


·
         
Lastly another Ordinance that would amend the Administrative Code to ensure the “
Right to Return to Revitalized Public Housing
” also sponsored by Supervisor Olague was heard.  The Planning Commission heard this item last Thursday—at that time the Supervisor was still working with MOH and SFHA on changes so this commission recommended approval of the “return policy” but did not take a position on the details which were in flux.  At this week’s committee hearing the SFHA and MOH also again spoke and the Supervisor made amendments.  Supervisors Cohen and Mar then requested to be cosponsors and recommended approval to the Full Board.


 




                                                          




FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: 




Supervisor Farrell’s Ordinance to
 Reinstate Liquor License Controls and CU for limited restaurants on Union Street
 was also before the Committee.  The Commission recommended approval of this Ordinance with a minor technical amendment on September 9.  
The Ordinance had been amended and this week the Full Board approved the Ordinance on Final Reading.
 


Successor Agency to the Former Redevelopment Agency.  
As reported to you last week, this Ordinance is the result of a recent amendment to State Law AB 1484. The Director provided you with a update last week as this item was before the Board for first reading.  This week the Ordinance was approved on final reading and you will get an in-depth presentation from Tiffany Bohee, the Director of the Successor Agency and Jason Elliott, Director of Legislation for the Mayor in a few moments as part of today’s Director’s Report.
 


TIDF.  
The Planning Commission heard the TIDF Update ordinance on July 19, 2012 The Planning Commission recommended approval of the ordinance with modifications
[1]
.  The Mayor introduced substitute legislation included all of your recommendations.  
This week the Full Board continued the Ordinance to October 16. 


The Update to the Community Safety Element of the General Plan was heard at committee this week.  The Commission recommended approval of this on June 14, 2012. 
This week the Board approved the ordinance on First Reading.
 


An Ordinance sponsored by the Mayor, Board President Chiu, and Supervisors Kim and Wiener was also heard at committee.  This Ordinance would 
change the threshold for the Inclusionary Affordable Housing program
 from buildings with 5 or more units to those with 10 or more.  This Commission recommended approval of the Ordinance on June 16th.  This Ordinance is the “companion” legislation to the Housing Trust Fund and would only become effective if the voters approve the HTF in this November’s election
[2]
. Further, as this was amended by the Board last week, the City would be able to monitor the effect on housing production of this change and could decide to reinstate this fee at a later date if desired. 
With these amendments, the Ordinance was recommended for approval by the Board.
 






4pm Appeal.  
There had been an appeal filed on a Conditional Use Authorization at 175 Junipero Serra Boulevard.  This CU would allow a childcare facility for 15 or more children.  At this week’s hearing, the president indicated he had received a letter from the appellant withdrawing the appeal.  There were no speakers and the hearing was closed with you CU approval intact.




 


 


INTRODUCTIONS:  No known planning /land use ordinances.


 


BOARD OF APPEALS:

No meeting


 


HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:


The Commission heard public testimony and discussed with staff the Mayor's Office of Economic and Workforce Development's decision not to fund the request by the Mission Dolores Neighborhood Association, not to develop a Mission Dolores National Registration. The Mayor raised two issues: 1) Funding the level of outreach; 2), concerns raised by the Planning Department when the Neighborhood Association surveyed the neighborhood a couple of years ago. The Department specifically had questions about integrity and the boundary justification. Like I said, after public testimony and discussing with staff, the HPC wrote a letter to the funding committee. There is a project that could be funded that could 1) expand the level of community outreach which we are happy to provide assistance with, and 2) would be to expand the methodology - raised from concerns by the Planning Department staff; and we will work with Historic Preservation Commission to outline those items that should be included in that methodology for when the nomination is completed. We are reviewing it as part of the local government responsibilities. The second item at the HPC is a confirmation of the nomination of the building located in the Sunset District. In my last report the building was occupied by Henry Dolger for over 40 years; significant not only by the association with Mr. Dolger but also by the deco design. HPC unanimously approved a nomination. It is scheduled for a final vote by the Board of Supervisors sometimes before the end of this year.
