Commissioner Antonini
:  


Increased housing prices is the subject of an article in today's Business Section of the paper.  The article talks about various cities in the United States, and one of them is San Francisco, which never had a huge fall in prices, but did have some areas that were challenged. There was conjecture in the article as to why this happened. One thing that was mentioned was cities where there are a large number of upper income households with better incomes during the recovery. It mentioned that fewer than 11,400 professional service sector jobs were reported recently in San Francisco, and that is an increase of 2,400 from last year. To give you a perspective on why this is important in the downtown areas, the lack of jobs to attract people, for example, I think San Diego and Charlotte, the figures I have show only 45,000 jobs in the downtown area. Those jobs are not there, and they are sometimes attractive to people to live in downtown areas. They're facing a long commute in the same area. The jobs would have to come first. There is certainly nothing wrong when we are building housing to note that large numbers of housing, the market rate housing is above the 20 percent, because if someone buys them or fix them and adds the tax revenue and moves new citizens into San Francisco to create jobs for our citizens and our work force here -- I think that is an important thing to look at if we consider this. A lot of cities would love to have this problem. They have been trying to do some things in Phoenix to create a downtown. Even though they have a lot of projects there, the large concentration of residents in the downtown area, student housing connected with the branch of the university and other cities cannot attract retail, even in some of the glamorous city's, the people want to be here is very beneficial and we should keep that in mind as we talk about other subjects later in our calendar. 


Commissioner Miguel
: 


I had a few meetings this week on items on today's calendar. One regarding the project at Parcel P, the Old Central Freeway Parcels, Natoma, and 14
th
 Street, I went to a meeting with the MTA. This one was out in the Richmond. In my mind, it was a lot of fluff with no new information, and of course, no estimation whatsoever as to when and if that would come to pass. It was the same solution for the Presidio Intersection and Fillmore intersection. So, one very interesting meeting was the Civic Design Review. We have seen that in the paper this week, the design for the new control tower. It's interesting, because you could really call it a beginning. What was even more interesting was the information from the FAA, who could deal with the top of it. Not just the staffing. They designed the top and they tell the architects to figure out some way to get it up there. The angles; the sidelines to where they have to go; the tilt of it – It was a very interesting experience for me, and of course, taking a look at the rest of it, which, truthfully, I think we will have a major piece of architecture sitting out there. It is very interesting. A very tight geographic relationship between terminals 1 and 2, they had one where the people had not been through security. I think once it is going, you will be very pleased with it.

5.         Director’s Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


In light of the hearing last week, we would like to schedule some more detailed briefings on the background information on the plan. We are happy to do that in public hearings or individually with you as well, to talk about that. 


The second thing, with respect to our budget, the Committee met to approve our budget this week. There are still some points of [dis]agreements, if you will. They have chosen to wait until this afternoon when they will be voting on the entire budget, our department budget. The issue is a couple of positions and whether they should forward or not. I will say, in spite of what has come up, most of the changes to our budget were accepted by the Committee. So, we are having discussions with members of that committee all week long.

Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.


 


LAND USE COMMITTEE: no Monday hearing.  




CPMC:
 This past Monday, 6/25/12, there was a hearing at the Land Use Committee on CPMC’s Long Range Development Plan Project. The hearing was the second of four at the Land Use Committee, which will be followed by two hearings at the full Board. Monday’s hearing focused on a discussion about the healthcare provisions of the Development Agreement.
 
President Chiu, and Supervisor Campos, joined the Committee for portions of the more than 5-hour long hearing. During the staff presentation, staff from OEWD informed the Committee and the public that one key provision of the DA was being re-negotiated based on some new information that CPMC provided to the City, which made one of the previous commitments no longer satisfactory to the City. Specifically, this provision deals with the metric used to allow CPMC to close St. Luke’s Hospital.
 




 


If you recall, the commitment in the DA was for CPMC to keep St. Luke’s open for a 20 year term. That provision has not changed. However, there was also metric that would allow CPMC to close St. Luke’s if the SF CPMC system -– were effectively in “dire financial straits”. During the initial negotiation, “dire financial straits” meant that CPMC would have to be operating below a 1% margin for two consecutive years. This 1% metric was 
significantly
 below any projections they had at the time, and would also trigger a drop to their Moody’s credit rating. Based on input from an independent third party, City staff believed that this 1% operating margin was a highly unlikely reality for CPMC in the coming years. 


 


Based on some new, more conservative projections about revenues, CPMC’s projected operating margin in the coming years is now lower than previously projected, and although it does not reach the 1% threshold, it does not provide the City with the same level of comfort in representing a highly unlikely scenario for CPMC. The City wants to make sure that if there is any “out clause” in the continued operation of St. Luke’s, it is one that is unlikely to be met, since the continued operation of St. Luke’s for 20 years is one of, if not 
the,
 most important provision of the Development Agreement. 


OEWD staff noted that this information was only recently provided to the City, and the goal had been to come to the hearing on Monday with a solution, not just the problem. Although this did not happen, OEWD staff is hopeful to have a new solution to this provision of the Development Agreement soon, understanding that the Development Agreement will not move forward until there is consensus on a new agreement for this provision.


This new information was the focus of the Supervisors’ questions. President Chiu and Supervisor Campos were particularly upset that they had not been informed as soon as this information was provided to OEWD staff. OEWD staff concluded the presentation reaffirming the goal of having an “iron-clad” agreement, and acknowledging that this agreement won’t move forward without an iron clad agreement on the provision of St. Luke’s continued operation. 


The next land use hearing is scheduled for July 9
th
, and will focus on transportation and public realm, the City’s Health Service System, and the Controller and Budget Analyst’s Reports. It is expected that the Land Use Committee will forward the items to the full Board without recommendation, since there is a pending appeal of the FEIR. 


One July 17
th
, the full Board will hear the FEIR appeal along with the first reading of the proposed Ordinances.

At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.

(1)  responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or


(2)  requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or
