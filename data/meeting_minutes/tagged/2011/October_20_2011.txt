Commissioner Antonini
:  


To the comments on housing issues: you’ve probably seen a lot in the press about repossessions and there was a big article in The Chronicle. I think the City is doing a very good job regarding some of the protests that are taking place as far as the Occupy Now and still protecting free speech rights by also protecting the rights of the vast majority of the public that also has the right to use public space that other people are occupying.  I hope that the same things are being applied, that you don't block passage ways, that you have permits, that there are no encampments or cooking. This is what is being done, just as if you're using a baseball field in Golden Gate Park for part of the day.  When your usage is over, you have to vacate so someone else can use it. On the larger issue of some of the causes I have not heard much discussion about remedies from any of the people who are protesting. I think a lot of the factors that exist in this situation are similar to what happened in the late 20's. A lot of it, in both instances gambling on appreciation. In the late 20's, people were buying stocks with the idea that the increase in stock prices would allow them to make a lot of money. When stock prices fell, they lost much of their income because they had gambled on stock appreciation and the situation that is occurring most recently was doing the same thing with real estate. I think we need some positive steps in this direction, particularly with owner occupied home mortgages. We need a more conservative appraisals, I like to see an end of the loan payments and in variable mortgages, and probably mandatory mortgage insurance. This would prevent the kind of thing that has happened in the past from happening again. There are a lot of people that should take the blame and obviously, it has been talked about a lot. While banks and Wall Street had a lot to do with that, the folks that borrowed either ill-advised or made bad choices and even the Government that funded a lot of these bad loans through government agencies with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or other agencies, it was partly because of this. Hopefully out of this entire thing will come with some solutions on a Federal basis that we can apply to this unfortunate situation and not have that happen again.


Commissioner Miguel
:


During the past week I have had some conversations regarding America's Cup. Last night, there was an excellent reception for the 10th anniversary of City Car Share that was well attended. The main speaker was Nancy Pelosi, who from the beginning has been a very heavy supporter and a proponent of this concept particularly here in San Francisco. There were three meetings this week at which members of the Planning staff really shined. One was on the implementation of the Eastern Neighborhoods.  They did a wonderful presentation on that. It was excellent for the Department.  There was the monthly meeting of the Market Street Civic Design Group and I have to compliment David Alumbaugh who has been doing excellent work on this somewhat large committee of people who are sometimes very independent and no way that they worked professionally, but have been getting along beautifully in the meeting is and really producing a lot of good work up till now.  And there was a public meeting of the Arts Funding Legislation that Supervisor Chiu has put forth a public meeting. It was fortunate that the Arts Community was very well represented. The development community that also was affected by this was totally absent. I am not sure, and I've talked with those from the Art Commission as well, and additional work will be done to get the development community at least to acknowledge that there is something possibly happening with this. In particular, an old friend of mine that was President of the Black Rock Foundation was there and did an excellent job of explaining what funding for the arts community can do for the civic realm. He really did an excellent job of that.  It was an interesting week.


Commissioner Borden:


I wanted to thank my colleagues for indulging me earlier. As many of you might know, this is the Great California Shakeout where we raise awareness about earthquake preparedness and at 

around 10:20 A.M., people were told to drop, cover and hold on because that is what you need to do in an earthquake.  [You should get] underneath the surface like this desk or under a door frame would be a great way to keep yourself safe. We can't emphasize enough how important it is to be prepared, or how important earthquake preparedness is.  22 years ago Monday was another earthquake – we all need to make a plan and be prepared. The second thing is I went along the two blocks of Sixth Street on Friday night.  It was just an incredible opportunity to see what was going on along that area of Sixth Street. All the different businesses; you had a band playing in the Laundromat, you had people drawing on the walls, it was an amazing display of art. It was pretty spectacular. It was a longtime studio in the Filipino Community, and with the help of the Redevelopment Agency after being pushed out, they were able to be in a position to have a brand new studio come on line and it was an amazing evening to see what is starting to happen along Sixth Street. If you haven't been on Sixth Street, patronize the businesses.  The vacancy rate is under 10%. That is because there was a lot of hard work on solutions to help fill those facades. What they need is for all of us to go and patronize the businesses and support them. 


Commissioner Moore: 


Congratulations to the Planning Department on October 26 at 3:00 p.m., the Public Advisory Committee will give a demonstration on the new permit process and permit tracking system which will tie those departments closer together. This particular meeting will be held in Room 2001, and I assume that the public will be interested in how this becomes a more effective tool for all of us. There are some people that might want to see what that entails. For many years, we have been encouraging and supporting the Department for the length that I have been sitting up here, a little more than five years. I am looking forward for a much clearer and streamlined operation that provides timely information and provides recourse. 


Commissioner Sugaya
:  


Last week, I had occasion to go by the Piazza Market again.  And since the last time this issue came before us, I think it has gone totally in the other direction. I think they were modest before in that they needed to comply with the original conditional use that was supposed to be for a market. Now there is not one stick of grocery at that place at this moment whereas before, there was the pretense of it being a market and they had some shelving. Now the place looks like a wine bar. The entire center space is nothing but tables and chairs. I think we need to take another look at this. Also following the market, I walked down Columbus and there is a parklet. I don't know how the enforcement works, but it is obvious that this parklet is just an extension of the restaurant. They're serving people, taking orders, what ever. I don't think that was the intent and I don't want them to turn it into a mere extension of a private enterprise within the public realm. If that is going to continue to happen, we should start charging them rent. That is all I have at the moment.


Commissioner Miguel:
 


That is happening all over the City. It is very obvious. It is my understanding they are not allowed to take orders, not allowed to actually bring food to the table. It is happening all over the City. The Academy of Art is occupying 625 Polk Street, a historic building, I believe, a landmark. And I am not saying they shouldn't have, for public safety, but they have put safety lights on the exterior all around that building. And are making changes to the exterior of the historic building. I presume this should take quite a bit of procedure. I question whether it has been followed in this case, and I would like someone to take a look at it. 


Commissioner Antonini:


I also have had meetings in the last week or two with the Project Sponsor and Architect for 1800 Van Ness Avenue, which is on today' s calendar and with both neighbors of Nob Hill and representatives of Live Nation in regards to concerns of a future project --  it will be coming back to us.


Commissioner Moore:


 I would like to ask that this Commission have a presentation by the Department relative to where we encourage and support parklets. I assume it is part of a larger comprehensive planning department idea rather than what can potentially be of use to a particular location.  As you will recall from the issue last week, putting it on California Street on a project that for other reasons I did not support, it was not part of a comprehensive idea.  I am interested to hear you constructively speak to the larger ideas of how we believe parklets can help a street become more neighborly. We want to support them, and we are not. In addition to, if they become potentially the tool for mitigating other impacts, do we have a fund for money being collected so we can build them where we want them? Are they only occurring where somebody suggests they should be? I would very much like to hear a more comprehensive presentation by the Department.


 


D.         DIRECTOR’S REPORT


 


6.
                   
Director’s Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


With respect to parklets, we can do that presentation. We allow people to take food and we encourage them to be near eating and drinking establishments just because of the nature of what most of them, not all of them, are about. The agreement is that we should not be -- we can take them from across the way or another location. I realize that there are some concerns about some of them in the way they are operating. The other thing I wanted to call attention to the Commission is that the Commission has had several questions about the approval process for America's Cup, there is a memo to you outlining all of that, and it would be helpful for the public to hear that certification of the environmental impact report is currently scheduled for December, tentatively. There are other actions required at the Port Commission as well as the Board of Supervisors. Beyond that, there are 12 other City Regional, State and Federal 

agencies that have approval actions. All of the other actions including the Board of Supervisors are dependent on your certification. That has to happen before any other approving actions can be taken. I wanted to clarify that for Commission and the public.

Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.


 


LAND USE COMMITTEE:


Alcoholic Beverages in Bowling Alleys in the Mission Alcoholic Beverage Special Use Subdistrict
 introduced by Supervisor Kim
.
  The Planning Commission had unanimously passed a resolution at its September 22, 2011 hearing recommending that the Board of Supervisors adopt the proposed Ordinance, with two modifications:


•
          
to include an additional exception for single-screen movie theaters, allowing these theaters to serve beer and wine.  


•
          
to refer to Planning Code Section 249.60, which is where in the Code the Mission Alcoholic Beverage SUD is now referenced.


•
          
Supervisor Kim did express her intent to amend the Ordinance to include the both of the two recommendations of the Planning Commission.  The full committee was supportive.  Because the amendment had not yet been drafted, the Land Use Committee will hear the item again, with the amendments, before forwarding the ordinance to the full Board. At the hearing, Supervisor Wiener expressed his desire to open up a broader discussion about the SUD in order to review the controls and how they can be updated to achieve the goals of original Ordinance and still encourage active uses in the district.
 


 


FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:


§
         
Acts of God and Calamity Ordinance.  
At the July 14th, hearing, the PC voted 7-0 to recommend that the Board of Supervisors (herinafter “The Board”) adopt the Ordinance with modifications.  Specifically, the PC recommended the Ordinance  be modified in two ways.  First, it should allow a reasonable degree of flexibility for those who have experienced a calamity but not to be overly permissive in allowing rebuild of nonconforming uses.  Second, the Ordinance should be modified to include the retroactive date of retroactive operative date of August 1, 2009. Since the PC hearing, staff has recognized that the recommendation should have been applied not only to Section 181 Non-Conforming Uses but also mirroring changes should have been recommended to Section 188 Non-Conforming Structures. Both Sections have the exact same problematic and vague existing language.  
This week the Full Board continued the item. 


§
         
3151-3155 Scott Street
 SUD.  
The project, renovation and conversation of an existing Marina District tourist hotel to group housing for transitional-age foster care youth, prompted an outpouring of impassioned testimony about the merits of the project from both sides of the aisle. Early this month the project had withstood both a CEQA appeal and a CU appeal before voting to adopt the associated Special Use District by a 9-1 vote.   
This week the Board again passed the SUD by the same vote on final reading.

BOARD OF APPEALS:


The Board of Appeals did not meet last night, there will be meeting next week and would like you to know that they only have four hearings left between now and the end of the year. They cancel the hearing for November 2
nd
, due to lack of interest. There have been fewer appeals filed. They are at about half the number that they would usually get filed. This is not to say that permits are absolutely down.


HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:


The Historic Preservation Commission did meet yesterday and there are just a couple of items: 1) the Glen Park Historic Resources Survey was adopted, and without a lot of discussion, 2) Articles 10 and 11: they have actually taken actions to adopt the modifications to Article 10 with the modifications that the City Attorney introduced and/or that they themselves amended.  They have not completed their review of Article 11.  That will be continued to their next hearing that will be after your meeting on the 27
th
. The Commission President himself and other members of HPC (Richard Johns and Alan Martinez) will attend your meeting on the 27
th
 to engage you and let you know their positions and why they took the actions they took, and where they are on Article 11. 49 Julian is a conditional use item that is coming before you in a few weeks and the President of this Commission, President Olague, requested that HPC review it because of its location to the Armory. Their belief is that the project should move forward. They do have concerns that the building will shade the drill area of the Armory. They are not so much interested in reducing the height of the project as they are interested in maybe having a further setback to that side of the project, away from the Armory to allow more light – and from what Commissioner Martinez has proposed, also maybe a re-look at the roofline as it overhangs that area.  With that, they urge that the project move forward.
