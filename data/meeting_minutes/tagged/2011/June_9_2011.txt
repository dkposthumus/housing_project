Inquiries/Announcements
.  
Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or 
inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).




·
        


Future Meetings/Agendas
.  
At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a 
Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda 
of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.




 




Commissioner Olague
:





I wanted to mention at 
this time that we will close the meeting in honor of the two [San Francisco] 
firemen who lost their lives: Anthony Valerio and Vincent Perez. 




Commissioner Antonini
: 
 I was absent last week on a family vacation to Hawaii, and aside from the usual 
golf and beach activities, I did spend a couple of days touring Honolulu.  I was 
pretty impressed with the changes since I had been there. It had been quite a 
while.

Like a lot of other cities I see, I think it is instructive that it was 
noticeably clean. There's not a lot of trash on the ground, and as you know, 
they have a lot of wind there, too, so I do not think we could blame that.  Not 
much graffiti was visible. I went through many parts of the City. The other 
thing they do that I think is pretty successful -- I' m not exactly sure how it 
works -- but parks are closed between 11:00 P.M., and 6:00A.M., so while people 
can occupy the parks for as long as they want during the other hours, when that 
time comes, those who are there are asked to leave except for passageways on 
sidewalks going through. They say it has been quite successful. I'm not sure how 
they do that, but it sounds like something we might want to look into.  We also 
are a site for much tourism, and I think it's certainly made a difference in 
what you see in Honolulu, or at least the parks I was in, and that was the 
downtown area; also, in what you see in terms of the negative items. We can 
always take lessons from other places. Unfortunately I also -- or fortunately, I 
did take a wonderful tour of Pearl Harbor, including the USS Missouri, which 
could have been in San Francisco and probably would have been, but 
unfortunately, there was a lot of opposition, and now, it is in Pearl Harbor.





Commissioner Miguel:




I had the pleasure Tuesday 
evening of being at the Green Room of the War Memorial Building and saw the 
three finalist models for the War Memorial .They are very interesting. The Arts 
Commission is leading the design. The selection on this was very well attended, 
and the plaza itself will be in honor of George and Charles Schulz who were 
present.  Everyone has their favorites, but I think any of them would do the 
City proud. 





Commissioner Sugaya:
 
  I see on the advanced calendar that there might be an informational 
presentation on the Academy of Art University coming up. 





Director Rahaim
:




I think we concluded this 
week in discussions that we would defer that. Commissioner Olague requested to 
have a closed session on this.




 





Commissioner Sugaya:




I was just thinking they 
either have purchased or are in negotiation for purchase of the Cannery, I 
believe it is. I would be in support of a closed hearing before we move forward 
in a public hearing. 





Commissioner Moore
:




I have been meeting with 
the Department of Information Technology. I realize there are strong ties for 
planning as a user group to information technology with many exciting projects. 
At some point, it might be interesting to have someone else from the Department 
-- to have these people talk to us about the planning challenges; and about what 
planning does and has successfully done by establishing a powerful web site. 
This is a treasure trove of wealth these people have from an idea point.  It is 
quite exciting to listen to them, particularly as the City faces the challenge 
of the America's cup.  And while they are brainstorming with the next layer, it 
might well serve us and be very fun to listen to some of their ideas.  So if we 
can kind of have a tentative date, or have it on our things to do calendar, that 
would be a good idea.





Commissioner Borden: 




I know that members of the 
public already know this, but I will not be here next Thursday, and the reason 
is because it is the 100
th
 Anniversary of IBM, the company for which 
I work.

They have been in San Francisco since 1914.  We have been in San Francisco for 
almost as long as we have been around as a company. On the 15
th
, the 
day before, our company is having a global day of service, so employees around 
the world, are going to be volunteering.  And here in San Francisco we will be 
installing solar panels around homes in the Bayview Hunters Point.  We will also 
be working at St. Anthony's clinic, working with patients there through a 
community health center initiative we are working on. People are also being 
trained with the Red Cross, and others will be volunteering in Oakland Public 
Schools.  So it is exciting because we have a lot of fun things going on around 
the globe where our company has had a challenge. We are challenging everyone to 
pledge eight hours of service in the year 2011.




Commissioner Sugaya
:





Speaking of IT, and IBM, I 
am trying to connect these things with lack of information at the moment. It 
seems that Salesforce has done a pretty nice job in their architectural work 
with respect to their campus on Mission Bay. One of the comments I noted in the 
paper was that they seem to have opened up the campus to the public with access 
ways and open space areas. That kind of attitude seems to me to be very good for 
San Francisco. When companies take that attitude, I noted in the paper there is 
a proposal from Apple to create a new campus with some kind of circular building 
that seems to be totally the opposite of what Salesforce is doing. Of course, I 
do not have details. There may be penetrations into that, but the circular space 
of the courtyard in between does not seem to be as penetrable as the Salesforce 
campus. Some clips from Mr. Jobs also indicate that he may not be quite as 
attuned to what Apple may do for Cupertino as Salesforce seems to be doing for 
San Francisco. He basically said if they could not build it here, we would just 
go somewhere else.  But he was quoted as saying something to the Council that if 
they were not going to approve it, they could just go to Mountain View or 
somewhere else. Also, some Council person asked him about contributing to the 
City's Wi-Fi network, and he said that is why they pay taxes.




Commissioner Miguel
:




Just a tag on to what 
Commissioner Sugaya mentioned. I mentioned last week seeing the model of 
Salesforce's 14-acre campus proposal. Not only is it completely open, it brings 
16
th
 Street all the way into it, but unlike Google and many of the 
others, there is no in-house food service, no cafeteria, no restaurant, no 
nothing. They are bringing in private enterprises who will be given or leased, 
probably, spaces along the plaza and everything in order to activate and service 
the general public as well. It is the first major firm of that kind that is 
breaking away from keeping everything in house. I thought that was fantastic.






Commissioner Moore:





Although we' re not allowed to discuss this particular subject, I want to say 
that there are a couple of architects who can deliver a building out of the 
unusual -- out of the usual, and I think that will be good for Mission Bay 
because the building type has become a little bit subdued and boring.




 


C.         DIRECTORâS REPORT




 




4.         
Directorâs Announcements




 





Director Rahaim:





We were informed last week that the Academy of Art did in fact close on The 
Cannery, and you will soon be receiving a letter from me to the Academy 
outlining my concerns about that issue, particularly in light of the fact that 
The Cannery is not within the EIR study areas we have identified in the current 
process. Those study areas were identified over a year ago. So we are quite 
concerned about that in light of the fact that the EIR is what allows them to 
come into compliance. Also regarding the Academy, I want to point out an article 
that I just printed out just before this meeting that was in today' s "Wall 
Street Journalâ which I just had in front of me that is the outline version, but 
certainly available online as well. The second thing I wanted to tell you about 
was that yesterday we released a draft of the Recreation and Open Space Element 
of the General Plan for the public. Those should be in your packets that you 
receive today, and staff will be coming to you on June 23 for initiation of that 
element. The environmental review is almost complete. Just for the purpose of 
information to the public, it is available at the Department, and also online. 
There will be freebies and hardcover copies available for people to review. This 
has been a work in progress for a couple of years between the staff of the 
Recreation and Park Department and several other agencies and public task forces 
as well. That was released as of yesterday in draft form, and I wanted to call 
it to your attention.  I received an e-mail before I came here about some 
reorganization in San Diego on the Planning Department side. They have recently 
taken steps to merge what had been a separate Planning Department responsible 
for Long-Range Planning with their Building Services and Development Department. 
As best I can tell, it is the equivalent of merging planning and DBI in San 
Francisco.  These things are happening in many Cities, and San Diego is one 
where these organizations go back and forth. A few years ago they were one way, 
and then there will be a change, and it will be another way. It is not clear how 
much of their long-range planning function will survive. I know that the 
director of that department was let go as part of this process.  But this is an 
indication of what is happening in some other cities. Several years ago, you may 
recall the City of Cincinnati entirely eliminated their planning department. 
That has since been restarted. Chicago eliminated their Long-Range Planning 
function a few years ago as well. So these things are moving targets somewhat. 
Cities often reorganize these functions in many different ways, but I thought it 
was interesting that San Diego was one, the first California City I have seen in 
a while where it happened. The first large City where I have seen it happen. I 
just thought that was interesting and wanted to bring that to your attention. I 
think that concludes my report.

Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of 
Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.




 





LAND USE COMMITTEE: 




§
 



BF 110658 800 Presidio/Booker T Mixed 
Use Development. 



The Land Use Committee held a hearing on legislation introduced by Supervisors 
Mirkarimi, Mar, and Avalos that would create a special use district related to 
the project that would amend the height limit from 40-x to 50-x.  Commissioners, 
you heard this project on April 28, 2011.  At that hearing there was a great 
deal of discussion about whether the height limit should be 45â or 55â, your 
decision was to approve a 55â project.  
This week the land use committee took 
public comment on the SUD but could not take action due to a pending CEQA 
appeal.  At this time there is both a pending CEQA and CU appeal on this project 
pending before the Full Board which are tentatively scheduled for June 14 and 
28, respectively.




§
 




Bf 110556 Western SoMa Community Stabilization Policy.  



Supervisor Kim is the sponsor of this resolution whereby the Board would urge 
the Planning Commission to incorporate the policy and objectives of the 
Stabilization Policy into the Western SoMa Community Plan when that plan comes 
before you.  This Stabilization Policy would establish a metering of development 
with the goal of achieving the communityâs desired balance of affordable housing 
to market-rate housing and jobs to housing.  As a resolution, the Board does not 
refer these items to the Commission (only Ordinances are required to wait 
90-days for your deliberation).  At this hearing, Department staff expressed 
support for ensuring balanced development.  Staff also expressed concerns about 
a few items of this resolution.  Specifically, that this proposed âmeteringâ may 
bind future Planning Commissions and Board Members preventing them from using 
their discretion to approve potentially beneficial projects.   The Department 
explained that an area of this small size is difficult in that projects just 
outside of the boundary would not be counted but would impact the neighborhood 
nonetheless.  Further the boundaries of Western SoMa were not drawn to reflect a 
self-sustaining urban organism but are a result of political negotiations and 
split thru blocks, zoning districts and streets.  Lastly due to the specific lot 
size needs of affordable housing projects staff requested more time to study the 
issue to ensure that there are enough large parcels to support 30% affordable 
housing.  
The Committee discussed continuing the item to allow time for the 
Director to meet with Western SoMa Stakeholders but the legislative sponsor did 
not consent. The item was forwarded to the Full Board without recommendation.




§
 




BF 101350 Parking in SoMa and Mission Bay.  



The Planning Commission considered this proposed Ordinance sponsored by 
Supervisor Kim on April 28.  The legislation would revise parking, use, and 
street frontage in the Western SoMa area to conform to more contemporary 
policies in San Francisco.  At the hearing, the Commission voted to recommend 
approval with modifications.  At that hearing, you recommended a host of changes 
to ensure that the legislation (originally sponsored by Supervisor Daly) was 
made consistent with legislation which has passed in the past 6 months.  You 
also recommended removing all controls related to Mission Bay.  Supervisor Kim 
incorporated all of your recommendations and made minor technical amendments at 
the Land Use hearing.  
This item was continued for one more and likely final 
hearing at the land use committee as amended.





FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:




§
 




North Beach Library Appeal and Associated Approvals.
  
On April 21, this Commission approved the Library and the associated EIR and 
Zoning Map Ordinance.  This week at the EIR appeal, the appellant failed to 
convince the Board that the EIR was inadequate or that entitlements the Library 
and Rec Park were seeking should not be granted, although entitlements were not 
acted on due to notice issues. Public testimony centered on the legality of 
using the so-called "triangle" parcel at the corner of Columbus, Mason, and 
Lombard Streets as the site of the new library, rather than as open space, which 
appellants argued was not in keeping with the acquisition of the property by 
eminent domain. Also, appellants argued that the EIR wrongly characterized the 
triangle parcel as a parking use, based on it's current use, rather than as open 
space. 
The Board, by a unanimous vote, upheld the Planning Commission's 
unanimous certification of the Final EIR and denied the EIR appeal.  The Board 
went on to approve the street vacation and zoning map amendment for the project 
on first reading, except for the Ordinance that would authorize the use of 701 
Lombard as a playground and library due to noticing issues.  This sole item was 
continued to June 28 to allow for public notice.  




§
 




Treasure Island Appeal and Approvals.  



This project had the usual complications for reuse of former military facilities 
plus a remote mid-Bay location.  Further complicating matters late in the 
process were uncertainties about the future of redevelopment agencies and a 
decision to switch the governance and financing to not include redevelopment.  
The EIR Appellants included the Sierra Club, Arc Ecology, former Supervisor 
Aaron Peskin, and others.  There was considerable uncertainty going into and 
during the appeal hearing whether or not appellants' arguments against the EIR 
and the project were getting traction with various members of the Board and a 
five-hour appeal hearing ensured.  Opponents raised concerns about hazardous 
materials, sea level rise, tsunamis, visual effects, transportation, historic 
resources, and other issues which were thoroughly addressed in the EIR.  Based 
on recent changes to how the project would be implemented, which includes a much 
greater oversight role for the Planning Department, appellants argued that the 
"unstable" project definition required recirculation of the EIR, contested the 
legitimacy of Land Use Committee hearings, and essentially argued for starting 
the whole process over again. 
At this weekâs hearing the EIR for Treasure 
Island was upheld.  Regarding the associated approvals, Supervisor Mar 
introduced an amendment (which was approved 7-4) related to Historic 
preservation.  The Design for Development was amended to require TIDA to follow 
the Standards of the Secretary of the Interior and to consult with Historic 
Preservation experts at the Planning Department regarding any development 
involving historic resources.  After this staff review, the Dept could bring the 
matter to the HPC for input if desired. (Previously, TIDA just needed to consult 
"an expert," not necessarily at Planning and there was previously no mention of 
the HPC). All the other minor amendments were approved unanimously. This 
amendment was considered separately from the other items and received a the 
split vote due to the explicit codification of the Sec'y of the Interior 
Standards. Supe. Wiener express concern that this would be the first City 
ordinances to mention these standards. (Though the HPC has adopted them as 
policy).  With that all items were passed unanimously on first reading.  






§
 




Parkmerced.  



Lastly, all of the Ordinances related to Parkmerced were passed by the Board on 
second reading and will now be sent to the Mayor for signature.





INTRODUCTIONS:  







	110448 Zoning Map Amendments - Establishing City Center Special Sign 
	District.
  
	Supervisor Farrell introduced an Ordinance that would amending Sections 
	602.10, 607.1, and 608, adding Section 608.16, and amending Sectional Map

CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MEDICAL CENTER (CPMC) LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN
 
â 
This is the third of four scheduled informational hearings that will 
provide an overview of CPMCâs development projects. Specific topics to be 
discussed at this session include a summary of the required entitlements and 
approvals, an overview of the topics contained in the Development Agreement, and 
a response to several questions raised by Commissioners during the May 12, 2011 
hearing.
  California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC) is made up of four 
medical centers in San Francisco, consisting of the California Campus 
(previously known as the Childrenâs Hospital of San Francisco), Pacific Campus 
(previously known as the Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center), Davies Campus 
(previously Ralph K. Davies Hospital), and St. Lukeâs Campus. Three of CPMCâs 
four acute-care hospitals (California, Pacific, and St. Lukeâs Campusâ) must be 
rebuilt or de-licensed in order to comply with state law about the seismic 
stability of hospitals. CPMC proposes to consolidate the acute-care services 
currently located at the California and Pacific Campuses, and locate them at a 
new medical center at Van Ness Avenue and Geary. The Van Ness and Geary Medical 
Center would include a hospital on the west side of Van Ness Avenue ((Block 
0695, Lots 005, 006) and a new Medical Office Building on the east side of Van 
Ness Avenue (Block 0694, Lots 005, 006, 007, 008, 009, 009A, 010). The sites are 
bounded by Franklin Street, Post Street, Van Ness Avenue, Cedar Street, Geary 
Street, and Geary Boulevard.  At the St. Lukeâs Campus, CPMC proposes to 
construct a new hospital that will be located adjacent to the existing hospital 
tower on Cesar Chavez Street (Block 6576, Lot 021). The existing hospital tower 
on St. Lukeâs Campus (Block 6575, Lots 001, 002) would be demolished after the 
new hospital is built, operational, and patients have been transferred. In a 
subsequent phase, a replacement medical office building/expansion building would 
be built at the corner of Cesar Chavez and Valencia Streets. CPMC also proposes 
to reauthorize their previously approved Conditional Use for the Davies 
Neuroscience Institute (aka Noe Street Medical Office Building) located at 601 
Duboce Street (Block 3539, Lot 001).




Preliminary Recommendation: No Action Requested. Informational 
Discussion Only.
