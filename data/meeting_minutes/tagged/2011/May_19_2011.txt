Comments/Questions




·
        


Inquiries/Announcements
.  
Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or 
inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).




·
        

Future 
Meetings/Agendas
.  
At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a 
Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda 
of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.




 




Commissioner Antonini:






I have had a few meetings in the last week with certain 
individuals about various projects coming up. One of them is with neighbors at 
899 Valencia; I believe that is on our calendar for next week.  I also met with 
representatives of 55 Laguna regarding some modifications.  It will be on 
calendar in 2 or 3 weeks.  I also had meetings with representatives of 4436 
Pleasant, as well as with neighbors involved in 1945 Hyde. Those are the 
meetings I had last week.




Commissioner Miguel
:  




Although I was out last week with illness, I did watch the 
entire Commission meeting on TV. I have also had meetings regarding CPMC and 
Chase Bank. I am sure all of the commissioners read the article in the paper 
regarding Walgreens. I referred to them as a grocery store, not a retail 
pharmacy, I would be really interested if I see any official papers come in for 
Walgreens or CVS as a retail pharmacy. I would be very tempted to throw them out 
the window as being inaccurate. 




Commissioner Fong:




I just want to mention that a large event is happening in San 
Francisco next week called Powow.

It does not have anything to do with planning, but it does have a lot to do with 
the future of San Francisco. This brings 5500 international buyers into San 
Francisco. They are folks who bring wholesale buying into the United States. It 
should be good for the City. Everybody who represents San Francisco will have an 
opportunity to be a host member of the City. 




Commissioner Sugaya
: 




To follow-up Commissioner Miguel â the Powell Street and 
Sutter Walgreens are in the process of restocking and re- shelving the back of 
those stores to have food items and full dairy items.




Commissioner Olague:




I was going to ask if the City can look into what we can do 
with that situation. We have seen that a lot with formula retailers such as with 
7-11.  This type of retailer is going into certain neighborhoods that have a 
certain number of mom and pop stores or family-owned groceries or prepared food 
[services], and little restaurants. There is a concern that the impact could be 
great on those kinds of businesses.  I was wondering if it is something that we 
could prohibit from happening, or limit the square footage of certain kinds of 
food or products.  It was raised before. I think we should calendar it. We will 
calendar it for July 7 as an item.




Commissioner Moore
:




I support what she was suggesting.  The question is whether 
or not the definition of formula retail needs to be re-defined or tied up. I do 
believe that the policy involved, while it is a forward-looking policy in the 
protection of the essence of the City being small-scale retail, needs specific 
protection, in specific parts of the City. You could make that the theme of our 
special meeting. I think that would be fantastic. 




Commissioner Sugaya:




I would like to request if we could have a short staff memo 
on the Masonic Auditorium.  It does not have to be calendared. In a recent court 
case it is my understanding that the environmental report needs to be redone if 
they move forward with their current plans. The other part of the court decision 
seems to invalidate that use at the moment; it is about the extension of the 
commercial district of a ¼ of a mile. If we could get an interpretation of that, 
that would be great. 




Commissioner Moore:




Hand in hand with that, is the question of whether the 
interior of that particular facility is to be preserved; whether it is 
completely untouched?  It is absolutely magnificent and the Historic 
Preservation Commission at the time when this project was before them did have 
the time to look at that. This is the time to look at all issues.

4.         Directorâs 
Announcements




            




Director Rahaim:




A couple of announcements:  I wanted to make mention of an 
upcoming meeting on the Market Street Project. This is a project that will look 
at the design of Market Street itself. The Department of Public Works is 
managing that with the assistance of the Transportation Authority and the MTA. 
We are in the process of gathering public comment. This is Tuesday the 24
th
 
- next week. You are all welcome to come. This will move into concept 
alternatives next year.




I just wanted to give you a piece of news regarding our new 
web site offering the property confirmation map that was just unveiled less than 
a month ago. Staff gave me statistics on the number of hits. It is getting an 
unbelievable amount of views. We are getting 27,000 hits a day on the web site. 
There is a lot of interest. Hopefully, it is providing a service to the public. 
27,000 hits a day is a staggering number. I never would have imagined that large 
of a number of hits on the website. I think that is it for me.

Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of 
Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.




 




LAND USE COMMITTEE: 






§
        

BF various Parkmerced. 


This week the hearing at the land use committee focused on 
updates to the draft Development Agreement and technical amendments to the 
Planning Code ordinance.  There was little discussion.  After taking public 
comment and accepting the proposed amendments to the documents, the hearing was 
continued without action.  The Committee will consider action on the Parkmerced 
ordinances at a special Land Use Committee hearing scheduled for 9:00am on 
Tuesday, May 24.  At its full Board hearing next Tuesday, the Board will not 
only consider the EIR Appeal-- but also if the EIR is upheld, the Board will go 
on to consider all of the actions related to the Parkmerced project.




§
        

Housing Element.
  At Monday's Land Use Committee hearing, the Board considered the draft 
Housing Element.   For this item, the     Board has already heard the appeal of 
the EIR and upheld the CEQA      document with an 8-3 vote.  Therefore this week 
the Land Use Committee was able to take action on the draft Housing Element 
(HE).  The Committee heard public  comment that was largely consistent with 
comments made at the  Planning Commission hearing (some expressed concern that 
adoption of the housing element would result in a re-zoning of RH districts - 
staff clarified that this is not part of the housing element).  After public 
comment the Committee thanked staff for their work, asked staff to respond to 
public comments and clarify the effect of the Housing Element, and expressed 
support for the Housing Element; the Committee voted unanimously to recommend 
adoption of the Housing Element to the full Board.  The Board is scheduled to 
vote on the HE at next Tuesday's meeting.
 






FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:




§
        

New 
Legislation for 800 Presidio.  


Commissioners, on April 28th, 
2011 you heard legislation related to a proposed project titled the âBooker T. 
Washington Community Services Mixed Use Center.â  At that time you took actions 
approving the project with about 50 units of housing (including 24 low income 
units and 24 transitional housing units for youth at risk), a community center 
and a gym within a 55â height limit.  Since your action two new pieces of 
legislation have been introduced at the Board.  The first, was introduced by 
Supervisor Farrell.  It is an amendment to his original legislation for the 
project.  This new version would limit the height to 45â [BF110116, version 2].  
The second piece of legislation was introduced by Supervisors Mirkarimi, Mar, 
and Avalos [BF 110658].  This second, proposed Ordinance would allow a 55â 
building-- consistent with the project you have approved.  Since you have 
already considered this project, the Board has calendared both versions of the 
legislation without the typical 90-day wait.  Currently the Ordinances are 
scheduled for a June 6th hearing before the Boardâs Land Use Committee.

Planning 
Commission.





Board of Appeals: 




Kelley Amdur, I am the Acting 
Zoning Administrator for today and tomorrow. I have a very brief report from the 
Board of Appeals hearing last night. There was one signed case being heard at 
926 Howard.  The appeal was denied. This was an appeal from Foster Interstate 
Media and the Department's permit was upheld.




HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:




Historic Preservation Committee 
did meet yesterday. There are three items I would like to bring to your 
attention. One is was a proposal for the Administrative Certificate of 
Appropriateness -- the Commission approved that with some modifications:  they 
would allow the administrative approval of this if the property has less than 
20% of the faÃ§ade being modified that would require the Certificate of 
Appropriateness within the Department in a five-year period. The âissueâ of the 
Administrative Certificate of Appropriateness would have to come back to the 
Commission within a year. The Commission also had a Historic Resource Survey. 
There was some discussion. They did not take action. They continued the item to 
the next meeting on June 1.  There was also a hearing on the nomination of the 
North Beach library to the National Registry of Historic Places. The Commission 
just passed a motion that they are informing them that they cannot reach 
consensus either way on the nomination. They could not decide to nominate it or 
not, so they sent it forward without support either way.
