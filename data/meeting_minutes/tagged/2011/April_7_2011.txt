Commissioner Miguel
:  
[Although the tape malfunctioned prior to and during Commissioner Miguelâs 
comments, they were regarding census data information.]





Commissioner Antonini
:  
I met with representatives of Treasure Island regarding the changes that are 
coming forward.  I met with representatives of the Academy of Art University 
today and on Monday I met with representatives of AT&T.  I also want to thank 
staff, Theresa Ojeda particularly, for a very good summary of the census and 
changes.  It was interesting to me that we are seeing similar movements as we 
saw generations ago of the different ethnic groups moving from the inner city to 
the outer parts of San Francisco, which is what we would expect, because as 
people look for situations where they can have home ownership; where they can 
have a garage; where they can have more space for their children and an 
opportunity presents itself, itâs normal to see this kind of movement.  The good 
news is, unlike what we did in the â60âs, we are not demolishing the inner city 
from whence they came, and we are in fact saving improvements in these areas 
where areas are being upgraded and there is a great interest.  I hope that will 
continue and weâll do what we can to continue that sort of process.





Finally, another fire today in a building in the Mission District â it seems 
like there is one of these every month, if not two or three of them â people 
being displaced.  I think we need a solution to figure out a way to provide 
incentives, probably through changes in some laws in San Francisco, to allow 
people to invest into these buildings; to upgrade them seismically to make them 
safe for their inhabitants, and perhaps in return for providing for some 
affordable housing at a different site, this might be a doable thing.  It would 
take some work by the Board of Supervisors, but I think this would be a great 
way to solve the problems we have in some of our historical but challenged built 
forum.  





Commissioner Borden
: 
I volunteer regularly with the Red Cross and there was a fire in the Tenderloin 
and 20 to 30 units were affected including a 5 unit SRO residential hotel.  
Right now 60 people from the units are in shelters.  We also had 12 people 
displaced from a fire in the Mission District.  All of those displaced people 
have found a place to stay.  I just want to remind people that the Red Cross, in 
addition to the major national disasters that we know of, are first responders 
and are there for the silent disasters.  So when you hear about the fire in 
Chinatown, or the Tenderloin, itâs the Red Cross that is there to make sure that 
people have shelter, food, and clothing until they can transition to a more 
permanent residence.  To that point:  next Friday on Union Square, we are going 
to have Disaster Preparedness Day.  The Red Cross is going to launch a new 
three-year initiative along with Mayor Lee and the Fire Chief to build a model 
that is resilient focusing on our most vulnerable communities in San Francisco 
and make sure those communities are prepared.  We are really worried about the 
older housing stock.  I really want to encourage people to come out next Friday, 
April 15, at Union Square.





Commissioner Sugaya
:  
Following up from Commissioner Miguel:  I did read the staff memo on the census 
and Iâm looking forward to more information.  About the same time I was reading 
that, I saw this supervisorial district map with statistics on District 10.  I 
frankly couldnât figure out what it was trying to tell me even though it says 
itâs from the San Francisco Elections Task Force.  I was trying to compare these 
numbers to the numbers in the memo.  Maybe staff can take a look at this.





Secondly, parklets seem to be in the news lately.  Maybe we can have a staff 
report.  I think it was in the Examiner that DPW has upwards of 40 or 50 
applications of people who have expressed interest.  They have issued a number 
of permits for parklets.  And then there has been controversy over parklets â 
the last one being that you canât provide food service across the sidewalks.  So 
maybe if staff could put together a report for us that would be great.  







Then lastly, Iâm going to put on Commissioner Leeâs hat for a moment.  
Commissioner Lee was always reminding us of the importance of tourism [weâll 
pass that on to Commissioner Fong here], but several weeks ago, I think 
Commissioner Miguel mentioned it, that tourism was up in the city 3% number wise 
and up 6% in terms of revenue.  Statistically that meant that 8.34 billion was 
spent, in which $385 million came to the city of San Francisco.  But of interest 
to me was the information further in the article that one of the notable 
positives was the high percentage of repeat visitors (74.3%), which I think 
everyone in this industry strives for.  The question:  why do they come?  [The 
first answer is] overall ambiance and atmosphere.  I think that speaks to the 
work that the Planning Department and the Commission are trying to do, not just 
with Historic Preservation in neighborhoods, but overall quality of design, 
which Commissioner Moore is always advocating for. 





Commissioner Olague
:  
I also was going to suggest that we have a discussion on the census results 
after our calendars clear in June or July.  Also, I notice that when I talk to 
other folks that work doing outreach with families,, that families have felt the 
pressure of living in the Mission and other neighborhoods from development, 
higher rent, all those pressures, a lot of folks have migrated into the 
Tenderloin and the SOMA area.  So we are seeing an immigrant increase in some of 
those families in some of those districts as well.  I think it would be really 
good to have a discussion about all of that.  I thank Ms. Ojeda for her work 
with that.  





Manufacturing is something I think is interesting.  I think it might be 
interesting at some point to look at the economy in San Francisco; where the 
jobs are; what people are doing.  I know SPUR has started to schedule a 
different walk or tours of different types of manufacturing.  I missed one this 
week, but they are going to have a few more that will look at places where 
certain breweries and other types of manufacturing that take place on a smaller 
scale.  Later on, maybe we can look at that a little bit â where the jobs are.





Also, speaking of tourism and what draws people to San Francisco, I know that 
years ago it used to be really easy to see live music in San Francisco.  It 
seems to be dwindling on some level.  Before you could go to 11
th
 
Street; you could go to Paradise Lounge and see poetry; hear a local band; folk 
music, metal music; and all these different types of entertainment.  In the 
â80âs it was so accessible and Iâm just hoping that there are certain 
protections when we make decisions up here that we think about â how do we make 
sure that these businesses that are adjacent to residences that have been sort 
of creeping up in the different regions â Slims just had their license revoked 
for about a couple of weeks â I just think that when we are talking about 
protections for neighbors, we should also think about some of these businesses 
that keep San Francisco vibrant and fun and artistic and affordable. 





Commissioner Moore
:  
I just want to express my support for scheduling a meeting on the census.  There 
are different sources and information coming in from all kinds of people I think 
that expresses their common field that if nothing else, can create some clarity 
across the board.  We should consider saving the information we have and then 
putting it together and sorting it out.  




 


B.         DIRECTORâS REPORT

3.         
Directorâs Announcements




 




Director Rahaim
:  
I just want to respond quickly to a couple of your requests.  We had been 
looking at a hearing date for the census.  I think we will pick a date in early 
July.  On that note about the American Community Survey, that essentially 
replaces what used to be called the Long Form that a certain percentages of 
households used to get during the regular census years.  They quit doing that in 
2000 and replaced it with this, which actually goes out to a smaller number of 
people every two years.  One of the concerns that we have had about this process 
is that people tend not to take it seriously because it does not come in regular 
census years.  Staff is concerned about the accuracy of some of the data because 
tend not to respond.  It is one of those things that we are looking.  Theresa is 
really our expert on that.  




About the 
parklets:  I think it is time to do a memo about the status of the parklets.  I 
think there are about 40 of them that were applied for, which is generally a 
good thing.  There is some controversy about how they are used and whether or 
not there is a perception that they are being privatized or not.  We can address 
that in the memo as well.




I wanted to 
mention that I will be going to the annual Planning Conference tomorrow in 
Boston this year.  I will be there from tomorrow until next Wednesday.  I will 
be here for next weekâs meeting, but while I am out, Bill Wycko will be in 
charge of the Department.  I will be doing what I have been doing for the part 
several at the conference, which is participating in what is called the Faculty 
of New Directorâs Institute.  It is an all-day training session on Saturday for 
new and perspective Planning Directors in other cities.  It is a very 
interesting event.




I also want to 
mention that I will be out the last week in April, partially for a symposium at 
the Garrison Institute north of New York City.  The symposium is called Climate 
Cities and Behavior.  It is a small group of public officials.  In this case, I 
received a full scholarship including room and board to attend the symposium.

4.         Review 
of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and 
Historic Preservation Commission.





 





BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:





 





Land Use Committee:

110147 Mission Streetscape Plan. 


This item is a 
General Plan Amendment of the Mission Area Plan to reflect the Commissionâs 
adoption of the Mission Streetscape Plan.  On January 20, 2011 the Commission 
adopted the Plan and adopted a resolution to amend the General Plan with this 
Ordinance.  While no Board action was required for the adoption of the 
streetscape plan itself, the Board does need to adopt the Ordinance to amend the 
General Plan.  
This week the LU Committee recommended approval of the 
Ordinance to the Full Board.





 





Full Board of Supervisors:




§
 


Urban Agriculture.  


This week the 
Full Board heard the ordinance that would ease regulations on gardening and 
farming in San Francisco.  At the February 17th hearing, the Commission voted to 
recommend Approval with 7 Potential Modifications of the proposed Ordinance. The 
modifications included:




1)
    

Further clarify that sales of produce grown on site may occur.  
This 
was incorporated into the ordinance.




2)
    

Modify the compost setback to at least three feet from structures. 

Again, accommodated.




3)
    

Renumber the Section for Urban Agriculture from 102.34 to 102.35.  

Done.




4)
    

Clarify that the fencing requirement is optional and that should fencing 
be used that it need not be completely opaque.  
In this case, Legislative 
Sponsor, Supervisor David Chiu, chose to expand the fencing options for 
agricultural uses to include chain link fencing WHEN the fencing is covered with 
plantings.




5)
    

Continue working to keep permit and change of use fees for urban 
agriculture minimal and to compare permit fee differences between short-term and 
long-term uses of land for Urban Agriculture.  
Staff looked into this issue 
and shared the costs of temporary use fees with the Urban Ag. Working Group.  
This group consisted of the Legislative Sponsors: Mayor Lee, Supervisor David 
Chiu, various city departments and various representatives of urban agricultural 
business operators.  In the end, the group did not feel the fees for temporary 
or seasonal use provided enough relief to warrant use and instead preferred the 
regular entitlement process.




6)
    

Consider looking into adding language into the proposed Ordinance to 
allow value added sales.  
In this case, the Mayor amended the Ordinance to 
allow Limited Sales of value-added goods in all districts except âRâ districts, 
and only then in the case where the primary ingredients are grown on site. 






7)
    

Explore the use of soil testing to clarify concerns related to soil 
toxicity.  
In this case, there are preemptive state and federal laws that 
govern the growing conditions for food to be sold to the public.




In addition to 
these changes recommended by the Commission, Mayor Lee amended the legislation 
to incorporate the PUCâs amendments for Water Conservation.  Supervisor Chiu 
changed the name of "Industrial Agriculture" use to "Large Scale Urban 
Agriculture."  
After making these amendments Supervisor Cohen signed on as 
the third sponsor.  This week the Full Board passed the Ordinance on first 
reading.




 




Three Ordinances 
were before the Board for Second Reading.  Each of these passed their Final 
Reading.  




§
 


Zoning Map Amendment - Correction to Market and Octavia Area Plan.  


This proposed 
Ordinance, sponsored by Supervisor Mirkarimi, would amend the Zoning Map to 
reflect the actions by the Commission from 2007.   The Planning Commission 
approved the Market & Octavia Plan on April 5, 2007. After this action by the 
Commission, the Boardâs Land Use Committee made some additional amendments.  At 
some point after transmittal of the Commissionâs recommendation to the Board and 
prior to final action by the Board, some of the pages of the Zoning Map 
Ordinance were inadvertently omitted.  Although the Board voted on zoning maps 
that were consistent with the Commission action, some of the pages that listed 
the zoning changes were not included.  
This week
 
the Board approved 
the Ordinance that would merely correct this error.  




§
 


Upper Fillmore NCD Changes.  


This proposed 
Ordinance, sponsored by Supervisor Farrell, would remove the current prohibition 
against new restaurants in this NCD.  Under the proposal, restaurants would be 
allowed by CU.  This Commission considered the Ordinance on 1/13/10.  At that 
time you recommended approval but with the recommendation to also allow large 
fast-food restaurants by CU.  Since your recommendation, the Supervisor worked 
with the Department and appropriate merchant and neighborhood groups.  The 
Supervisor then amended the legislation in three ways.  First, per your request 
the Ordinance would now allow large fast food restaurants.  Second, the 
legislation was also amended to specify that when the Commission considers 
restaurants in this area, the Commission shall consider whether the use would 
propose lunch service or other daytime usages in order to limit the number of 
such businesses that have no daytime activity. Lastly the Ordinance would allow 
a new bar via CU when that bar is provided in conjunction with a full-service 
restaurant.  
With these amendments, the Board approved the Ordinance on first 
reading.




·
        


101053 Consistent Street Frontages
.  
This proposed Ordinance, also introduced by Supervisor Mirkarimi is a larger, 
bolder piece of legislation that seeks to revise parking, use, and street 
frontage regulations in select areas to conform with more contemporary policies 
in San Francisco.  All told, the proposed Ordinance amends or repeals 
twenty-eight separate portions of the Planning Code
[i]
. 
When the Commission heard the Ordinance on January 13
th
, you 
suggested over a dozen revisions and also asked for staff to work with 
Supervisor Mirkarimiâs office on refining controls for houses where the garage 
extends out in front of the house.  Since your hearing, staff and the Supervisor 
have worked to incorporate all of your suggestions.  
This week the LU 
Committee recommended approval of the Ordinance to the Full Board.





Introductions:




·
        




There was one hearing request by Supervisor Cohen â Supervisor Avalos 





requested a hearing on the Cityâs plan or preparations in the event that the 
State eliminates Redevelopment in California.  Specifically, the hearing would 
discuss what the City would do to ensure continuity of comprehensive community 
development strategies such as affordable housing, workforce, and commercial 
development.  This was referred to the Budget & Finance Committee.




§
 


Mayor Lee introduced a series of Ordinances to implement the Treasure Island / 
Yerba Buena Island Project:  


including:




o
   


110230 Subdivision Code Amendment




o
   


110228 General Plan Amendment

Treasure Island/Yerba Buena Island Redevelopment Project
 
- 
Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report
 The Treasure 
Island Development Authority (TIDA) is proposing a 
Redevelopment Plan for the 
Treasure Island/Yerba Buena Island Project
 that would provide the basis for 
redevelopment of portions of Naval Station Treasure Island. The project site is 
located on Treasure Island and Yerba Buena Island and the immediately 
surrounding waters (Assessors Block 1939, Lots 1 and 2). The proposed project 
would include development on Treasure Island and Yerba Buena Island of up to 
8,000 residential units; up to 140,000 square feet (sq. ft.) of new commercial 
and retail space; up to 100,000 sq. ft. of new office space; adaptive reuse of 
three historic buildings on Treasure Island with up to 311,000 sq. ft. of 
commercial, retail, and/or flex space; about 500 hotel rooms; rehabilitation of 
the historic buildings on Yerba Buena Island; new and/or upgraded public and 
community facilities; new and/or upgraded public utilities; about 300 acres of 
parks and public open space including shoreline access and cultural uses such as 
a museum; new and upgraded streets and public ways; bicycle, transit, and 
pedestrian facilities; landside and waterside facilities for the Treasure Island 
Sailing Center; landside services for an expanded marina; and a new Ferry 
Terminal and intermodal Transit Hub.  Infrastructure improvements would include 
geotechnical stabilization to improve seismic safety.  The proposed project 
would also include green building specifications, programs to encourage transit 
use, design standards that would enable photovoltaic panel installation on most 
roofs, recycled water use, and other features promoting 
sustainability. Construction and build-out would be phased and would be 
anticipated to occur over an approximately 15- to 20-year period. The proposed 
project would require amendments to the San Francisco Planning Code and the 

San Francisco General Plan.
  The Draft EIR identifies potentially 
significant, unavoidable environmental impacts on aesthetics, historic 
architectural resources, transportation, noise, air quality, wind and biological 
resources. 





Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the Final EIR

899 Valencia Street
 - 

Appeal of Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration -
 The proposed project 
would demolish the existing service station, now used for surface parking, and 
would construct an approximately 50,000-square-foot (sq-ft), five-story, 52 
1/3-foot-high residential building containing 18 3-bedroom dwelling units, with 
7,100 sq ft of ground-floor retail space. The proposed building would have a 
below-grade parking garage accessible from 20
th
 Street with 14 
residential and four retail off-street parking spaces. The 10,925-sq ft project 
site (Assessorâs Block 3596, Lot 113) is within the Valencia Street Neighborhood 
Commercial Transit (NCT) zoning district and a 55-X height and bulk district on 
the block bounded by Valencia Street to the west, 19
th
 Street to the 
north, Mission Street to the west, and 20
th
 Street to the south, at 
the northeast corner of Valencia and 20th Streets in the Mission District 
neighborhood. The proposed project would require a conditional use authorization 
for development of a parcel exceeding 10,000 sq ft, for a non-residential use in 
excess of 3,000 sq ft, and to allow for permanent conversion of a service 
station to a new use.

EXECUTIVE PARK â 
INITIATION OF PLANNING CODE TEXT AMENDMENTS
 
- 
The 71-acre Executive Park Subarea Plan Area is 
located in the southeastern part of San Francisco, just east of U.S. Highway 101 
and along the San Francisco/San Mateo County border. It is generally bounded by 
Highway 101 to the west, Bayview Hill to the North, Jamestown Avenue to the east 
(but not including those lots fronting on Jamestown), and Harney Way to the 
south.  Parcels that would be affected by the Planning Code Text and Map Changes 
are bordered by Executive Park Boulevards West, North, and East on the west, 
north, and east respectively and Harney Way on the south (also referred to as 
the office park portion).  
Request to Initiate Amendments to the San 
Francisco Planning Code that would add Section 249.54 to establish the Executive 
Park Special Use District; add Section 263.27 to establish Special Height 
Provisions for the Executive Park Special Use District and the 65/240 EP Height 
and Bulk District; and amend Table 270 to provide that the Table is not 
applicable, pursuant to Planning Code Section 302(b).
  The new Executive 
Park Special Use District (SUD) would create special provisions for buildings 
within the office park portion of the site that would, among other things, allow 
for density transfers across the site, and include requirements for street and 
open space improvements.  The new height and bulk provisions would generally 
allow buildings between 65-feet and 85-feet along with three towers between the 
heights of 170 to 240 feet.  The design review provisions would require review 
by the Planning Commission of all new development projects.   These amendments 
along with proposed changes to General Plan Amendments Zoning Maps and the 
proposed establishment of Design Guidelines, would  provide for the transition 
of the existing office park portion of the site to a new mixed-use predominately 
residential, pedestrian oriented neighborhood.  These amendments would 
accommodate up to 1,600 dwelling units, approximately 70,000 gross square feet 
of retail, approximately 2,425 off-street parking spaces and other associated 
uses, in approximately thirteen buildings that would range between 65-feet to 
240-feet tall.

EXECUTIVE PARK â 

INITIATION OF ZONING MAP AMENDMENTS


 - 
The 71-acre Executive Park Subarea Plan Area 
is located in the southeastern part of San Francisco, just east of U.S. Highway 
101 and along the San Francisco/San Mateo County border. It is generally bounded 
by Highway 101 to the west, Bayview Hill to the north, Jamestown Avenue to the 
east (but does not include those lots fronting on Jamestown), and Harney Way to 
the south.  Parcels that would be affected by the Planning Code Text and Map 
Changes are those bordered by Executive Park Boulevards West, North, and East on 
the west, north, and east respectively, and Harney Way on the south (referred to 
as the office park portion).  
Request to Initiate Amendments to the

San Francisco Planning Code by amending Sectional Maps 
SU10 of the Zoning Map to establish the Executive Park Special Use District; 
amending Sectional Map HT10 to establish the 65/240-EP Height and Bulk District; 
amending Sectional Map ZN09 to change certain Executive Park parcels from 
C-2(Community Business) and M-1 (Light Industrial) to RC- 
3(Residential-Commercial Combined, Medium Density).  


More specifically, Sectional Map ZN10 would be amended 
by rezoning Assessorâs Block 4991, Lots 074, 075, 085 and 086 from C-2 to RC-3; 
Assessorâs Block 4991 / Lots 012, 024, 061, 065, 078 and Assessorâs Block 5076, 
Lots 012 and 013 from M-1  to RC-3; Planning Code Sectional Map SU10 would be 
amended to include Assessorâs Block 4991, Lots 012, 024, 061, 065, 074, 075, 
078, 085, 086, and Block 5076 Lots 012 and 013 into the newly established 
Executive Park SUD, and Sectional Map HT10 would be amended to include 
Assessorâs Block 4991, Lots 074, 075, 085 and 086 within the newly established 
65/240-EP Height and Bulk District.   These actions along with the proposed 
General Plan Amendments and Planning Code Text Amendments would provide for the 
transition of the existing office park portion of the site to a new mixed-use 
predominately residential pedestrian-oriented neighborhood.  These amendments 
would accommodate up to 1,600 dwelling units, approximately 70,000 gross square 
feet of retail, approximately 2,425 off-street parking spaces and other
