Inquiries/Announcements
.  Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).


·
         
Future Meetings/Agendas
.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.


 


Commissioner Moore:


BCDC reviewed the first update report on the America’s Cup and some ideas were presented. Some provided answers, and as always there was a huge group of new questions. Very insightful first set of questions came from the Bay Trail, describing at least eight very specific projects which would be advantageous to be accomplished. At some point, perhaps we can get a presentation. Very positive response by everybody who heard it, particularly for the area along Fisherman's Wharf in the Jefferson Street area, which makes so much sense. I think there will be a major push to understand how that really can help the City as a direct benefit from the America's Cup. I will report on the other details as they come up. There was solid discussion, and I am positive that the right people are sitting at the table to watch this very closely.


Commissioner Antonini: 


Often we discuss ways ….  The subject of one of our items last week was to foster greater public participation in planning issues, and I think that is a great topic. We are not alone in disappointing public participation. The election on Tuesday, I think if we are lucky, we might get up to a 40% turnout, which I think is really not good.  I do not know what the reason is, but being a student of history to some degree, I think in 1975, we had a turnout for a Mayor's race with an open seat, and we had a turnout of 80-82% in that November election. 


Commissioner Miguel
: 


I wanted to take the opportunity – although the results are not official, they seemingly are final – to congratulate the winners in the San Francisco election held this week and also to say thank you because my mail box can become unstuffed and my phone can stop ringing.

7.         Director’s Announcements


Director Rahaim:


Just three announcements today, I wanted to announce, and I think you have a flyer on this – there is a Workshop on the Chinatown Street Design Project on November 16 from 4:00 to 5:30 next Wednesday. There has been a series of workshops on the effort on Broadway separately.  Second, I think you know that tomorrow is a holiday in honor of Veterans Day, so the office will be closed tomorrow, as are most City agencies. Third, I will be out of the office, as I think I mentioned earlier.  I will be in New York for the Zoning Conference. During my absence, Kelly Amdur will be in charge of the Department.

8.         Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.


 


LAND USE COMMITTEE: 


§
  
Rental Incentive Option offered by EN Plan for the property at 2121 Third Street.  
This week the Land Use Committee considered the first development agreement to allow on-site rental housing instead of payment into the inclusionary housing fee. The committee considered a resolution authorizing the Planning Director to execute an agreement on behalf of the City of SF for rental housing at this location.  The proposed project
[1]
 has already been approved by the Planning Commission but needed Board action to finalize the agreement.  This agreement will commit the project sponsor to providing affordable rental housing on-site.  Typically, the Affordable Housing requirement for this area would be a fee equal the cost 20% of the units.  This agreement will allow a reduction to 17% inclusionary requirement and a $1 fee per gross square foot waiver of the Eastern Neighborhoods Public Benefit fee in exchange for a 30-year commitment to affordable rental housing at this location. 
 After a short hearing, the Committee recommended approval of the resolution.


 




                                                          




FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:


 


§
  
Alcoholic Beverages in Bowling Alleys in the Mission Alcoholic Beverage Special Use Subdistrict
 introduced by Supervisor Kim
.
  The Planning Commission had unanimously passed a resolution at its September 22, 2011 hearing recommending that the Board of Supervisors adopt the proposed Ordinance, with one substantive modification:


•
       
to include an additional exception for single-screen movie theaters, allowing these theaters to serve beer and wine.  


Supervisor Kim has amended the Ordinance to include the both of the two recommendations of the Planning Commission.
  This week the Full Board passed the Ordinance on fnal reading.
  


§
  
Acts of God and Calamity Ordinance.  
At the July 14th, hearing, the PC recommend that the Board adopt the Ordinance with modifications.  Specifically, the PC recommended the Ordinance be modified to allow a reasonable degree of flexibility for those who have experienced a calamity but not to be overly permissive in allowing rebuild of nonconforming uses. Since the PC hearing, staff has recognized that the recommendation should have been applied not only to Section 181 Non-Conforming Uses but also mirroring changes should have been recommended to Section 188 Non-Conforming Structures. Both Sections have the exact same problematic and vague existing language.  
This week the Full Board approved the item on first reading. 


INTRODUCTIONS:

 - 

        San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) Expansion and Fire Station No. 1 Relocation and Housing Project - 
Certification of Final Environmental Impact Report
. The project sponsor, SFMOMA, proposes to expand the existing SFMOMA located at 151 Third Street (Assessor Block 3722, Lot 78) and relocate Fire Station No. 1 from its existing 676 Howard Street location (Assessor Block 3722, Lot 28) to 935 Folsom Street (Assessor Block 3753, Lot 140). The sponsor proposes demolition of the existing 7,620-square-foot, 4-story-over-basement building at 670 Howard Street (Assessor Block 3727, Lot 027), and demolition of the existing 4,400-square-foot, 2-story Fire Station No. 1 at 676 Howard Street as well as vacation of a 115-by-30-foot land-locked portion of Hunt Street located between 151 Third and 670 and 676 Howard Street to accommodate the museum expansion. SFMOMA would construct an approximately 200-foot-tall, 230,000-square-foot building addition at the rear of the 151 Third Street building and on the 670-676 Howard Street parcels and the vacated Hunt Street right-of-way extending from Minna Street to Howard Street in order to display the museum’s existing and future art collections and to consolidate its support functions on site. The proposed expansion wing would connect to the existing museum and accommodate expanded gallery, public and support spaces. Portions of the existing museum would be renovated, including an expanded restaurant. The ticketing lobby now located in the atrium would be relocated to the second floor, so that the ground floor of the museum, including the Third Street atrium and new ground floor gallery on Howard Street would be publicly accessible without charge. The existing building at 935 Folsom Street (formerly used for apparel manufacturing and commercial laundry, currently vacant) would be demolished, the site subdivided, and a new 15,000-square-foot, 2-story-plus-mezzanine, approximately 34-foot-tall replacement fire station would be constructed on the northern portion of the parcel fronting Folsom Street. At-grade parking would be provided for 15-vehicles on the site. On the southern portion of the 935 Folsom Street site, a 4-story, approximately 43-foot-tall future residential building would be constructed comprising up to 13 residential units and 10 off-street parking spaces in the building’s basement level. 


The 151 Third Street site is located in a C-3-O (Downtown Office) Use District and a 500-I Height and Bulk District. 670 Howard Street is located in a C-3-S (Downtown Support) Use District and a 320-I Height and Bulk District. 676 Howard Street is located in a P (Public) and the 320-I Height and Bulk District. The 935 Folsom Street parcel is located in a MUR (Mixed-Use Residential) District and an 85-X/45-X Height and Bulk District. As part of project approvals, the Planning Commission will consider a recommendation to rezone 676 Howard Street from P to C-3-S to accommodate the proposed museum expansion and to rezone the northern portion of 935 Folsom Street from MUR to P, consistent with the proposed fire station use. No amendments to existing height districts are proposed. 


Preliminary Recommendation: certify the Environmental Impact Report


NOTE: The public review period for the Draft Environmental Impact Report is closed. The Planning Commission does not conduct public review of Final EIRs. Public comments on the certification may be presented to the Planning Commission during the public comment portion of the Commission calendar.

SFMOMA would construct an approximately 200-foot-tall, 230,000-square-foot building addition at the rear of the 151 Third Street building and on the 670-676 Howard Street parcels and the vacated Hunt Street right-of-way extending from Minna Street to Howard Street in order to display the museum’s existing and future art collections and to consolidate its support functions on site. The existing building at 935 Folsom Street would be demolished, the site subdivided, and a new 15,000-square-foot, 2-story-plus-mezzanine, approximately 34-foot-tall replacement fire station would be constructed on the northern portion of the parcel fronting Folsom Street, including at-grade parking. On the southern portion of the 935 Folsom Street site, a 4-story, approximately 43-foot-tall future residential building would be constructed comprising up to 13 residential units and 10 off-street parking spaces in the building’s basement level. The 151 Third Street site is located in a C-3-O (Downtown Office) Use District and a 500-I Height and Bulk District. The 670 Howard Street site is located in a C-3-S (Downtown Support) Use District and a 320-I Height and Bulk District. The 676 Howard Street site is located in a P (Public) District and a 320-I Height and Bulk District. The 935 Folsom Street site is located in a MUR (Mixed-Use Residential) District and a 85-X/45-X Height and Bulk District.
