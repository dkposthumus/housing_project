INTENTION TO INITIATE COMMISSION-SPONSORED 
PLANNING CODE AMENDMENTS RELATED 
TO A PROPOSED PLANNING COMMISSION POLICY FOR STANDARDS FOR BIRD-SAFE BUILDINGS



 -




Pursuant to Planning Code Section 302, the Planning Commission will consider a 
Resolution of Intention to initiate amendments to the Planning Code. The 
amendments are intended to a) reduce building-related hazards for San 
Franciscoâs resident and migrant bird species; b) establish consistent building 
standards for creating bird-safe buildings; and c) provide certain exemptions 
from these requirements. The proposed Ordinance would amend the Planning Code to 
create a new Section, 139 Standards for Bird-Safe Buildings; and would amend 
other sections, including Section 145.1; and adopting findings, including 
environmental findings, Section 302 findings, and findings of consistency with 
the General Plan and priority policies of Planning Code Section 101.1.




Preliminary Recommendation: Approve a draft Resolution of intention 
to initiate amendments to the Planning Code and schedule a public hearing on or 
after July 14, 2011 to consider the amendments.

At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a 
Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda 
of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.




 





Commissioner Antonini:




Last night I went to the 
movies on Van Ness at the AMC Theater, and decided to take a walk and have 
dinner in the neighborhood.  The area along Middlepoint, where we walked was 
kind of troubling.  Maybe we just hit a bad night.  There was a lot of vacancy, 
a lot of people with challenges, not in very good condition.  This is just 
something important that we need to note.  This is an area that needs help, and 
whatever we can do to increase the revitalization of that area we will be good 
to find out what is going on in that area.




Secondly, yesterday there 
was a decision on a item that we had before us in the past:  it was 800 Presidio 
and it ended up in appeals and did not sustain what the Commission had approved 
which was a higher structure, and the only comment I have on that is, well I am 
not a believer that the Districtâs Supervisor should have ultimate authority in 
his or her District, as to what is going on there.  But I feel we worked with 
District Supervisors on planning issue and often we come up with some good 
suggestions and compromises that address impact and mitigate them for their 
neighborhood and still get the project approved.  I am hoping that we will be 
able in the future to have success working with the District Supervisors.  I 
think that one was a little unfortunate but we will just see what happens in the 
future.





Commissioner Olague:




Weâve had a lot of success 
working with the Supervisors and we can name several of them, including our work 
to some extent with Supervisor Alioto-Pier on this project.  We have been 
working with her office for a number of years.  We also talked to Supervisor 
Farrell. I think the three of us had a three way conversation with them.  I hope 
in the future, we continue to work for the greater good of the City.




I attended a Neighborhood 
Network meeting last Friday.  It was a good meeting, but I forgot my notes.  I 
will bring them next week, because there were several issues that came up.  One 
was they are wondering when the comments and responses for CPMC will be released 
and if there will be a fair amount of time for the public to review those 
documents before the hearing.





Director Rahaim:




On that issue Iâve asked 
staff to allow at least 30 days.  Normally you get two weeks in advance of the 
hearing to review comments and responses.  We donât know when exactly the final 
hearing date will be established, but as soon as we know we will make sure the 
public knows â at least a month in advance.





Commissioner Moore:




Could I ask a question 
with respect to the last comment including the Directorâs responses:  since some 
of us will use the August time to be away, I hope that responses are not coming 
out then and be counted in that time; time when we will not be physically here. 
 I hope that will be taken into consideration.




 


D.         DIRECTORâS REPORT




 




9.         
Directorâs Announcements




 





Director Rahaim:




Last week, I believe 
Commissioner Moore asked about the recent legislations that have been proposed 
regarding redevelopment law.  I talked to Director Fred Blackwell this week. 
 There was a report in the Examiner yesterday that was pretty accurate.  The 
bottom line is that there are two pieces of legislation on the Governorâs desk 
regarding Redevelopment Agencies.  They are related: 1) would eliminate the 
agencies as he has proposed several months ago.  The deadlines are not clear a 
this point; 2) essentially would an exemption to that, that would allow some 
agencies to maintain their activities, but would require them to pay the State - 
pay their local school districts back for the funds that are used in 
redevelopment thru tax increase and financing.  As you recall, under 
redevelopment law and the State, the State has to fill the gap that the tax 
increment takes from the school districts, and that is the money that the 
Governor is interested in, and trying to see it return to the State.  So the 
second piece of legislation would allow the agencies to continue under that 
condition that money is returned to the school district. In that case, for the 
SF Redevelopment Agency that is something like $24 million dollars.  Whether 
they can come up with those funds is not exactly clear at this point.  And it is 
also not clear what the Governor is going to do.




The second thing I want to 
report to you is that I attended last night for the first time in a long time if 
not ever the Western Soma Task Force Planning Group meeting.  Of course they 
have been meeting for many years, but as we are getting closer to the completion 
of the EIR and bringing the plan in front of you, I wanted to have more intense 
conversation with them about several issues.  The recent stabilization policy 
was the topic of interest/discussion last night as well as some other issues 
that have come up in that neighborhood.  I intend to attend more of their 
meetings in the coming months as the plan gets close to adoption.   We are 
tentatively scheduled to bring it to you as an informational item in early 
September.

Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of 
Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.




 




BOARD OF 
SUPERVISORS:




BUDGET COMMITTEE: 




§
 

On 
Monday, the Budget and Finance Committee heard the Annual Salary and 
Appropriation Ordinance for many Departments, including Planning.  Director 
Rahaim presented a summary of our budget, which included accomplishments from 
this year, projects for next year, and summary of our $24.5 Million budget 
request for next year.  On Monday, the department had not reached agreement with 
the Budget Analyst's recommendations.  Next Monday June 27th, the department 
will return to the Committee and anticipates reaching agreement with the Budget 
Analyst in order to finalize the department's FY11-12 budget.
           





LAND USE COMMITTEE: 




§
 




BF Various Executive Park.  



This week the Land Use Committee considered amendments to the General Plan, 
Planning Code and Zoning Map that would enable mixed-use development in an area 
that had been zoned for suburban style office and hotel development.  
Commissioners, you heard this item on May 5th at which time you recommended 
approval with modifications to enable the relocation of one tower one block 
towards the east.  An addendum to the EIR was completed to assure no new impacts 
were created prior to the hearing.  Last week, t
he Committee made amendments 
changing proposed Planning Code text regarding the tower location.  This week 
the Committee forwarded the Ordinances as amended.




§
 



BF 110268 2451 Sacramento.  





The Committee also heard a Ordinance for this address that would change the 
zoning for this address from (RM-1) to Upper Fillmore Street NCD.  You 
recommended approval of this action on February 24 of this year.  
Without 
either public comment or Board comment, this item was forwarded with a 
recommendation for approval.




§
 



BF 110277 Vintage Signs.
  
This week the Land Use Committee considered amendments to the Planning Code 
introduced by Supervisor Campos that would allow for more types of signs to be 
covered under the historic sign ordinance, you heard this item on June 2 at 
which time you recommended approval with modifications.   Supervisor Campos 
incorporated your recommendations into the proposed legislation and chose the 
word âvintageâ to replace the word âhistoric.â  The item, as amended, was 
continued until next weekâs Committee hearing.
 






 




FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:




§
 



BF 110482 Misc. Code Amendments. 




On August 5, 2010, the Commission recommended approval of the technical 
modifications to the Planning Code.  As the Planning Commission and Historic 
Preservation Commission are continuing in their dialog about historic 
preservation issues, all modifications related to historic preservation have 
been removed at the request of the Planning Commission President. 
 This week 
the Board approved the Ordinance on first reading.




§
 




Housing Element.
  
On Tuesday, the Board considered the draft Housing Element.  For this item, 
the Board has already heard the appeal of the EIR and upheld the CEQA document 
with a 8-3 vote.  
This week, the Housing Element passed on final reading.




§
 



BF 101350 Parking in SoMa and Mission 
Bay.  T
his 
proposed Ordinance sponsored by Supervisor Kim on April 28 would revise parking, 
use, and street frontage in the Western SoMa area to conform to more 
contemporary policies in San Francisco.  The Commissionâs April 28 
recommendations were incorporated into the Ordinance. 
This week the Board 
approved the Ordinance on Final Reading.




§
 




Two Appeals of 800 Presidio/Booker T Mixed Use Development
.  
Both appeals were filed by Steve Williams and residents of the area.  








 





On the CEQA appeal the major points argued by the appellant included that: an 
alleged âpreapprovalâ of the project had occurred; there were issues of land use 
compatibility; and that the analysis of historical resources, in particular were 
not sufficient.  The Department clarified that funding from the MOH in no way 
impedes the Cityâs discretion to disapprove the project; the neighborhood was 
transitional as described by the Commission and not as described by the 
appellant âa small-scale 100% residential community;â and lastly that EIR found 
that the project would not adversely affect this potential district because the 
Center itself is not architecturally significant and is outside of any potential 
historic district.  






 





For the CU appeal, the appellants contended that the project was not consistent 
with the General Plan and they pointed to select policies from the Urban Design 
Element. Staff countered that contrary to appellant statements decision-makers 
must base their findings on consistency with the entire GP.  While individual 
policies may at time conflict the final decision is whether the project is
 
on balance,
 consistent with the Plan.  The Commission had considered the 
plan in relation to not only the Urban Design Element 
but also
 the 
Transportation, Housing, and Community Facilities Elements.  And in this case 
the Commission found the project consistent with the General Plan and necessary

or 
 desirable 
and
 compatible.  





 





After the presentations and public comment the District Supervisor, Supervisor 
Farrell, made comments that he intends to apply CEQA fairly and that he found 
the EIR to be adequate and accurate.  With his lead statements, the Board upheld 
the EIR unanimously.  On the CU appeal, the Board again upheld your CU 
authorization unanimously.  The vote on the SUD, however, was different.  
Supervisor Farrell led with a summary of his efforts to find compromise and 
concluded that all neighbors had agreed to support a 45â building.  With this he 
moved to amend the SUD to allow only 45â instead of the Commission approved 55â 
project.  Supervisors Wiener, Elsbernd, and Carmen Chu joined him in this motion 
to amend the SUD.  The motion fell short of the 6 votes needed to amend the 
SUD.  On the final vote of the SUD, only Supervisors Farrell and Carmen Chu 
voted against the 55â recommended by the Commission.  
So, the project as you 
approved it remained intact after Tuesdayâs hearing.

Board of Appeals: 





Last night, the Board of Appeals heard one case of interest to the Commission - 
1787 Union Street (dba The Brickhouse).  The subject project (outdoor patio at 
front of a restaurant) was before the Planning Commission as a DR on January 20, 
2011.  At this hearing the Commission unanimously approved the project with 
conditions, including limitations on seating, hours of operation and the number 
of doors that could remain open to the outdoor seating area. The Board of 
Supervisors did hear and rejected a CEQA appeal on the project earlier this 
spring.  Yesterday, the Board of Appeals heard the matter and believed that 
additional measures could be adopted to address neighbor concerns regarding 
noise.  The Board voted to continue the item to August 10, 2011, with direction 
to the Permit Holder to investigate alternative methods for addressing the noise 
issues including, but not limited to, changing the operation of the doors to the 
patio.

151 THIRD, 670 
and 676 HOWARD and 935 FOLSOM STREETS
 -


San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) Expansion and Fire Station No. 1 
Relocation and Housing Project â
 
Informational Hearing.
 The project 
sponsor, SFMOMA, proposes to expand the existing SFMOMA located at 151 Third 
Street (Assessor Block 3722, Lot 78) and relocate Fire Station No. 1 from its 
existing 676 Howard Street location (Assessor Block 3722, Lot 28) to 

935 Folsom Street (Assessor Block 3753, Lot 140). The sponsor proposes 
demolition of the existing 35,000-square-foot, 4-story-over-basement building at 
670 Howard Street (Block 3753, Lot 27), demolition of the existing 
12,000-square-foot, 2-story-with-mezannine Fire Station No. 1 at 676 Howard 
Street, and vacation of a 115-by-30-foot land-locked portion of Hunt Street 
located between 151 Third and 670 and 676 Howard Street to accommodate the 
museum expansion. SFMOMA would construct an approximately 200-foot-tall, 
230,000-square-foot building addition at the rear of the 151 Third site, on the 
670-676 Howard Street parcels and the vacated Hunt Street right-of-way to house 
the museumâs expanding art collections, and to create galleries to display the 
Doris and Donald Fisher Collection. The proposed expansion would connect to the 
existing museum and accommodate expanded gallery, public and support spaces, a 
publicly-accessible renovated ground-floor, expanded restaurant, a new Howard 
Street entrance, and a relocated ticketing area on the second floor with 
galleries and support spaces on the floors above. The existing building at 935 
Folsom Street (formerly used for apparel manufacturing and commercial laundry, 
currently vacant) would be demolished, the site subdivided, and a new 
15,000-square-foot, 2-story plus mezzanine replacement fire station would be 
constructed on the northern portion of the parcel fronting Folsom Street. 
At-grade parking would be provided for 15 vehicles on the site. On the southern 
portion of 935 Folsom Street, a 4-story, approximately 43-foot-tall residential 
building would be constructed comprising up to 13 residential units and 10 
off-street parking spaces in the buildingâs basement level. The 151 Third Street 
site is located in a C-3-O (Downtown Office) Use District and a 500-I Height and 
Bulk District. 670 Howard Street is located in a C-3-S (Downtown Support) Use 
District and a 320-I/500-I Height and Bulk District. 676 Howard Street is 
located in a P (Public) and a 320-I/500-I Height and Bulk District. The 935 
Folsom Street parcel is located in a MUR (Mixed-Use Residential) Use District 
and an 85-X/45-X Height and Bulk District, and the SOMA Youth and Family Special 
Use District. The projects are subject to the California Environmental Quality 
Act and would require a determination of compliance with the Downtown Plan; 
vacation of Hunt Street and conveyance to SFMOMA; rezoning of 676 Howard Street 
from P to 

C-3-S; amendment of the Disposition and Development Agreement with the 
Redevelopment Agency; lot merger; rezoning of 935 Folsom Street from MUR to P; 
lot subdivision; design approval for a new public building (Arts Commission); 
and demolition and building permits. 




Preliminary 
Recommendation: Informational only; no Commission action.
