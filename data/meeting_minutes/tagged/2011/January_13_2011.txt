Commissioner Miguel:





If I may start off:  During the break â and welcome back everybody â I have met 
regarding CPMC, the 24
th
 Street cell tower, an item on Pleasant 
Street, and I also met with three of the four incoming new Supervisors.  I was 
out of town for the fourth.  Staff did extremely well in briefing the new 
supervisors regarding the Planning Department, introducing them to senior staff, 
taking their questions, and that sort of thing.  That went very well.  Also, I 
recently received two communications from Theresa Sparks, Executive Director of 
the human Rights Commission.  They followed a discussion of Commissioner 
Sugayaâs comments at our November 18 meeting and realized they were not 
expressed by the whole Commission.  They expressed thanks for the Commissionerâs 
apology made at that Commission meeting and appreciated his willingness to 
engage in sensitivity training.  My understanding is that the human Rights 
Commission is considering the possibility of such training for all San 
Franciscoâs commissioners on all Commissions.  I assured her that if such a 
program is instituted, the Planning Commission will most certainly participate.




Commissioner Moore
:





I just wanted to express my delight about San Francisco winning the Americaâs 
Cup and some of the challenges that will allow us to showcase what the 
Department has done - the new plans.  Hopefully, we can kick some of them in 
with great speed â such as the Better Streets Plan.  We want to show the streets 
bordering the bay in full force.  I have a question for the Director.  I was 
confused about the message I got yesterday saying they are taking on the 
planning of Ocean Avenue.  In addition, they were talking about, as I understand 
it â in electronics letters are abbreviated â they were taking on the joint 
planning downtown.  I was hoping that the Planning Department was already in 
charge of physical planning and would stay in dialogue and would be a full 
participant in all these efforts.




Director Rahaim
:





Thank you for that.  SPUR received a grant from the State of the Feds to do 
planning and outreach work along Ocean Avenue, which is part of Ocean Beach, 
part of the Golden Gate national Recreation Area.  It is not under our 
jurisdiction in the Department.  The Planning Department is part of a larger â¦; 
I sit on the advisory group, along with several other Department Heads from 
Recreation and Parks and the Public Utilities Commission in overseeing the 
effort.  They did specifically receive a grant to be the lead on that effort to 
convene Department Heads and agencies to look at issues along Ocean Beach.  On 
the second part of your question â I will look into that.




Commissioner Moore
:





I think both of them are interesting.  It is very positive.  I just hope that we 
will never encourage fragmented efforts, especially on Ocean Beach properties, 
which we frequently talk about.  I hope there will be open doors for all of us 
to hear and see and participate in a wonderful effort.  I hope there is an 
invitation to us.




Commissioner Borden
:





I would also like to reiterate what Commissioner Moore said about being thrilled 
about the Americaâs cup.  I look forward to the environmental review documents.  
I also want to congratulate all the new Supervisors and the new Interim Mayor.  
I look forward to working with them on planning issues and to having a very 
productive time on a couple of issues.  When is the Presidio scheduled?  I know 
there are plans for a hotel there.  Meetings have been canceled.  I was 
wondering if we could have someone from the Presidio update us on their plans 
and their philosophy.  That way the community has a forum that is a little more 
public than the existing forum.  If that would be something other commissioners 
could agree to, that would be great.  The other thing is that I wanted to 
request that the Park Merced project scheduled for February 3
rd
 be 
moved because I will be out of town.  After sitting through all the hearings, I 
would like to weigh in on the outcome.




Commissioner Miguel
:





[Unintelligible]




Commissioner Borden
:





No, I will not.




Commissioner Olague
:





I believe it is also Chinese New Year on the third.  There may be members of 
staff â Commissioner Fong may want to spend time with his family.  That is what 
I have heard from the Chinese community that it is a problem having Park Merced 
scheduled on that day.  That made my life easy.




Commissioner Borden
:





I would like to request an update on the market and Octavia Plan.  I am not sure 
when that is going to be scheduled.




Commissioner Olague
:





I would kind of like to hear that.  I know I have not had an opportunity to 
speak with Commissioner Miguel about this.  We had a sustainable strategy 
discussion scheduled for January 27.  I would not mind having a little bit of 
the information about Market and Octavia ahead of that discussion.  I was 
actually going to request at some point that rather than hear the discussion on 
the 27
th
, that we move it over to February.  I wonder if we can 
possibly move that up to February 10.




Commissioner Miguel
:





I will say, tentatively, one of the concerns is that we might, given 
Commissioner Bordenâs request that we might want to move that to the 10
th
.  
If so, we might not want to have other major projects on the agenda that day.




Commissioner Olague
:





[Maybe] later in February â the 17
th
 or the 24
th
.




Commission Secretary Ionin
:





Ironically, the calendars are already getting quite awful for the first 
quarter.  We will see what we can do.




Commissioner Olague
:





We can move Market and Octavia on the 27
th
.  I know we cannot move 
things up once they are scheduled, but I think the 27
th
 is pretty 
crowded.  The 24
th
 is pretty light, so maybe the 24
th
 
could work for Sustainable Community Strategies discussion.  It deals with 
transit oriented development, etc.  I would like to have that conversation 
proceed.




Commissioner Antonini
:





Just for discussion purposes, we do have a calendar for the year, but we are not 
going to take that up today.





 




Commissioner Miguel
:





It is not on the agenda.  It is strictly a draft.




Commissioner Antonini
:





Unless I here otherwise, the dates on the calendar will be â¦ - I have a couple 
of things:  I thank staff for as always, the excellent Commerce and Industry 
Report from 2009.  There is good news and bad news.  The good news is that San 
Francisco in 2009 was the only county in the Bay Area to grow both in population 
and also the number of residents employed in the Bay Area labor force, which is 
good.  In fact, our increase in unemployment was the lowest of any of the 
counties.  But the bad news is as many of you have heard, is that we have lost a 
lot of employees from state compensation.  We lost the entire operation.





I did have the occasion to talk to people over the break, both employees and 
employers, about the things that most drive businesses away or keep businesses 
from coming here.  Some of these are beyond our scope.  They obviously talked 
about cost factors and the extraordinary fees and policies that cost businesses 
a lot more to operate in San Francisco than in other counties.  A lot of 
individual people talk about non-elective public school assignments outside of 
one neighborhood, and that could be dealt [with] in other areas, but they are 
not land-use assignments.  There could be changes of that coming up.  On thing 
they did talk about was the general appearance of the City.  I am glad to hear 
that the Better Street 



policy is coming up. The graffiti and litter and things that have to be dealt 
with more severely, but I think, to be able to eliminate that -- certainly, the 
greening of San Francisco and the college on a number of the streets helps to 
take some of the harsh edge off. It is a little troubling to walk around 
sometimes. But they also brought up the lack of middle sized housing, 
particularly adequate sized middle-class housing.  I think that is something we 
will be addressing in the Housing Element, making sure we pay attention to what 
you hear time and time again from people who are beginning to raise families and 
have to leave San Francisco because they cannot find not just a affordable, but 
any kind of housing that fits their needs.  Those are some issues that will be 
coming up. 





The other thing I wanted to mention briefly was about a fellow that passed away 
during the time we were on break. His name was Mike Gregotti. He had a heart 
attack. He was the basketball coach at Lincoln High School.  The thing that was 
particularly nice about Mike is two things. He grew up in the Epiphany Parish in 
Excelsior, but stayed here, raised his family here, and did not go off to the 
suburbs. Most importantly, he pursued his avocation, which was the coaching of 
high school basketball, he helped so many kids. The whole Lincoln High School 
team was at the remembrance.





Commissioner Fong:







I want to wish everyone a Happy New Year, and I wanted to share my 
congratulations with our Mayor, Mayor Lee.  It is a great opportunity for Mayor 
Lee.  I want to call him Ed.  He is a capable man with great integrity and will 
be great for San Francisco.  With the America's Cup, our waterfront has an 
opportunity to showcase itself. The project has not come before this Commission 
yet, but the work the community has done with the public program along Jefferson 
Street is fantastic. If there is any way to look at accelerating that plan with 
the America's Cup deadline looming, it would be a great opportunity for San 
Francisco to showcase some great streets to the world. 





Commissioner Olague:





I wanted to also congratulate Mayor Lee. Having our first Asian Mayor in San 
Francisco is very exciting.  During his acceptance speech, he mentioned that he 
was progressive before the word progressive was coined. I think that is true. He 
was a longtime attorney at the Asian Law Caucus. I have no doubt that he will 
help the entire City. I am excited about having the opportunity to work with 
him. One thing I forgot to mention earlier is the local hiring ordinance that 
was passed by the Board. Is that going to affect the language in some of our 
conditional uses in some of our permittings? I guess that is something I was 
wondering how that is going to have an impact on some of the decisions we make 
here and the language of that. 





Director Rahaim:




            I believed it 
had to do with construction projects, but I will confirm that and get back to 
you.





Commissioner Borden
: 
 





 I have one question I forgot to ask. It is my understanding new Governor 
Brown's budget will be cutting out tax increment financing in development areas. 
I would love to have someone from the Redevelopment Agency or the Mayor's Office 
of Housing discuss how that would impact 

our house and developments here, and our job growth and some of those 
empowerment jobs --  empowerment zones such as Bayview Hunters Point. It would 
be nice to raise public awareness about the implications if we can mount a 
successful campaign to do whatever is needed to be done to meet that aspect, if 
it is indeed counter to what we have been trying to accomplish. 






Commissioner Moore: 





I would like to add my voice to welcome our new Mayor. It will be wonderful to 
work together, particularly with someone who has as much experience as he has in 
the City. I would also like to welcome the Supervisor who will be sitting on the 
Land Use Committee, an important bridge to our work, Supervisors Mar and 
Weiner.  I am excited to meet them. 






Commissioner Sugaya:





I would like to note Supervisor Mar is the Chair of that Committee. I do not 
have much more to add, but to the Director, congratulations on some new glasses. 
[Laughter] 






Commissioner Miguel:





Obviously, I extend my congratulations also.  I have already congratulated the 
Supervisors individually. I have not had the chance to do so with our new Mayor, 
although I have had the pleasure of working with him in several capacities over 
the years. I am not sure that people understand, following on Commissioner 
Olague's comment, how active and progressive he was in San Francisco. The other 
thing, following on Commissioner Borden's request regarding the Presidio - that 
is a very controversial issue. I, through a couple of organizations, have been 
involved in Presidio matters for over 20 years now, and there are two major 
groups in addition to the Presidio Trust that should be invited to that hearing 
so that we do not have a one-sided presentation, which is the way it normally 
has come out with the Trust when it is invited somewhere. One would be the 
Presidio Historical Society. The other would be the Neighborhood Association for 
Presidio Planning, which is a group of neighborhood associations that touch the 
Presidio which have been meeting at least monthly since before the army closed 
down. It is a longstanding group of neighborhood associations. They should be 
included in any hearing on the parade grounds, lodge, etc.




Commissioner Moore
: 
 





I want to share with you an observation about the transformative values of 
redoing trees. 

I always hated to drive down a particular street. It was a street I avoided at 
all costs. But last night, I drove down Divisadero and it was late at night when 
you donât want to go there, but it was beautiful. It is one of the streets that 
has good pavement. The lighting, the landscape -- it pulls together the street 
as a space. It is remarkable. I want us to remember that as we move into our 
discussion of our Better Streets Plan. I think it is a wonderful and it is 
simple. I hope it will be one of many to come.




 


D.         DIRECTORâS REPORT




 




5.         
Directorâs Announcements




 




Director Rahaim:




Let me add my 
thanks to all of you for getting through another year last year.  Happy New Year 
to all of you.  I look forward to an interesting new year.  We have a full year 
ahead of us, as is already showing up on our calendars.  A couple of things:  
over the last few weeks, as President Miguel mentioned, staff has briefed three 
of the four new supervisors.  Supervisor Kim had to be rescheduled.  It included 
Senior Managers and the Zoning Administrator and the Director of Legislative 
Affairs.  It was a good overview of what the Department does, the Planning 
Commission does, and what the Historic Preservation Commission does.  It was 
useful to hear from them what their concerns were, and what they know and do not 
know about our work.  I hope this is the opening of a good dialogue with the new 
supervisors.  As you know, we are entering budget season next week.  We have a 
memo in yor packet that will help you today â the first of a series of budget 
briefings.  The good news, I think at this point, is that this will be the first 
time in three years that we will not have to consider layoffs.  I hope that 
sticks over the next few months as the budget moves forward.  Many of you 
mentioned the Americaâs Cup.  We are gearing up very quickly, working with the 
Office of Economic Development and the Port and the Department of Public Works.  
They will all play a role in this in terms of creating facilities and 
properties.  We are part of that interdepartmental team.  Our primary role is 
the EIR, but will also be playing a role with respect to preservation issues.  
Many of the piers are historic resources.  With respect to improvements to 
streets and the public realm, that is an important part of it, especially given 
the new plan where there will be separation of the piers used for the event.  
The connections will be an important part of how we plan for the event.  The 
last thing:  I wanted to mention briefly, related to the Presidio, that we will 
ask the Trust to come back with the other organizations you mentioned.  Many of 
you might recall, â¦  I believe that will count as part of the original plan that 
you saw.  I do not believe they have proposed changes to that master plan.




           





6.         Review 
of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and 
Historic Preservation Commission.





 





LAND USE COMMITTEE:





AnMarie Rodgers:





There was a lot of excitement. I will let you read the papers for that. There 
was a Land Use Committee hearing. They did hear an ordinance sponsored by 
Supervisor Dufty that would allow neighborhood banners to be posted on lampposts 
along Market Street. The Committee began deliberations on the ordinance in 
advance of the recommendation from the Historic Preservation Commission at the 
end of the legislative session. The Committee moved the legislation forward 
without recommendation while waiting for the HPC. The HPC did recommend 
modifications, such as a fastener that is reversible and will not damage the 
historic landmark. That also recommended modifications to specify the procedure 
for how banners may come before them for a certificate of appropriateness 
consideration. That ordinance was amended to take into account the Historic 
Preservation Commission recommendations. This week, it was adopted on its final 
reading. 





At the Full BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:





Also on Tuesday, the Board heard a CEQA appeal for 10 Lundy's Lane, for a 
single-family dwelling in normal heights -- Bernal Heights. The appeal was to 
rebuild two rear walls originally built in the 1970's. They found the permit to 
be categorically exempt from CEQA review. Even though they are correct that the 
building was a category D potential resource, the work in question was 
restricted to rebuilding rear walls on a non- historic addition that was less 
than 50 years old. That was approved for the CADEX.  The CEQA determination was 
unanimously upheld 11-0. It would amend the house an ordinance to add a new 
alternative in the market to save your plan area. You'll remember the planned 
dedication we had in Eastern Neighborhoods. That came before Market Octavia was 
adopted. This would add this as a possibility in Market and Octavia in lieu of a 
fee. Also introduced was an amendment to the NC-3 District to require active 
commercial uses for some properties within the Supervisor's District. 







There were two ordinances introduced, both of which you have considered in full 
before. The first one I know you have. It is changes to the Market Octavia plan. 
The ordinance would include some parts that were inadvertently excluded from the 
zoning map having to do with the Western Addition Area. The staff has checked 
this. You passed the zoning amendment exactly the way it is included in this 
revision ordinance. We will just recommend that since you have already made this 
recommendation, we will recommend to the board that they act on this correction. 
The second one -- we still need to confirm that you have considered this 
completely. The second one is an ordinance introduced by Supervisor Maxwell that 
would provide a waiver criterion for affordable housing. You considered this 
with the Visitation Valley Plan Amendments will make sure it is exactly the same 
as what you considered that time. If it is, we will recommend we not have 
another rehearing on this since it is the same as your earlier recommendation. 
The other two ordinances will be before you in 90 days, per our usual process.






Commissioner Antonini:





Ms. Rogers, thank you for your report. I have a question on the path of gold. 
Some years ago, I made inquiries about the possibility of putting American flags 
along there. I think I was told at that time that the flags could only be hung 
during a parade, before and after the parade for a period of time. I am not sure 
if the ordinance or body of law has changed, but I would like to hear if that is 
any different.





AnMarie Rodgers
:





The law previous to this new ordinance did require exactly as you stated, only 
temporary banners having to do with an event. This would allow longer banners 
and if they pertain to neighborhood -- pertain to a neighborhood resource. 
People would be referred to the HPC for appropriateness, but they would be 
allowed to stay for a longer period of time. 




 





BOARD OF APPEALS:







Scott Sanchez, Zoning Administrator:





The Board did one thing this Commission might find interesting:  an appeal of a 
building application that was not before this body as a DR.  It had gotten a 
Section 311 notice.  It was a modification to the existing fourth floor at the 
rear of the building, very sensitively designed from the adjacent side 
property.  The appellant was in an existing legal non-complying building which a 
box on the south street side.  They are within about 20 feet of this rear 
addition.  Both the addition and the proposed deck were set back 5 feet from the 
side property line.  The Board felt this was an appropriate design and 
unanimously upheld the permit.

Parkmerced is a rental housing complex constructed between 1941-1951 consisting 
of approximately 3,200 existing residential units and owned by Parkmerced 
Investors, LLC. 
 This is an Informational Hearing to provide an overview of 
the proposed project components and draft Development Agreement. Specific topics 
to be discussed at this session include an Economic Feasibility and Fiscal 
Impact Analysis of the proposed project
. The project, which would be 
implemented over 20-30 years in multiple phases, includes the addition of 
approximately 5,700 net new residential units, the demolition and replacement of 
approximately 1,800 existing units which would remain subject to the San 
Francisco Rent Stabilization Ordinance, rent-protections and relocation rights 
for existing tenants, re-alignment and re-design of streets and blocks, 
re-alignment and improvement of the M Ocean View light rail line, the addition 
of new neighborhood serving retail and office space, new and re-configured 
public open spaces including neighborhood parks, pedestrian and bike paths, 
athletic fields, a new organic farm, and community gardens, overall 
transportation improvements, ecological hydrology improvements, and provision of 
renewable energy and water infrastructure. The draft Development Agreement would 
become the binding legal contract between the City and the Developer and would 
memorialize all of the public benefits and obligations of the Developer and 
associated agreements between both parties toward implementation of the Project.
