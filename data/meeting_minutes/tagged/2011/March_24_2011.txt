Request to consider, with a recommendation of the General Manager of the 
Recreation and Parks Department in consultation with the Recreation and Parks

San Francisco 2004 and 2009 Housing Element
 - 
Certification of the 
Final Environmental Impact Report
 The proposed project is the 2004 and 2009 
Housing Elements. The Housing Element is a public policy document that addresses 
issues relating to housing needs for San Francisco residents. The Housing 
Element is prepared in response to Government Code section 65580 
et seq.,
 
California housing element law, which requires local jurisdictions to plan for 
and address the housing needs of its population for attainment of state housing 
goals. The California Court of Appeals has determined the environmental document 
prepared for the 2004 Housing Element inadequate, and has directed the City to 
prepare an EIR for the 2004 Housing Element. The City must also comply with 
state housing element law and prepare another periodic update of the Housing 
Element. The City has undergone a community planning process and prepared the 
draft 2009 Housing Element. This EIR satisfies the Cityâs legal requirements for 
preparing an EIR on the 2004 Housing Element and also analyzes the environmental 
effects of the 2009 Housing Element.





Please note: The public hearing on the Draft EIR is closed. The public comment 
period for the Draft EIR ended on August 31, 2010. The Planning Commission does 
not conduct public review of Final EIRs. Public comments on the certification 
may be presented to the Planning Commission during the Public Comment portion of
