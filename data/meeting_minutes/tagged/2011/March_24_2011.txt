Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or 
inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).




·
        


Future Meetings/Agendas
.  
At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a 
Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda 
of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.




 





Commissioner Moore:
  
AT&T has announced that it has agreed to buy T-Mobile in cash and stock.  I 
would like this Commission to have a separate discussion about the extensiveness 
of the joint networks which we have basically supported but now I think this 
poses another challenge to us.  I would like to understand the challenge 
comprehensively with some knowledge from the Board [of supervisors] because they 
will probably be asking themselves the same question.  I would like to suggest 
that we all step back and understand what that means to us.




On 
another point:  I talked to you last week about the numbers of the U. S. 
Census.  I was able to get some additional information on that and that 
information made me a little bit more concerned.  There is an increase in 
vacancy from 4.8% in 2000 to 8.3% in 2010.  That is something we need to think 
about particularly as we are continuing to approve and approve.  We are creating 
theoretically additional vacancies â and Iâm not saying donât approve â but I 
would like to bring some more intelligence to how I look at the vacancies, what 
opportunities they offer, and what challenges they pose to us in decision 
making.





With respect I heard from Public Comment a few minutes ago, I sit on the 
Treasure Island Citizen Advisory.  This group together tries to find information 
on what infrastructure financing district means.  There isnât really a lot 
around.  There might be some experts who know something about it, but it still a 
pretty uncharted tool from what I understand in the state of California.  I 
think Florida has practiced it.  But the question that Mr. Welch raised for me 
is why we all will be struggling to look for new tool in lieu of Redevelopment, 
because we all need them in city governance.  I think we all need to understand 
what that really means so that we can support it in whatever way we support 
needs to be brought forward particularly in light of the fact that we have 
policy which is through the state.  But if that policy is challenged by new 
tools, we need to figure out how we formulate new policy to supplement, or 
re-define, or what the new tool needs to do if we use it.  Other projects will 
need to use this â Bay View Hunters Point comes to mind.  So I am asking this 
Commission to consider Mr. Welchâs suggestion to ask Mr. Morales to join us.  
Commissioner Olague, is that something you would consider?





Commissioner Olague:
  
Yes.  If Jim Morales would come and add his expertise to the discussion, I think 
it would be great.  I just donât know what his availability is.  In addition to 
Mr. Blackwell if he has the time, and Mr. Hillis so that we can have a robust 
discussion about what this means.





Commissioner Sugaya
:  
I think thatâs fine, but it seems like they are all in-house people.  I think 
from what Mr. Welch is suggesting, there might be some other expertise around 
who can look at if from a little different perspective.  I donât know who those 
people are, but a little searching around they might be outside consultants â 
someone other than Redevelopment Agency staff





Director Rahaim:
  
I am talking to Rich about getting someone from outside the city government to 
talk to us. 





Commissioner Antonini:
  
I think thatâs a good idea.  Maybe [we can get] someone from the Governorâs 
Office.  They certainly would have a perspective on it.





Many of you may have been watching the NC2A Division Championship basketball 
last weekend.  The sites of this tournament â not just the final four â but all 
the games beginning with last weekend are located in 12 different cities.  They 
include Dayton Ohio, Newark New Jersey, Tulsa, Tucson, Tampa Cleveland, 
Washington D. C., Denver and Chicago â all of which have lower populations than 
San Francisco.  Two have higher populations â Chicago and Huston â where the 
final 4 will play.  But the reason why we wonât host anything here is because we 
have no arena, and we havenât had one.  And this precludes us from any major 
concerts because capacity is too small, from National political conventions, 
from the NBA, or the NHL, or a lot of sources of revenue.  It is one of the 
things I comment on frequently and there are some plans afoot to do something.  
In times when we are challenged for revenue, and we are all trying to figure out 
ways to get more revenue in San Francisco, this is a source of huge amounts of 
revenue for events that can occur virtually 365 days or nights a year.  So it is 
something that we should pursue publicly and privately to see what can be done.





Commissioner Borden
:  
I want to pick up on a theme from Public Comment had related to the formula 
retail issue and the financial services.  I know that this commission and the 
department has always considered financial services and institutions to be 
separate from the formula retail legislation.  I think it might be worthwhile 
having a discussion here at the commission about the formula retail legislation 
in general and a look back I think nearly 10 years â and look at the impact and 
what has happened; and if there are any necessary needed updated related to it 
based upon the realities.  I think it would be useful to have a clarifying 
discussion.  In some cases it might be if people want to go the Board to make 
change etc., but I think it is worth looking at if it has impacted positively or 
negatively neighborhoods and what has been the outgrowth and the consequence.  I 
think one of the trends we have seen is more stores that do not necessarily have 
locations in the United States, but stores that have locations in Europe and 
other places opening up in San Francisco.  I know that there are other concerns 
that people have brought up that have arisen since we initially conceived the 
legislation.  I think it would be worthwhile having that discussion and looking 
at all the ramifications.





Commissioner Sugaya
:  
Iâd like to support Commissioner Borden on that and itâs partially based on an 
article I read a number of years ago maybe that had to do with concerns in New 
York city about the proliferation of branch banks in neighborhood areas and the 
fact that they didnât have a mechanism to address those issues.  So I would like 
to have something before us to discuss.





Commissioner Moore
:  
I would like to voice my support for what Commissioner Borden has suggested 
because partially I have seen one of the most unusual combinations of formula 
retail and formula banking just a few weeks ago â where you walk into a Starbuck 
and on the other side of the Starbuck you are complemented by a full set of 
banking services provided by Wells Fargo.  I find that is really a little bit 
over the top.





Commissioner Olague
:  
A couple of weeks ago we had that conversation on SB375 and I believe there was 
a follow-up meeting that people in the community was invited to.  I understand 
it was a really good discussion.  Is there going to be a follow-up to that?





Director Rahaim
:  
Nothing is scheduled right now, but I am happy to do that.  The staff that is 
working on that is working on the Housing Element too.  Once you adopt the 
Housing Element today, we are happy to work on that.





Commissioner Olague
:  
Great.  At one of our Monday meetings, we will check in with you on that.  I 
know that market and Octavia had a list of things that they wanted staff to look 
at and possibly bring back to us for amendment.  So I also want to get a status 
on that.  On the census, we should be scheduling a hearing here.  Maybe we will 
have some questions in advance so she (Theresa Ojeda) doesnât have to come here 
without that information.  As Commissioner Moore mentioned the vacancy rate and 
where are those, that sort of thing might be interesting to have.  I would also 
like to discuss a little bit about the shift in demographics in areas like South 
of Market and some of those districts.  I guess we should look at the calendar 
because I think we are starting to get a little bit behind in some of these 
hearings.  After May, we should start to schedule some of these policy 
discussions here â like the formula retail, like the census.  I think these 
other meetings are more community meetings with staff.  In the past weâve 
mentioned even tourism, and there are others that we can catch up on.  I was a 
little bit interested in this whole twitter discussion â it led me to think 
about manufacturing and some of these artisan type of businesses we are seeing 
here in the city.  I know that SPUR is having a series of walks on that 
subject.  But I would like to get a sense of where are the jobs for people in 
certain communities.  What is the state of manufacturing, or trends and 
workforce trends in San Francisco?





Commissioner Miguel
:  
On the formula retail discussion, I would be very interested in knowing as far 
as financial services is concerned, whether the City Attorney has ever given any 
weigh in on definitions as to the way the Code is written, because I think that 
is extremely pertinent.  All things are interpretive.  I would be interested to 
know what the City Attorneyâs interpretation of that is.  I donât think there is 
anything this commission can do without that.  




As 
far as Commissioner Mooreâs comments on the vacancy rates, I get confused by 
seeing figures all over the place and I have yet to see a definition or a 
methodology by which those figures are put together.  I donât know how thatâs 
counted.  I donât know if that is directly from the census figures and whether 
itâs âwell we rang the bell four times on four different days and we sent out 
two pieces of mail and no reply, so therefore it must be vacant;â I donât know 
what the criteria is for considering something vacant.  Without that the 
statistics are meaningless to me.  I think there is a great deal of actual fact 
that has to be gotten into.  Iâm not disputing the number; I just have no basis 
for believing it at the moment.    




 


C.         DIRECTORâS REPORT
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>




 




2.         
Directorâs Announcements




 




Director Rahaim:
  
I have a call into AT&T specifically to ask the question about what the 
implications are for their plans given their acquisition of T-Mobile.  I will 
get back to you on that.        We have talked to President Olague and Vice 
President Miguel about how to move forward with a plan with the carriers.  If 
you recall, the carriers do have a five-year plan that they submit to us.  But 
what seemed clear to us is that they should try to break that plan down into 
one-year increments to get a more immediate example of what all the carriers 
plans are so that we can see how they overlap.  We are working on that.




Just for your 
information â and Iâll send you the link from San Francisco Travel Now (the old 
San Francisco Visitorâs Bureau), they submitted their Annual Report on tourism 
statistics.




I signed a memo 
yesterday that Theresa Ojeda prepared on the census.  If you donât have that 
today, you will have that in the next day or two.  That question on the 
definition of vacancies is a very good one.  I had asked her the same thing.  
The memo does not address that, but we will address that in the future.  I think 
it is a good idea.  I will work with Linda on scheduling a hearing on the census 
information in the future.




Commissioner 
Olague:
  
Years ago we had a hearing on it and we invited Realtors and I donât think we 
got to the heart of the nature of our questions.  I donât think that is 
necessarily the source that should be invited to that discussion.

3.         Review 
of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and 
Historic Preservation Commission.





 





BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:





 





Land Use Committee:




·
        




Supervisor Mirkarimi sponsored an ordinance on Active Uses in NC-3 for certain 
parts of Fillmore Street â 



this
 
would requie that only active uses be permitted on the ground floor 
for certain part of Fillmore Street.  On 3/3, you recommended approval and 
requested expanding the definitions of active uses to include a new restaurant 
definition as âself-service specialty foodâ and âoutdoor activity area.â  
Supervisor Mirkarimi has amended the ordinance to incorporate your 
recommendations.  This week the Committee recommended approval of the ordinance 
to the full Board.




·
        




Supervisor Mirkarimi sponsored an ordinance on Consistent Street Frontages â




this legislation seeks to revise parking, use, and street frontage regulations 
in select areas to conform with more contemporary policies in San Francisco.  
All told, the proposed ordinance amends or repeals 28 separate portions of the 
Planning Code.  When you heard this on January 13, you suggested over a dozen 
revisions and also asked for staff to work with the Supervisorâs office on 
refining controls for what was called âsnout housesâ or houses where the garage 
extended out in front of the house.  Since your hearing, staff and the 
Supervisor have worked to incorporate all of your suggestions.  This week the 
Committee recommended approval of the ordinance to the full Board.





Full Board of Supervisors:




·
        




Development Impact and In-Lieu Fees â 



This ordinance is sponsored by the Mayor and would amend Article 4 to clarify 
language, eliminate confusion as to when the requirements must be met, increase 
consistency between the way impact fees are administered and correct errors in 
cross-referencing.  This commission heard this on 12/16/10 and recommended 
approval.  Since then the Mayor has amended it to include suggestions from both 
the mayorâs Office of Housing and the Controllerâs Office.  Among these changes 
was the addition of an uncodified section that will allow this yearâs adjustment 
of all fees for inflation within 30 days of the effective date of the 
ordinance.  The Board made this last change as an amendment on Tuesday and then 
approved the ordinance on first reading.




·
        




Zoning Map Amendment â Correction to Market & Octavia Area Plan â 



This proposed ordinance, sponsored by Supervisor Mirkarimi, would amend the 
Zoning Map to reflect the actions by the Commission.  This Commission approved 
the Market & Octavia Plan on 4/5/07.  The Boardâs Land Use Committee made some 
additional amendments.  As some point after transmittal of the commissionâs 
recommendations to the Board and prior to final action by the Board, some of the 
pages of the Zoning Map ordinance were inadvertently omitted.  Although the 
Board voted on zoning maps that were consistent with the Commission action, some 
of the pages that listed the zoning changes were not included.  The proposed 
ordinance heard by the Land Use Committee would merely correct this error.  The 
Board approved the ordinance on first reading this week.




·
        




Upper Fillmore NCD Changes â 



This proposed ordinance, sponsored by Supervisor Farrell, would remove the 
current prohibition against new restaurants in this NCD.  Under this proposal, 
restaurants would be allowed by CU.  This commission considered the ordinance on 
1/13/10 recommending approval but also with the recommendation to allow large 
fast-food restaurants by CU.  You also respectfully requested that the 
Supervisor continue additional public outreach.  The Supervisor has worked with 
the Department and appropriate merchant and neighborhood groups and has amended 
the legislation to allow large fast-food restaurants by CU; to specify that when 
the Commission considers restaurants in this area, the Commission shall consider 
whether the use would propose lunch service or other daytime usages in order to 
limit the number of such businesses that have no daytime activity; and lastly it 
would allow a new bar via CU when that bar is provided in conjunction with a 
full-service restaurant.  With these amendments, the Board approved the 
ordinance on first reading.




·
        




CEQA Appeal of 795 Foerster Street, 203-213 Los Palmos Drive â 



This week the Full Board heard a CEQA appeal of the Departmentâs Cat Ex 
determination for these properties.  The proposed project involves a subdivision 
of two lots into four and construction of three new single-family dwellings on 
three of the newly subdivided lots.  No changes are proposed to the existing 
single-family dwelling at the corner lot.  Despite the appellantâs arguments, 
the Department maintained its position.  The Board unanimously rejected the 
appeal and upheld the CEQA determination on a 9 to 0 vote.





Introductions:




·
        




There was one hearing request by Supervisor Cohen â 


On the proposed 
neighborhood plan for the Executive Park area.





 





BOARD OF APPEALS:





 




·
        



401 Divisadero Street
 â CHASE Bank â 


The Board did side with 
the Planning Department and our interpretation of the Code.




·
        



281 Turk Street
 â
 This was a re-hearing request for a 
building permit that authorized a pharmacy.  The Board had initially denied the 
application, but when it came to the adoption of findings, the decision changed 
and the permit was upheld.  The re-hearing request will allow both sides to have 
council represent them through the whole hearing process.




·
        




731 Commercial â
 
This was of a letter we had releasing suspension of the permit.  That item was 
continued to May to give us some time to work with the neighbors.

San Francisco 2004 and 2009 Housing Element
 - 
Certification of the 
Final Environmental Impact Report
 The proposed project is the 2004 and 2009 
Housing Elements. The Housing Element is a public policy document that addresses 
issues relating to housing needs for San Francisco residents. The Housing 
Element is prepared in response to Government Code section 65580 
et seq.,
 
California housing element law, which requires local jurisdictions to plan for 
and address the housing needs of its population for attainment of state housing 
goals. The California Court of Appeals has determined the environmental document 
prepared for the 2004 Housing Element inadequate, and has directed the City to 
prepare an EIR for the 2004 Housing Element. The City must also comply with 
state housing element law and prepare another periodic update of the Housing 
Element. The City has undergone a community planning process and prepared the 
draft 2009 Housing Element. This EIR satisfies the Cityâs legal requirements for 
preparing an EIR on the 2004 Housing Element and also analyzes the environmental 
effects of the 2009 Housing Element.





Please note: The public hearing on the Draft EIR is closed. The public comment 
period for the Draft EIR ended on August 31, 2010. The Planning Commission does 
not conduct public review of Final EIRs. Public comments on the certification 
may be presented to the Planning Commission during the Public Comment portion of 
the Commission calendar
.
