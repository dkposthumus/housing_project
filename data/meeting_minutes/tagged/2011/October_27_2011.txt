Commissioner Miguel:


During last week I have met with Jill Manton from the Arts Commission and others regarding an item on the calendar.  I have met with Supervisor Malia Cohen on cell phone towers in her District and a few other matters - 2135 Greenwich. I was at the meeting at DBI regarding the project tracking system that is about to actually start.  The team that is going to put this into place gave a presentation yesterday.  I thought it was excellent. Director Rahaim will give more details. 


Commissioner Olague:


A few weeks ago we had some neighbors from 15
th
 Street Avalon who were here to talk about a project going to the Board of Appeals. At some time I would like to have some kind of discussion – and I will work with Ms. Avery on this – I think it may be premature, but a memo for starters – that will be available to the neighbors as well. I did attend a neighborhood meeting and there are a lot of issues.  Regarding what was related I think that may be broader if we could involve other things.


Commissioner Antonini:


We have many emails and letters, faxes and phone calls. I welcome then at any time. In terms of how strongly that we consider them, the letters that are composed individually, with the individual named below them.  Residents of San Francisco or the area in question have more magnitude than things that are just sent anonymously, or from people who are not residents.  Everyone is welcome to send anything that they want from any place.  In terms of how much we give consideration [to an item] with viewpoints from individuals concerned vs. the same letter being sent over and over and often it is verbatim.

7.         Director’s Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


There are just a couple of things I wanted to mention regarding what Commissioner Miguel was talking about. Yesterday we had a kick off meeting on the permit tracking with the Department of Building Inspection.  This has been a long time coming project to vastly improve the tracking of projects. We had the internal kickoff meeting with staff that were involved in this project, and there was a meeting that was open to the public with a brief demonstration and we are excited about this. It will take two years to actually implement this system and put the system in use. There was some concern expressed yesterday about how both the Departments do business, and the conversion of years of data. This is a 30-40 year investment and it is important that we get this right.  Other departments can add on to this. This is the one place the public, staff and the Commission will be able to see the status of the project across all of the involved Departments. I also want to remind you about the Health Care Master Plan.  You have received this in an email.  Claudia Flores and staff have been working on the master plan. We were required to do this based on the legislation. The Department of Public Health is the lead and has assembled a task force. They hired a consultant to do the background work. Just an FYI: we will be looking for additional funding in next year's budget to continue the environmental work. This will be necessary to move the project forward. We will be seeking additional funding.

Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.


 


LAND USE COMMITTEE:


 


Alcoholic Beverages in Bowling Alleys in the Mission Alcoholic Beverage Special Use Subdistrict
 introduced by Supervisor Kim
.
  The Planning Commission had unanimously passed a resolution at its September 22, 2011 hearing recommending that the Board of Supervisors adopt the proposed Ordinance, with two modifications:


•
       
to include an additional exception for single-screen movie theaters, allowing these theaters to serve beer and wine.  


•
       
to refer to Planning Code Section 249.60, which is where in the Code the Mission Alcoholic Beverage SUD is now referenced.


Supervisor Kim has amended the Ordinance to include the both of the two recommendations of the Planning Commission.  The full committee was supportive, and moved the amended item to the full Board.
  Supervisor Wiener noted again this week that he would support a repeal of the Mission Alcohol SUD, as he feels that it is not achieving its original goals.


Supervisor Kim also noted that she has received word from Supervisor Campos that there may be good reason to further amend the ordinance to allow multi-screen movie theaters to serve alcoholic beverages.  The City Attorney's office recommended that a change from allowing single-screen movie theaters to multi-screen theaters would require re-referral to the Planning Commission; therefore, Supervisor Kim declined to make the amendment at this time, but voiced her support for trailing legislation to that effect.
 


FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:


 


§
  
4141 Geary CU appeal
.  
This Tuesday, the Board heard a CU appeal for the placement of cellular antennas at 4141 Geary Blvd, site of a Kaiser medical office Building.  This Commission heard the CU in July.  At that time only two people spoke in opposition and the Commission approved the project unanimously.  It was a different story this week at the Board with a two-hour hearing where the majority of the comment was opposed to the antennas.  While the appellants had not submitted a written argument, they had completed their own informal survey of cell reception and presented that to the Board.  The Board questioned staff about what sort of analysis was conducted on the documentation submitted by the applicant, Verizon Wireless.  Staff responded that the Commission is an appointed body that much like the Board, is not a technical expert in wireless antennas.  Instead, the Commission does the same review of submitted materials that the Board does; weighing the evidence presented before it and then using their discretion to decide the matter.  In this case, the Commission's decision to approve wireless antennas at this Preference One, or most desirable location, was unanimous. Supervisor Cohen asked if the Board could take any action to direct where WTS facilities are located in the future.  Staff advised that the Board that the existing Wireless Siting Guidelines is a Commission adopted document that has been developed through interactions with Board resolutions and decisions on appeal.  And that the Board could either suggest further refinement of the guidelines through Resolution or could legislate new siting criteria in the Planning Code.  The hearing ended with a request to continue the item from the district supervisor where the project would be located, Supervisor Mar.  The Supervisor said he wanted to accept and offer that Verizon had made to make their proprietary data on cell coverage and capacity available to a neutral third party expert.  
This party would analyze the data for presentation to the appellant and the Board. With that, the Board closed the hearing and voted to continue the item two weeks.

Japantown Community Planning Process and Initial recommendations
 - 
Informational Presentation - 
Since the August 2009 Japantown BNP presentation and 2010 information update made to the Planning Commission, significant and important progress has been made in the review and development of proposed amendments to the original DRAFT Japantown BNP (2009). The community representatives participating in this review process are committed to a comprehensive review and generating public support for their recommended revisions to the original neighborhood plan. The community, through formal votes and authorizations from the Japantown Organizing Committee, is currently prepared to share their initial review and recommendations with the Planning Commission and the general public. These community recommendations represent numerous significant departures from the recommendations in the initial 2009 Draft Japantown BNP Plan.
