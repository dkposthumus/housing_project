Commissioner Antonini:




There was a really good article by Ken Garcia this Sunday in 
the "Examiner," and it analyzes some of the reasons why many families are 
leaving San Francisco. So, Ken Garcia should know he is a San Francisco Native 
and attended St.Gabriel, when it was the largest school west of the Mississippi, 
and what we found were people with families are not far away in the San Mateo 
County and Marin County. The Pacifica has a lot of previous residents from the 
Sunset. What is interesting is he talks about many of these same issues we talk 
about here all the time -- difficulty with condo conversions for your own use, 
difficulty getting unit mergers. Of course, the school system, it is not a 
planning issue or has a relationship to it. So, very interesting that you have 
hit upon these things. I think there are a lot of reasons, although we always 
talk about cost. Cost is a factor, these residents in San Mateo County are 
paying just as much. They can get housing with conditions that are more 
acceptable to their families. We have to look at the process, what we're doing 
to drive families away.




President Olague:




I just wanted to welcome Jose Campos. I do not know if you 
have a few words for us at this time? 

Go ahead, please. Tell us a little bit more about yourself. 




Jose Campos:




President Olague, my name is Jose Campos. I am new to staff. 
I am coming from Spain where I was the last six years, but prior to that, I was 
a member of the San Francisco Planning Redevelopment Agency for eight years.





President Olague: 






Welcome. I also want to acknowledge that we will have some of 
the Chinatown Urban Institute with us today, so, if you have any questions, feel 
free to contact us through the director on this, if you want to elaborate more, 
understanding more about the workings of City Planning. Thank you.

We will spend the time with that. I wanted to acknowledge former Commissioner 
Sue Lee is here.

Sadly, three members of San Francisco Planning family have passed away this 
week, in the past two weeks actually. One being Secretary Linda Avery's sister, 
and Anthony Urbina, he used to help us set up the meetings here, and finally 
Roberts Pender, who was very active in the Parkmerced organization.




Finally, it yes, I think that sometimes -- the articles I 
have read on the exodus of families tend not to be very cost conscious, 
actually. They do not focus enough on the working class families, the challenges 
they face, to certain pressures, especially the Mission and other neighborhoods 
where you have seen an exodus of Latino families. It is important that we're not 
just limited to a certain sector of those who are leaving. I think it is 
important that we keep all families here, middle-class, above and below, and I 
think it is important that we have a conversation that covers all of the above.




Commissioner Sugaya
:




The conversation around families leaving the City is 
complicated. There was a recent "New Yorker" article, actually a long book 
review, talking about people leaving cities. For decades people are leaving 
cities. Not just San Francisco, but all around the Country, and moving to the 
suburbs. There are people moving back to San Francisco. They are different 
population. That kind of thing is universally happening, so it is not just here 
alone. I have not read the book that was given to us a couple weeks ago, but 
that was one of the books that was mentioned, along with a few others. In 
context, it is really not an isolated problem at all. 




President Olague
:




I think the same thing goes for manufacturing families and a 
lot of other issues. It is not simply -- you know, it is not that simple. 






Commissioner sugaya
:   I am not saying we shouldn't do something about it. It is 
just more complicated.




 


D.         DIRECTORâS REPORT

5.         Directorâs 
Announcements




John Rahaim:




I want to pass my condolences on to Linda Avery for the loss 
of her sister, and also the Department felt condolences for the family of 
Anthony Urbina, Anthony was a member of the City family for a very long time. He 
passed away two weeks ago. Several members of the staff were able to attend the 
funeral. Last week. I also wanted to welcome back President Miguel. It is good 
to have you back, looking good and healthy as always. I also want to welcome 
Jose Campos. Thank you and welcome. 




A couple of things I wanted to report to you. The Governor 
did indeed sign two bills last week related to Redevelopment Agencies, Senate 
Bill 26 and 27. Those bills did take effect immediately upon his signature. In 
summary, just where we are today, AB26 essentially prohibits redevelopment 
agencies from taking on new actions, including incurring new debt or making new 
loans or making new contracts or amending or adopting new redevelopment areas. 
They are subject to a number of new responsibilities under this particular bill. 
If the agencies do not comply with that provision they will dissolve as of 
October 1
st
 of this year, -- AB27 provides an exception to that. 
Actions primarily require them to -- for the City to adopt an ordinance saying 
it will volunteer to participate in the program, and that will require the City 
to make payments to the County for distribution to schools, fire protection 
agencies and transit agencies. I previously thought it was just schools, but it 
was three different entities that would normally be the recipients of the funds. 
That ordinance, if the City chooses to take this path has to be adopted by 
November 1 of this year. So the City and the Redevelopment Agency are looking at 
that right now. The cost is to be around $25 million. Whether the Agency would 
be able to do that and move forward. That would have to occur before November 1
st
 
of this year. Also, as you know, there have been a lot of discussions the past 
few months. Agency is considering legal action. The League of California Cities 
and the California Redevelopment Association, both of whom have claimed the Bill 
is in conflict with Prop. 22, which the voters passed last year, it prohibits 
the State from diverting funds from local development. There's an interesting 
discussion to have over the coming months about the impact going forward. The 
Governor did sign that Legislation on June 29
th
 it is effective 
immediately. The City has until November 1
st
  to make a decision 
about the alternative measure  The next thing I wanted to mention -- as you 
know, there are couple of ballot measures the Board has placed on the ballot. I 
sent a memo to staff, just reminding all of us the measure is on the ballot. 
Staff is not allowed to use office resources or spend City time to provide our 
analysis of the ballot measure, as long is it is impartial and does not advocate 
one way or another. One measure that is of interest to you, the proposal to 
prohibit demolition of 15 or more units on a single property, except under 
certain conditions that ballot measure is one of three. One of those more 
pertinent to our work. The one exception to our taking the position is we are 
allowed to attend the hearing next week at the Board to talk about what the 
Department believes, an analysis about the ballot measure. The Board has asked 
us to attend that hearing next week which is the same time as this hearing. I 
will probably be attending that meeting next week, next Thursday afternoon. The 
way the timing works at the Board -- there were four sponsors.  If one of the 
sponsors -- and I cannot remember the date, within a couple of weeks â If a 
sponsor pulls from being a sponsor, they pull their name from the ballot. But it 
cannot be changed, it can only be removed from the ballot.  And finally, I just 
want to say that next Wednesday, there is a ribbon cutting on Powell Street for 
another one of our Pavement to Parks projects that staff has worked very heavily 
on. It is where the cable car turns, effectively extends that first block 
through the street and creates some much more pedestrian-oriented area. Found a 
private sponsor to provide funds.  Staff has worked on this for a long time. 
That ribbon cutting is next Wednesday at 10:00 A.M., on Powell Street. That 
concludes my presentation.

COMMUNITY VISION FOR SAN FRANCISCOâS NORTHEAST WATERFRONT
 
- On July 8, 2010, the Commission acknowledged the work of Department staff in 
completing the Northeast Embarcadero Study and recognized the design principles 
and recommendations of the study for public realm improvements and new 
development in the area. At that same hearing, the Commission also urged the 
Port of San Francisco to consider the principles and recommendations of the 
Northeast Embarcadero Study when considering public infrastructure improvements 
in the study area. Separately, a citizens group prepared its own study entitled 
âA Community Vision for San Franciscoâs Northeast Waterfrontâ and has requested 
that they be given the opportunity to present their work to the Commission. It 
is this groupâs study that is the subject of this informational presentation.

AMERICAâS CUP AND JAMES R. HERMAN CRUISE TERMINAL AND NORTHEAST WHARF PLAZA 
BRIEFING
 - 


Informational Hearing
                  



-   
34
th
 
Americaâs Cup Project Description: 
The 34th Americaâs Cup project 
sponsorsâthe City and County of San Francisco (CCSF) and the Americaâs Cup Event 
Authorityâpropose to host the 34th Americaâs Cup (AC34) sailing races in San 
Francisco Bay. A series of AC34 yacht races would be held in San Francisco Bay 
in 2012 (Americaâs Cup World Series) and in 2013 (Louis Vuitton Cup, Americaâs 
Cup Challenger Series; potential Americaâs Cup Defender Selection Series; and 
the Match). Several of the venues proposed for the AC34 events are piers, water 
areas, and facilities managed by the Port of San Francisco (Port) including: 
Piers (Piers 19, 19½, 23, 27-29½, 26, 28, 30-32, and 80), water basins/water 
areas (Piers 9, 9-15, 17-19, 19-23, 23-27, 29‑31, 14-22½, 26‑28, 28-30, and 
32-36), and Seawall Lot 330.  Various other venues are proposed for 
spectator‑related activities, some of which are under the jurisdiction of other 
city, state or federal agencies, including Crissy Field, Marina Green, Fort 
Mason, Aquatic Park, Alcatraz Island, Fort Baker Pier at Cavallo Point (near 
Sausalito), San Francisco Civic Center, Union Square, and Justin Herman Plaza. 
The event venues would include team bases and operations, support space, media 
operations, hospitality services, sponsored commercial space, entertainment and 
spectator areas, and temporary berthing and mooring facilities for race-related 
and spectator vessels. Most of the facilities would be temporary and removed at 
the conclusions of the events, although certain permanent infrastructure 
improvements would be required at some of the proposed venue sites within the 
Port's jurisdiction. The proposed project also includes a number of 
implementation plans that address transportation management, waste management, 
parks coordination and management, sustainability, water and air traffic, public 
safety, youth involvement, and workforce development. The project would also 
require amendments to the Special Area Plan (SAP) adopted by the Bay 
Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC). 


- Cruise 
Terminal Project Description:


The Port of San Francisco proposes 
the development of Pier 27 as the James R. Herman Cruise Terminal and Northeast 
Wharf Plaza, which is proposed to be phased to allow proposed Americaâs Cup 
Village uses at Piers 27-29, including an initial phase of the cruise terminal 
building, for the 2013 Americaâs Cup races. The Cruise Terminal project would 
involve demolition of the existing Pier 27 shed, a portion of the Pier 29 shed, 
and Pier 27 Annex Building. The remainder of the Pier 29 shed would be retained 
and rehabilitated, and the Belt Line office building would be retained. Proposed 
improvements to complete the cruise terminal and wharf plaza would be built out 
after the AC34 races are concluded. The proposed two-story cruise terminal 
building would be approximately 91,200 square feet in size and would occupy a 
footprint of approximately 46,100 square feet along Pier 27. The Pier 27 cruise 
terminal would be designed to handle vessels carrying 2,600 to up to 
4,000 passengers. The cruise terminal would include an approximately a 3-acre 
ground transportation area, which would be located in the center of Piers 27-29, 
to support access, drop-off, and exiting by trucks, taxis, buses, and passenger 
vehicles to meet both ship provisioning and passenger loading needs of the 
cruise terminal. The cruise terminal would also accommodate other uses between 
ship calls, such as public or private gatherings, and maritime-oriented events. 
The Northeast Wharf Plaza would provide an approximately 2½-acre open space at 
the south end of Pier 27, fronting along The Embarcadero promenade and would 
include a multi-use recreational space containing natural turf; pavers, concrete 
seating/steps and planters; and ancillary structures for commercial and 
recreational services. The cruise terminal and wharf plaza project would also 
require amendments to the SAP adopted by BCDC.


   
Preliminary Recommendation: Informational only; no Commission action.
