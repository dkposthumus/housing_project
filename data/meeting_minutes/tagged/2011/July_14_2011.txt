Standards for Bird-Safe Buildings
 - The Planning Commission will consider two items: 1) a draft policy document titled "Standards for Bird-Safe Buildings" and 2) a proposed Ordinance that would amend the Planning Code to implement the proposed policy document. The actions are intended to a) reduce building-related hazards for San Francisco’s resident and migrant bird species; b) establish consistent building standards for creating bird-safe buildings; and c) provide certain exemptions from these requirements. The proposed Ordinance would amend the Planning Code to create a new Section, 139 Bird-Safe Building Standards; and would amend other sections, including Section 145.1; and adopting findings, including environmental findings, Section 302 findings, and findings of consistency with the General Plan and priority policies of Planning Code Section 101.1.


Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with modifications of a draft Resolution recommending approval of amendments to the Planning Code and adopting a Commission policy document titled "Standards for Bird-Safe Buildings".

SAN FRANCISCO SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROFILE AND CHANGE SINCE 2000
 - Staff will report on data from the Census Bureau, focusing on the 2005-2009 American Community Survey (ACS).  The annual ACS replaced the decennial Census “long form” and includes detailed socio-economic statistics such as household composition, income, poverty, educational attainment, occupation, and commute to work.  Annual ACS data is aggregated into five-year estimates to replicate Census sampling.  The 2005-2009 ACS is the first five-year estimate released and provides the most current socio-economic profile of the country.  Changes since the 2000 Census for select demographic and housing characteristics will be presented for San Francisco overall and by supervisorial districts; employment and commute to work will also be discussed.  Census 2010 data will be used when available.  Preliminary Recommendation: Informational presentation only. No action required
