950 Mason Street - Fairmont Hotel Project
 
- 
Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report - 
The project 
site is located at 950 Mason Street (Assessorâs Block 0244, Lot 001). The 
proposed project includes: 1) renovation of portions of the landmark 1906 
Fairmont Hotel building (City Landmark # 185), including consolidation of up to 
60 hotel rooms; 2) reconfiguration of some existing hotel uses; 3) demolition of 
the 1961 23-story Fairmont Hotel tower above the five-story podium; and 4) 
construction of a new 160âunit, 26-story residential tower and five-story 
midrise residential component, both above a five-story podium, on the site of 
the existing hotel tower and podium (proposed to be demolished). The proposed 
project would include below-grade parking for about 350 vehicles.  The 
113,400-square-foot project site is located in an RM-4 (Residential Mixed-High 
Density) Use District and the Nob Hill Special Use District (SUD), and in 200-E, 
300-E and 320-E Height and Bulk Districts.  The proposed project would require 
Conditional Use (CU) authorization for height and bulk and for a Planned Unit 
Development (PUD) including exceptions to the 25 percent rear yard requirement, 
as well as require Planning Commission approval under the âLarge Tourist Hotel 
Conversion Ordinance,â Administrative Code 41F.3(f), among other approvals. The 
proposed exterior changes to the historic 1906 Fairmont Hotel building would 
also require a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Historic Preservation 
Commission. The Draft EIR found that implementation of the proposed project 
would result in a significant unavoidable environmental impact on cultural 
resources, related to demolition of the Tonga Room, which has been identified as 
a historic resource under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).




Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the Final Environmental Impact 
Report.  




Response to the Planning Commission Draft EIR questions.
