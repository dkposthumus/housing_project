Commission Antonini:




I participated in a meeting last night at 2740 Mission Street 
with representatives from Pollo Campero.  Supervisor Campos was there as well .I 
think it was a productive meeting. People have a lot of questions about process; 
questions about differences between the categories of fast-food and formula 
retail. I think those meetings are very useful to understand what is going on 
and what to expect. I want to thank everybody who participated.  But I would 
also like to thank staff -- and there is no big rush on this -- if there is the 
ability to find out where the population density center of San Francisco is, I 
think it is interesting if we know geographically where the center of San 
Francisco is, but in terms of population in the District, it is probably 
available. That has a bearing on some of the things we consider as to where the 
densest parts of the City are. Finally: I guess, I believe we are in receipt of 
something from Mr. Ionin as far as the restaurants categories. I think that will 
be very helpful, because it sparked discussion last night and it is a little 
confusing. I mentioned it as being reconsidered and the categories will be a 
little less confusing since some of the things that were categorized as fast 
food might not be categorized as fast food and vice versa. Lastly: I read an 
article in the recent "Marina Times," and the author was Supervisor Farrell. It 
mentions that Facebook had considered one time relocating to San Francisco. I 
can check with him and others to find out more about this. It would be 
interesting to find out what sort of barriers might have existed to that 
decision and that could help us in our future decisions.  I will get more 
information on that.




Commissioner Moore:




As Commissioner Antonini was talking about clarification of 
restaurant uses, I would remind the Commission that last week, Commissioner 
Miguel was talking about retail -- retail pharmacy, retail what ever. It 
encompasses all uses from food to pharmacy to our hardware to whatever. I think 
we need some guidance on that.




Commissioner Olague
:





Yes, I think we had talked about that, getting more guidance 
- a work item on those issues that relate to retail. 




Director Rahaim
: 
  You are asking for what the existing definitions are and what types of uses 
they encompass? 




Commissioner Moore
:




Why are we using types that we are not familiar with, i.e., 
retail, pharmacy, as we have last week with CVS.  Note there are others coming 
up with larger mixes.




Commissioner Borden
:   I think if we are going to talk about that, what we want 
to understand is the impact on different types of retail. Not every type of 
retail has the same kind of impact. I think if we were going to break down the 
conversation that would be the more interesting thing to have. Obviously, if you 
have pharmaceuticals, maybe there is a different impact than if you have a 
clothing store. I do not know. I am just throwing it out there. Maybe there is 
not. I think if we're looking at ways to delineate the definition, we might want 
to look at what makes the difference. Maybe it is the hours of operation. Maybe 
it is the amount of waste they cause. I am not saying we need to change 
anything. I am just saying if we're going to look at retail, I think we should 
look at how different types of retail within that classification impact what 
neighborhoods differently. 




Commissioner Sugaya
: 




Just for the public's sake, we're talking about 
establishments like CVS Pharmacy, Walgreen's, which Commissioner Miguel voiced 
that in his opinion he did not know what they were. I think I know what they 
are, but maybe the code does not establish what they are. I think that is where 
the Commission is going, especially when we are talking about Target, or 
Wal-mart, or any of the larger 

establishments, and still have that mix - bigger than a department store.  You 
know what I mean. 




President Olague: 






Me and Commissioner Fong attended a brown bag lunch that was 
very well attended, and it is interesting. In the conversation the idea of 
manufacturing came up.  According to the census at least, a high percentage of 
those jobs come from here in the City. At the same time, I think there is an 
effort to retain those jobs and that type of business here in the City.  This is 
a non-profit called SF Made, and at the end of the month, they are going to be 
touring some of these local factories and that sort of thing, breweries, people 
who make garments and this kind of thing. SF Made -- that is the name of the 
group of people if you are interested. I think in June to July, we will be 
having a talk on local manufacturing. It is not something we should rule out of 
the talk about job creation and some of the other types of industry coming in. 
It seems to me there is still a lot of vibrancy and potential in manufacturing.





Commissioner Borden
: 




Your comments reminded me that in the paper it said the 
districts that would experience the most growth would be 2, 4, 6, 7, and 11. 
They have greater than the median norm of population growth. I was really 
surprised at four and seven. We do not have a lot of projects on that side of 
the City, along with six, which we obviously knew about, and 10, which we 
somewhat knew about. There is more development than we have approved there. It 
will be interesting to look at the census numbers, to kind of see if there was 
any growth and development in these neighborhoods or if there was more housing. 
It will be interesting to figure out why -- particularly 4, 7, and 11 had such a 
huge growth in their population numbers.




 


D.         DIRECTORâS REPORT

Directorâs Announcements




 




Director Rahaim:




Commissioners, I have one item to call to your attention. 
There is a memo regarding the Japantown Better Neighborhood Plan process, and 
there are community meetings coming up.  There will  three meetings: June 1, 
June 27, and July 31. They are all happening at 1840 Sutter Street at 8:00 in 
the evening. The community is looking at the details of plans that you had seen 
about a year-and-a- half ago. They are looking to add and recommend changes. 
These meetings will be held to get a broader community input on the plan. Again, 
the meetings will be June 1, June 27, in July 31.




Scott Sanchez, 
Zoning Administrator:




I just wanted to remark on the legislation sponsored by 
Supervisor Mirkarimi that has become effective. Residential units seeking a 
parking reduction would usually come to the Commission. That has been changed. 
Now residential and commercial parking â NCR districts â can be reviewed by the 
Zoning Administrator and reviewed against a set of criteria.  This is under 
Section 307.I.

We had a few applications submitted prior to this becoming effective. Some of 
those will not be coming before you because of the legislative change. Others 
will be coming before you because they required Conditional Use for other 
aspects of the project. We have a hearing next week and I wanted to inform the 
commission of the change. 




            




4.         Review of Past 
Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic 
Preservation Commission.




 




LAND USE COMMITTEE: 






§
        

BF various Parkmerced. 


This week the hearing at the land use committee focused on 
updates to the draft Development Agreement and technical amendments to the 
Planning Code ordinance.  There was little discussion.  After taking public 
comment and accepting the proposed amendments to the documents, the hearing was 
continued without action.  The Committee will consider action on the Parkmerced 
ordinances at a special Land Use Committee hearing scheduled for 9:00am on 
Tuesday, May 24.  At its full Board hearing next Tuesday, the Board will not 
only consider the EIR Appeal-- but also if the EIR is upheld, the Board will go 
on to consider all of the actions related to the Parkmerced project.




§
        

Housing Element.
  At Monday's land use committee hearing, the Board considered the draft 
Housing Element.   For this item, the     Board has already heard the appeal of 
the EIR and upheld the CEQA      document with a 8-3 vote.  Therefore this week 
the Land Use Committee      was able to take action on the draft HE.  The 
Committee heard public      comment that was largely consistent with comments 
made at the  Planning Commission hearing (some expressed concern that adoption 
of the housing element would result in a re-zoning of RH districts - staff 
clarified that this is not part of the housing element).  After public comment 
the Committee thanked staff for their work, asked staff to respond to public 
comments and clarify the effect of the housing element, and expressed support 
for the housing element; the committee voted unanimously to recommend adoption 
of the Housing Element to the full board.  The Board is scheduled to vote on the 
HE at next Tuesday's meeting.




 




FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:




§
        

New 
Legislation for 800 Presidio.  


Commissioners, on April 28th, 
2011 you heard legislation related to a proposed project titled the âBooker T. 
Washington Community Services Mixed Use Centerâ.  At that time you took actions 
approving the project with about 50 units of housing (including 24 low income 
units and 24 transitional housing units for youth at risk), a community center 
and a gym within a 55â height limit.  Since your action two new pieces of 
legislation have been introduced at the Board.  The first, was introduced by 
Supervisor Farrell.  It is an amendment to his original legislation for the 
project.  This new version would limit the height to 45â [BF110116, version 2].  
The second piece of legislation was introduced by Supervisors Mirkarimi, Mar, 
and Avalos [BF 110658].  This second, proposed Ordinance would allow a 55â 
building-- consistent with the project you have approved.  Since you have 
already considered this project, the Board has calendared both versions of the 
legislation without the typical 90-day wait.  Currently the Ordinances are 
scheduled for a June 6th hearing before the Board Land Use Committee.

CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MEDICAL CENTER (CPMC) LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN OVERVIEW




- This is the 
second of four scheduled informational hearings that will provide an overview of 
CPMCâs development projects. Specific topics to be discussed at this session 
include an overview of the architecture, urban design, and public realm 
improvements proposed at the Van Ness and Geary Campus, St. Lukeâs Campus, and 
Davies Campus, and an overview of the requested entitlements.
  
California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC) is made up of four medical centers in 
San Francisco, consisting of the California Campus (previously known as the 
Childrenâs Hospital of San Francisco), Pacific Campus (previously known as the 
Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center), Davies Campus (previously Ralph K. Davies 
Hospital), and St. Lukeâs Campus. Three of CPMCâs four acute-care hospitals 
(California, Pacific, and St. Lukeâs Campusâ) must be rebuilt or de-licensed in 
order to comply with state law about the seismic stability of hospitals. CPMC 
proposes to consolidate the acute-care services currently located at the 
California and Pacific Campuses, and locate them at a new medical center at Van 
Ness Avenue and Geary. The Van Ness and Geary Medical Center would include a 
hospital on the west side of Van Ness Avenue ((Block 0695, Lots 005, 006) and a 
new Medical Office Building on the east side of Van Ness Avenue (Block 0694, 
Lots 005, 006, 007, 008, 009, 009A, 010). The sites are bounded by Franklin 
Street, Post Street, Van Ness Avenue, Cedar Street, Geary Street, and Geary 
Boulevard.  At the St. Lukeâs Campus, CPMC proposes to construct a new hospital 
that will be located adjacent to the existing hospital tower on Cesar Chavez 
Street (Block 6576, Lot 021). The existing hospital tower on St. Lukeâs Campus 
(Block 6575, Lots 001, 002) would be demolished after the new hospital is built, 
operational, and patients have been transferred. In a subsequent phase, a 
replacement medical office building/expansion building would be built at the 
corner of Cesar Chavez and Valencia Streets. CPMC also proposes to reauthorize 
their previously approved Conditional Use for the Davies Neuroscience Institute 
(aka Noe Street Medical Office Building) located at 601 Duboce Street (Block 
3539, Lot 001).
