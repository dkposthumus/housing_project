CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MEDICAL CENTER (CPMC) LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN OVERVIEW
 
- This is the first of three scheduled Informational Hearings that will provide 
an overview of the project. Specific topics to be discussed at this session 
include an overview of CPMCâs Long Range Development Plan, their strategy for 
seismic compliance, and their healthcare delivery plan.
 
California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC) is made up of four medical centers in 
San Francisco, consisting of the California Campus (previously known as the 
Childrenâs Hospital of San Francisco), Pacific Campus (previously known as the 
Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center), Davies Campus (previously Ralph K. Davies 
Hospital), and St. Lukeâs Campus. Three of CPMCâs four acute-care hospitals 
(California, Pacific, and St. Lukeâs Campusâ) must be rebuilt or de-licensed in 
order to comply with state law about the seismic stability of hospitals. CPMC 
proposes to consolidate the acute-care services currently located at the 
California and Pacific Campuses, and locate them at a new medical center at Van 
Ness Avenue and Geary. The Van Ness and Geary Medical Center would include a 
hospital on the west side of Van Ness Avenue ((Block 0695, Lots 005, 006) and a 
new Medical Office Building on the east side of Van Ness Avenue (Block 0694, 
Lots 005, 006, 007, 008, 009, 009A, 010). The sites are bounded by Franklin 
Street, Post Street, Van Ness Avenue, Cedar Street, Geary Street, and Geary 
Boulevard.  At the St. Lukeâs Campus, CPMC proposes to construct a new hospital 
that will be located adjacent to the existing hospital tower on Cesar Chavez 
Street (Block 6576, Lot 021). The existing hospital tower on St. Lukeâs Campus 
(Block 6575, Lots 001, 002) would be demolished after the new hospital is built, 
operational, and patients have been transferred. In a subsequent phase, a 
replacement medical office building/expansion building would be built. CPMC also 
proposes to reauthorize their previously approved Conditional Use for the Davies 
Neuroscience Institute (aka Noe Street Medical Office Building) located at 601 
Duboce Street (Block 3539, Lot 001).





Preliminary Recommendation: No Action Requested - Informational Discussion Only.
