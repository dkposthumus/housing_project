B. 
PUBLIC COMMENT


 


At this time, members of the public may address
the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject
matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items. With respect to
agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when
the item is reached in the meeting with one exception. When the agenda item has
already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were
allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your
opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public
Comment portion of the Calendar. Each member of the public may address the
Commission for up to three minutes. If it is demonstrated that comments by the
public will exceed 15 minutes, the President or chairperson may continue Public
Comment to another time during the meeting.


 


?The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking
action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including
those items raised at public comment. In response to public comment, the
commission is limited to: 


(1) responding to statements made or questions
posed by members of the public; or


(2) requesting staff to report back on a matter
at a subsequent meeting; or 


(3) directing staff to place the item on a
future agenda. (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))


SPEAKER(S):


Richard Burke


- He lives in the Polk Street District.


- He is here for an item but apparently he can?t
address it directly.


- When he went out as the ?public? to try to get
support for his cause, he was told by the Planning Department that if he went
to a 3-block area and got 20% or more of the merchants opposed, he would then
be entitled to a conditional zoning hearing. Apparently, this is not true.


- He followed the rules as it was explained to
him to get a zoning hearing, and it never happened.


Norman Rolf - San Francisco Tomorrow


Re: Mission/Steuart Hotel


- He would like the Commission to not certify
the EIR because it has errors and misstatements of facts.


- It?s time to send a message to EIR writers that
they have to produce documents that state the facts fairly and accurately as
well as reports written with the welfare of the public as their first concern
and not that of a private, special interest.


- The Embarcadero Freeway was approved by many
government officials, yet later it was admitted to have been a mistake -- the
Mission/Steuart hotel might be one too.


Patricia Vaughey


- Design guidelines were written for
Telecommunications projects to protect the neighborhood.


- There is a project at Broadway and Van Ness
which is across the street from a school and senior housing. She would like the
Commission to look closely into the design guidelines on this issue because
this breaks all of the guideline principals.


Lloyd Schoegel


RE: 554 Mission Street


- This proposed large building is certain to be
disruptive to all the buildings including Golden Gate University which is
located next door.


- There is another large new building across the
street which is 23 stories high. There is a lot of underutilized office space
in the area. The priority should be to rent this under used space.


- At present, in the square block between
Mission and Market, there are at present 10 buildings, 20 to 40 stories high.


- The proposed project should be rejected.


Sue Hestor


RE: 2601 Mission Street/Bay View Bank Building


- This building is in a zone where you cannot
have a single use/space more than 600 sf (anti-chain store provisions) this
also applies to office space.


- The building is 90,000 sf, the landlord
removed all of the non-profits and Spanish media and rented it out to
Bigfoot.com


-There are pending applications, the only one is
to put more antennas on the roof.


- The organizations who were displaced were real
community-serving organizations and community-serving businesses.


- She would like to have a conditional use
hearing so the ZA can enforce the code on the building.


RE: American Can Company Buildings on Third
Street (American Industrial Complex).


- There was an article about this on the front
page of last week?s Examiner - The Panni Dolce eviction.


- The owner has decided to get rid of all the
tenants that face Illinois Street.


- These buildings are being emptied out. The
landlord is raising the rent as a way to get people out and put Dot.Coms in
there.


- Would like Commission to start regulating
things.


Jake McGoldrick - Richmond Community Association


- There is a problem with defacto demolitions
going on throughout the city.


- 269 Collins Street - This building is
undergoing an addition, yet the building is practically demolished.


- These buildings applied for permits to remodel
yet they are just being demolished.


- These types of things are becoming scandalous.


- There are other buildings that were supposed
to be rehabilitated and they have been demolished (710 10th Avenue).


David Osgood - Rincon Center Association


Regarding the EIR of the Mission/Steuart Hotel


- There are a lot of unresolved issues with the
EIR


- Would like to have Commissioners vote against
this project.

9. Commission Matters


Commission Joe:


1) She would like the Department to cooperate and
provide information requested by Mr. Joe LaTorre of the Mayor?s Office of
Housing so he can respond in 10 days.


 


Gerald Green (responded to Commissioner Joe?s
request):


The Commission took an action on 5/25/00 with a
+3-1 vote which meant that the motion to not take DR and not add any fee or not
require any action as suggested by the guidelines. The Commission opted not to
do so. Therefore, there is a +3-1 decision on a motion that did not include
referring this to the Mayor?s Office of Housing for a fee to be calculated. On
July 13, 2000 this case will come back to a full Commission to make a decision.


 


2) She would like a copy of the letter sent by
Mr. Joe Latorre of the Mayor?s Office of Housing.


3) She would like Department to look into the
impact of the relocation of the non-profits at the 2601 Mission Street Building
and the American Can Company.

lay-over yard for San Francisco Municipal Railway (MUNI) buses and proposed to
be leased my MUNI to the hotel developer who will lease the hotel to a hotel
operator.


Preliminary Staff Recommendation: Approval


(Continued from Regular Meeting of May 11, 2000)


SPEAKER(S): 


Michael Burns - General Manager of MUNI


- He is very please to present MUNI?s first
joint development project.


- This project grew out of a 1996 directive from
the Public Transportation Commission to explore opportunities for better
utilization of MUNI assets.


- This project has the potential for a very
attractive use of the project by being consistent with the mid-Embarcadero development
and the General Plan. This project has the potential to dramatically improve
the transit friendliness of the area and most importantly it will increase
transit usage to this part of the City.


- Issues that needed to be considered 1) What
are the MUNI transit impacts on employees and customers? 2) What are the
financial aspects of the deal? 3) What are the operational impacts?


- There will be 6 lines that will be relocated.
Three of the lines (21, 71, 7) are planned to layover on the eastern side of
Steuart Street.


- Two additional lines (9 - will layover on Main
Street and the 31 will layover on Mission Street just east of Main Street).
Just two blocks from the existing layover facility.


- Other lines (6 and 2) will be relocated to the
Transbay Terminal.


- There is consideration of a swap between the
21 with the 2 to provide a transit connection to the Sutter Street corridor
from the Embarcadero area.


- There will be no major impact on all the
lines.


- MUNI has about 2,700 customers serviced in
this area.


- There are very few people that use the layover
site as an origin or a destination.


- Most passengers access MUNI on Market Street.


- 82% of ferry passengers walk to and from their
destination.


- Improved connection to Market Street with the
F-line stop at the Ferry Building.


- Four Muni lines remain on Stuart Street.


- BART and MUNI Metro are easily accessible at
Embarcadero Station.


- Maintenances is light at the layover facility.


- The 14 Mission line was relocated out of the layout
facility about 7 or 8 years ago.


- There is no apparent difference in regards to
on-time buses.


- The operational impacts are minimal.


- Firmly believe that the development of this
project will generate income to the city.


- Significantly, under Proposition E, these
revenues are dedicated to MUNI.


- The developer will provide 1.5 Million dollars
for capital improvements for the area.


- This project provides many significant
long-term financial benefits for MUNI and the City.


(+) Chip Conley - Founder of Joie de Vivre
Hospitality


- The company has been in San Francisco for 13
years and they specialize in small, boutique hotels.


- They were selected about 2 years ago for the
project.


- They will provide many amenities for the
neighborhood : 1) a design concept which is complementary to all the variety of
the mid-Embarcadero projects that are occurring including the adaptive re-use
of the Ferry Building which allows for more weekend and nighttime activities.
2) Easy access to the new trolley ?F? line stop. They are funding the cost of
the trolley stop and free retail space to the non-profit Market Street Railway
Company for a trolley memorabilia retail shop. 3) Bathrooms (including
janitorial staff) for the MUNI drivers. 4) Enhancement of the art piece of the
ILWU. 5) Hotel will be union built and union operated. 6) A teen mentor ship
program and job training program for youth. and 7) a sidewalk cafe.


- This will be a transit-friendly hotel by
providing MUNI fast passes to employees, and BART tickets for guests from the
hotel to SFO.


(+) Clark Manus - Project Architect


- Site constraints include: Proposition K shadow
plane at Justin Herman Plaza South, MUNI vent shaft at northeast section of the
site, turn back tunnel structure which is underneath the site, the ?F? line,
the ILWU commemorative piece, and a piece of land that?s on the Embarcadero
side.


(+) Roberta Acktenburg


- She is here on her behalf and on behalf of the
San Francisco Chamber of Commerce.


- This project is a win for the City, MUNI, the hospitality
industry, numerous increases in jobs for San Franciscans, youth, the
Waterfront, and the quality of life in San Francisco.


- She will love to get on a MUNI line at her
home in Noe Valley and travel to the Embarcadero and enjoy the benefits that
these developers will provide.


(+) Ray Patlan - Local Artist


- He and 9 other artists were commissioned to
design a commemorative piece that stands on the corner of Mission and Steuart
Streets.


- This project will enhance the area not only
for the art peace but also with the other benefits.


 


Cathy Riggins - Embarcadero YMCA


- There will be adequate parking after the
construction of the hotel, which was a concern for the YMCA.


- She was happy to hear that passes would be
given to employees.


(+) Michael Dellar - Co-proprietor of One Market
Restaurant


- They have taken an active interest with MUNI.
They have had many meetings with MUNI and their consultants.


- As a neighborhood retailer, he is excited
about this project.


- All of the other food service establishments
are in agreement with the construction.


(+) Tho Do - Secretary/Treasurer of Local 2
Union


- The union supports the project because the
developer has respected the needs of union members, the new hotel development
will create many union jobs with many benefits to the members; they respect the
union to organize, etc.


- The ILWU sculpture will be permanently
displayed.


- Would like Commission to approve this project.


(+) Kelly Cullen - Executive Director of Tendorloin
Neighborhood Development Organization


- The neighborhood was amazed and delighted when
they opened a hotel in the tenderloin area.


- He has known the developer for many years and
knows that they have worked with the community.


- This project is a transit -friendly project.


(+) Jim Haas - Chair, Committee for Waterfront
Organ Pavilion


- Has been involved in the neighborhood for more
than a decade.


- Before the area was a layover for MUNI, it was
just a wasteland created from the 1958 freeway. The area was not very
attractive, therefore constructing a beautifully-designed hotel will improve
the area.


- The architect designed the hotel to be
compatible with the organ project.


- An EIR for the organ pavilion project will be
applied for right away.


- Would like Commissioners to support the
project.


(+) Sue Backman


- She has the largest retail tenant of the
Rincon Center which is directly across the street of the project. She is in
support of the project.


- In 1993, they were approached by the owners of
the Rincon Center to create a nighttime and weekend destination venue in a
neighborhood which closed early in the evening. Therefore, Chaulker?s was
created.


- There is much more activity and the
neighborhood is increasingly more dynamic.


- The hotel developers have address the parking
issues.


- MUNI can use the revenue which it will
receive.


(+) Jim Mathias


- Read a letter from Tom Redulevitch, BART
Director from District 9, which is in support of the project.


- Many joggers have plenty of room now to
peacefully jog and have a nicer view than a lot filled with buses.


(+) Ellen Kwan - Representing Chinatown
Transportation Research and Improvement Project.


- This project has been around for about 25
years. It was formed since the 1976 MUNI bus strike. TRIP has always been
concerned about transportation, with transit as number 1.


- This project is truly needed for MUNI to
increase their service and make service better.


- Although MUNI has to redirect their buses, the
benefits for MUNI are much greater than re-directing traffic.


(+) Jim Chapel - SPUR


- They have been involved in the redesign of
this neighborhood for about 20 years.


- They have wanted to get rid of that bus yard
and replace with something better and nicer.


- This is a way for MUNI to turn an underutilized
resource into income.


- Having private/public partnerships is the way
of the future.


- Hotel is the ideal use. It is the most public
of all public uses and requires very little parking.


- This is an ideal project all the way around.


(+) Charles Hardy


- He works at Boulevard Restaurant.


- He takes MUNI to work.


- The windows of the restaurant will show a
nicer view than the present lot.


(+) Frederick Hobson


- This project is in District 6 -
Tenderloin/Civic Center.


- Founder of an organization called People that
Care about San Francisco.


- His concerns have been answered.


- This project will have art growth, 


- This project will replace an ugly-looking
site.


- This project is union friendly and that?s nice
to see in the corporate world.


(+) Rick Laubscher - Small Business Owner,
member of the Board of the Market Street Railway


- They support MUNI?s operation of historic
transit in San Francisco.


- This project will generously provide income to
MUNI for improvements.


- They will have a location in the building to
serve as a Transit Museum.


- The relocation of the current bus lines will
serve public better.


- This development will be the most
transit-oriented project ever.


(+) Paul Zeiger - President of the local
marketing 


- This is a wonderful proposed project.


- They are constantly frustrated with the lack
of hotels in San Francisco.


- This will also be a visual benefit to the
area.


- This project will provide much needed income
to transit.


(+) Nancy Ellen - Lives at Rincon Center and owns
a retail store there.


- The busses provide odors and sloppiness to the
area.


- The structure will not block anybody?s views.


- Welcomes this addition to the neighborhood.


- Even though there are 2 other hotels in the
area, there is still much needed space for hotel guests.


(+) Doug Wright - 


- Read a letter of Rudy Nothemberg who served as
the City?s Chief Administrative Officer, General Manager of the PUC, and most
recently as the president of the Transportation Commission.


- Urges Commission to move forward on this
project.


(+) Kim Martinson - Executive Director of the
Transportation Management Association


- Confirms the commitment of the project sponsor
to become a member of their organization.


- She commends the developer for the effort to
offer MUNI passes to employees and BART tickets for guest.


(+) Ray Antonio - President of Transport Local
Union


- Represents MUNI operators.


- The issues brought up during construction and
post construction have been addressed.


(+) Ken Maylee - Long time user of the
Embarcadero


- Supports the project as it is, as well as the
project developer.


(-) Norman Rolf - San Francisco Tomorrow


- A previous speaker mentioned that they have
concerns on this project but in reality they are totally opposed. Citizens for
a Better District 6 are opposed to this project as well.


- Transit first is the city policy and is
established in the City Charter.


- This project will make MUNI operations more
expensive and more difficult, less in service reliability, and degrade
passenger ambiance.


- The lay over terminal should be improved
properly in accordance with the mid-Embarcadero plan.


(-) Michael Levin - 


- He is a 7 day a week MUNI rider, he is very
concerned about what happens with MUNI.


- He is not totally opposed to constructing a hotel
on this site yet he wants to be persuaded that this is a good project.


- He has great respect for the developer.


- The current design does not complement the
buildings in the area.


- There have been very poorly designed buildings
in the City.


(-) Dave Osgood - Representing
 
Rincon Center
Tenants Association


- There is no information provided to back up
the data on transit.


- MUNI has neglected this site.


- There have been a lot of letters written to
newspapers regarding concerns about traffic.


- There are many articles regarding transit in
the newspapers recently.


(-) Gerald Cauthen - Transportation Engineer


- He came to San Francisco about 30 years ago.


- He is worried about the infrastructure and
it?s ability to keep up with what is happening to the City.


- It is obvious that MUNI is barely keeping up
with the status quo.


- The key issue is the way the streets are
formed in San Francsico.


- It is advantageous to have an off street
facility.


- It is impossible to compare an ugly facility
to a beautiful hotel.


(-) Garret Jenkins - 
President of the North
Market Planning Coalition 


- The traffic impact will increase. 


- One of the reasons the Embarcadero Freeway
came down was to get a better view of the bay. There are 20 other projects that
are being planned on the waterfront which means that the open space will be
lost. There are restaurants being planned even closer to the bay which will
block the view even more. 


- The proposed hotel project will bring MUNI a
lot of money, yet if the corporate citizens really wanted to improve MUNI
service, they would accept a transit assessment.


(-) Lloyd Schloegel


- The most important aspect of this site is the
transit use. 


- This project is located in front of the Ferry
Building.


- The are many more hotels located around this
location therefore there is enough hotel space.


- MUNI should not be in the hotel business, it
should take care of its transit problems.


- This project should be rejected.


(-) Ron Mitchel - GLNB Worksite Committee Member
at Potrero Division for MUNI


- He is not here to talk about ?up? the hotel or
?down? the hotel. He is concerned about the planning of where the buses are
being parked.


- This issue has been talked about in various
GLNB Worksite Committee meetings he has been to.


- The 31 and 9 lines will be put on Main and
Mission. These lines are brutally heavy traveled lines. There is already a lot
of traffic at this location therefore would like to have these lines layover at
another location.


- One idea that came out of these Committee meetings
was having all the downtown trolleys go to the Transbay terminal and maybe
putting the motor coaches in another spot. Having the trolleys in one spot is
better for maintenance and switch trolleys if necessary.

a way that is contemporary.

of television, it is now time to bring back

worked in North Bach for 21 years.

1230 - 18TH STREET
, north side, between
Texas and Mississippi Streets, Lot 013A in Assessor?s Block 4001 -- Request for
Discretionary Review of BPA No. 9912693S, proposing to add a third floor to an
existing two-story, one-unit building, setting it back approximately sixteen
feet from the existing second story, for a height of approximately 37 feet.
Additionally, the applicant would construct a two-car garage, with two garage
doors, move the existing curb cut, and make interior renovations in an
RH-3(Residential, House, Three-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk
District. Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and
approve building permit application as submitted.


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Steve Williams - Representing the DR
Requestor


- There seems to be some confusion with the
height of the buildings.


- The project property is already larger than
the other homes.


- The staff doesn?t want to talk about the
adjacent buildings.


- There are two lot line windows facing east.


- There is a lot of room for compromise and
reduction.


- The project will cause a loss of a rental
unit.


- There is no additional parking being added.


- Would like Commission to reduce the project in
size.


(-) Gary Shawley - DR Requestor


- He had intruders come into his home twice.


- The proposed structure will be an invasion of
privacy.


- There is a petition from 85 of the neighbors
to reduce the project in size.


(-) Judy Shawley - wife of DR Requestor


- They have had intruders come into their home
twice.


- Why does the proposed construction have to
have a window on the lot line?


- They have tried to compromise to no avail.


- The project is huge and out-of-scale.


(-) Leland Van Winkle
 - 
co-DR Requestor


- He has a 6-unit building across the street
from the proposed project.


- He presently enjoys an open space feeling.


- The scale of the project is so great and out
of place. The two adjacent owners would have to build up to protect or maintain
their investments - removing his open space feeling.


-The scale gives the appearance that this
project would be built by a full time developer yet this project is being done
by a first time developer.


- The construction would remove rental units,
therefore, would be decreasing affordable housing in the City.


- He would like to encourage the property owners
to be patient and go back to their first choice and find the ideal house, even
keeping 1230 18th Street as an investment but without the need of this major
construction.


(-) David Luth - Mechanical Engineer


- The guidelines stress consideration on the
impact of adjacent buildings.


- This proposal should be brought down in size.


- There is a problem with the scale of the
building in regards to shadow effect on the neighbor?s house.


(-) Ed Schumer - 13 year resident of Potrero
Hill


- Project is out of scale to the rest of the
neighborhood.


- Would like to have modest modifications to the
proposed unit.


(-) Rebecca de Guzman
 
- Tenant of one of
the studios at 1297 18th Street


- She has been a tenant there since 1994.


- She is also a member of the San Francisco
Tenants Union because she has been concerned about the loss of rental units and
decrease of the quality of life to renters in San Francisco.


- She is against the project because of the loss
of family rentals.


- It has been brought up that MUNI has approved
this but that the garage would interrupt the MUNI bus stop.


- The building addition is out of scale and not
appropriate with the rest of the neighborhood.


- Would like to urge the Commission to consider
renters and the quality of life to residents of Potrero Hill.


(+) Robert May - Project Sponsors


- There was a secret brief that was sent out to
the Commissioners and he wasn?t aware of this. There seems to be many
discrepancies in this brief.


- The DR representative states that there is a
letter from a tenant who was evicted yet he has an e-mail from the same tenant
stating that he wasn?t evicted. 


 


(+) Robert Poyas - Neighbor
 
lives at 1206 18th
Street


- 10 years ago, he went through a similar
process of a neighbor making an addition to his home.


- The property owner came to him for advice on how
to go about doing this because he wanted to be sensitive to the community.


(+) David Teeters - Project Architect


- A lot has been talked about regarding the
residential design guidelines.


- There are buildings that range from 40 to 45
feet in height on both sides of the street.


- Regarding the scale of the building, no one
has suggested what exact scale would be appropriate.


(+) John Sweeney - 10-year resident of Potrero
Hill


- He is familiar with the review process since he
protested a proposed addition - he lost the appeal and none of his concerns
were taken into consideration. After the addition was completed, he realized
that his conception of the project was not correct and his concerns were not
ignored after all.


- A year later he went to apologize to his
neighbor.


(+) Sue Mell - Tenant at 285 Texas Street


- She has lived at this rental unit since 1995.


- Has no objections or reservations regarding
the construction.


- The DR requestors have never come to her to
get her opinion.


(+) Martha Cook - 


- She is co-homeowner of proposed project.


- There was a flier that was posted throughout
the neighborhood demanding they stop the construction of their monster home.


(+) Marsha Cook


- She is the mother of Martha Cook.


- She lives in Michigan and she will be moving
into the addition of the proposed project.


- This project has been delayed several times.


ACTION: 
Take DR to make changes proposed by
ZA: Property line windows to be removed, deck to be moved to the left hand side
of the building, move ladder to the other side of the deck if building code
allows

SPEAKER(S):


Donald Jans -

It is also ruining the garden

- His case came to the Commission
several months ago.


- The perpetrator appealed and took six
months in the appeal.

because the Board of Appeals lacks experience on this subject, the BOA
overturned the Commission?s unanimous decision.

ask Larry Badiner or the Chief Building Inspector to

rehear this case in front of the Board of Appeals.

Larry Badiner


Read the findings into the record:
The Commission took the action to deny based on 1) the potential for disruption
of transit service; 2) the potential for double parking; 3) there was no
demonstrated need for additional video rental service in the vicinity--an area
already well serviced by several other such establishments; 3) the recent
reduction from 3 to 2 traffic lanes and an the addition of bicycle traffic
mixed in with the vehicular lane would increase traffic congestion; 4)
substantial opposition expressed by neighborhood merchants and residents; 5)
the proposed validated parking would be valet style making it awkward for users
who might otherwise just double park; and 6) Polk Street is trying to establish
it?s character as a neighborhood commercial area of small local business and
there is a strong public sentiment that the proposed establishment would not be
compatible with that character.

-- 
Public Hearing on Draft
Environmental Impact Report.
 On Assessor?s Block 3776, Lots 119 and 62, the
project would demolish an existing building on the southeastern portion of the
70,400-square-foot project site, subdivide the project site into 12 equal-sized
air parcels, and construct a four-story, 55-foot-tall wood frame live/work
building on each air parcel.
? 
A total of
188 live/work units, occupying approximately 227,000 square feet, would be
constructed along with approximately 13,000 square feet of retail space for
four to six commercial tenants, which would be provided on the ground floor of
the two buildings with frontage on Fourth Street.
? 
A three-level underground parking garage would occupy the entire
site and would provide 188 private parking spaces (one per live/work unit), 292
public parking spaces, and 2 off-street loading spaces.
? 
The garage would be accessible on Welsh and
Freelon Streets in the middle of the project block.
? 
The project site is in SLI

District. 
Note:

Preliminary Recommendation: No
action


(Continued from Regular Meeting of
June 1, 2000).


 


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Stan Smith 
- Secretary/Treasurer of the San
Francisco Building Construction Trades Council 


- He would like to delay the EIR for
one week.
? 
He has reason to believe that
some of the transportation study is lacking.


(-)
 
Howard Strassner - Speaking for
the Sierra Club


- Read from Proposition E because it
directly affects the work of the Commission and the Planning Department.


- The Planning Department should not
encourage big parking proposals in areas well served by transit because parking
garages draw people off transit and into cars which then impede transit.
? 
Therefore, in two ways you discourage public
transit.


- One of the first directions in the
EIR is to discuss the alternative of a smaller garage--If you have less
parking, less people would drive because there is less places for people to
park.


 


 


(-) Lloyd Schloegle


- There is no need for housing here
because it?s not a residential area.


- There are too many proposals for
housing in these areas.


- This project is not necessary and
should be rejected.


(-) Sue Hestor


- This project is in the SLI district
and does not allow housing


- The growing demand for live/work
is the justification for this project.


- Live/work projects are now being
rented out to dot.coms.


- There should be an honest analysis
in this EIR which is the Department?s current version of office and call it
business services and analyze it as being used as dot.coms.


- Was this an arson fire, which
makes this site available?


- The traffic study is the biggest
problem.


- The project seems to incorporate as
a major mitigation measure something that the Commission has no power over
which is changing the street pattern.


-Would like to get another week
because this issue involves working with transportation consultants and 4
levels of transportation summaries have to be analyzed.


(-) Jennifer Clary - Board of
Directors of San Francisco Tomorrow


- She would like additional time to
comment on the EIR.


- She is extremely confused about
the policy of the department since they establish an industrial protection zone
and allow uses in it that are not allowed in it.


- She really would like time to
absorb it.










(+) Alice Barkley - Representing
Project Sponsor


- She would like the EIR to be
modified since the Department of Parking and Transportation is considering
reducing Zoe Street from a two way street to a one way Street southbound at the
request of some of the residents.


(+) Joe O?Donahue - Residential
Builders


- Years ago people were against
live/work because it wasn?t providing parking, now people are against live/work
because it is providing parking.


- This project is working for the
future.


- Sue Bierman gave her approval on
this site a few years ago.


- This is a good planning project.

SPEAKER(S):


Sue Hestor:


- There are about 450 units of
live/work in 3 projects.


- Does the commission monitor
occupancy in live/work projects?


- This project is next to the 6th
and Brannan on ramp/off ramp. It is a critical intersection.


- Is there a market need for all
these live/work projects?
? 
It doesn?t
seem to be--not if they are being occupied by dot.com companies.


Gary Moody:


- There are such a massive amount of
live/work projects in the area.


- These live/work projects are not
in compliance with state requirements.


- Things can?t be made up as we go
along.


- He has talked to state officials
and they will look into this and he believes that they will find that San
Francisco is not in Compliance.


- He has talked to HUD, the
inspector general?s office.
? 
These
projects are not in compliance with their guidelines either.


Lloyd Schloegle


- This proposal is in an area which
is zoned for service light industry and contains several active local
businesses.
? 
This is not a residential
area.










- From the security standpoint, it?s
not a good idea to build housing away from residential areas.


- The proposed area is a vacant
lot.
? 
This site would be better used as
a park.


Judy West


- Her project came up previously for
a rear yard variance.


- The issue is that in an industrial
area, people are building live/work because it seems to be the easiest to
build.


- People are not building
traditional housing.


- She thinks that in order to solve
the housing problems that San Francisco has,
?

requirements that are placed on real housing in industrial areas need to
be looked at again.


- No one should build residential on
commercial areas until the requirements on residential are looked at.


- There are places more appropriate
to build live/work.


Joe O?Donahue - Residential Builders


- He believes that 3,000 units of
live/work is far short from the 10,000 units that
? 
was authorized in the South of Market area.


- Live/work will house contractors,
plumbers, architects, etc.


- It would be much cheaper for the
builder to build dot.com to begin with than to convert the live/work to
dot.com.

site used to be a Victorian cottage.
? 
It
has now been rebuilt to a 3-story,
? 
3

because none of these permits went through Planning or the proper
channels.

the neighborhood when later someone else might want to build something similar
in height.

will make neighbors want to build as high.

heard a lot of allocations about what has happened in the past.


- If DBI required a permit for a
demolition, the law would be abided and the permit would be applied for.

RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk
District.










Preliminary Recommendation: Do not
take Discretionary Review and approve building permit application as submitted


 


SPEAKER(S):
? 


(-) Leona Storm


- Her property is adjacent to the
proposed property.


- There is a problem with limited
open space.


- The proposed construction will
cause lack of sunlight to her property.


- One of the problems is that
gradually the department is allowing for less sensitivity to small houses.


- There have been two additions to
the proposed property already.


- She will lose privacy both in her
back yard and two of the bay windows that face into this yard.


- They are increasing the number of
bedrooms by 4.
? 
It is not unlikely for
these rooms to be rented to students.


- Many of the properties around the
neighborhood rent to students which means that each renter might have a car;
therefore, making parking a bigger problem.


(+) Lisa Wong - Project Architect


- She has designed many residential
projects.


- She believes that this is a very
modest addition.


- The two story extension in the back
is legal.
? 
They are only adding another
13 feet past that.


- The project is only two stories
high.


- She tried to address all the
concerns the neighbors had.


(+) David Lee - Co-owns the property
with his father.


- His father lived in the home for many
years.


- The house is too small for another
live-in nurse to take care of his ailing father.


- When he gets married, he will need
the space for his family.

Take
Discretionary Review and approve a two unit building
 
with the following

Review of Building Permit Application No. 9824087, proposing new construction
of a mixed-used live/work and retail building, following demolition of existing
structures on the subject property.
? 
The
subject property is in an Industrial Protection Zone Buffer and a SSO (Service
Secondary Office) District and 65-X Height and Bulk District. The project
proposes demolition of two existing structures on the site and new construction
of a mixed-use live/work and retail building.
?

54 live/work units and approximately 14,600 square feet of ground floor
retail space is proposed.
???? 


Preliminary recommendation: Do not
take Discretionary Review and approve building permit as submitted.


 










SPEAKER(S):


(-) Sue Hestor


- She strongly disputes this last
minute interpretation.


- This project is 85,000 square feet
of live/work in an SSO district.


- This parcel was designated as SSO


- The floor plan is ideally suited
for office use since it has large spaces.


- This is an office site and it
shouldn?t be live/work.


(-)Jake McGoldrick


- If this is an office building,
then it should be approved as an office building.


(-) Gary Moony


- This project is 2 a block from
CalTrain as well as other sources of public transportation and environmental
agencies.


(+) Don Shaw - 


- When the owners came to him they
wanted a building that was mixed used with retail on the ground level and
live/work units above.
? 
They wanted the
building
? 
to fit into the existing
neighborhood --which consists of mostly renovated, industrial buildings built
in the early 20th century.
? 
These
buildings were usually either concrete frame or brick with industrial steel
sash windows.


(+) Salish Mahendra


- He read a letter from the 601 4th
Street Residents Association.


- They have had meetings regarding
this project and they agree with the general concept of the project.


- They had some reservation
regarding the aesthetics of the building.
?

They felt that the developers and the architects had good intentions to
try to make the building match the character of the neighborhood.
? 


- They made some suggestions at the
meetings and the owners have made a revised sketch of the building which meets
the suggestions.


(+) Peter Meyer - Project Sponsor


- He lives one block down the street.


- The owner?s across the street have
made a few suggestions but overall supports the construction. 


- This is a very substantial, nice
project.


 


ACTION:

Take Discretionary Review and approve project with
the following recommendations: 1) take the volunteer donation of $100,000
offered by Jim Reuben on behalf of his client for transit impact fees (to be
paid prior to the issuance of the permit); 2) do as Commissioner Chinchilla
recommended and have a Notice of Special Restriction placed on this project
that would put the world on notice that this has been authorized only as
live/work and not as office; and 3) that any conversion to office use would
require going through the office allocation process.

Review
of Past Week?s Events at the Board of Supervisors & Board of Appeals.


 


Larry Badiner


993 Tennessee Street


- This case was overturned by the
BOA +4-0.
? 
They felt that it was a mixed
neighborhood and that there were a variety of building types, building forms
and building uses.


- He seeks guidance and welcomes any
recommendations from the Commission on how to represent them.


768 El Camino - a Discretionary
Review


- The BOA upheld the Commission?s
decision +5-0.


535 Mission Street


- This item was withdrawn even
before it went to the BOA because the project sponsor upheld the Commission?s
decision.


2601 Mission Street


- The permits which have been
examined at this time are for some base building issues.
? 
Most of them are relatively minor.


- There are no tenant improvements
yet before staff.
? 
However, these
tenants improvements would be making changes to the size of the space or
converting uses.


- Staff will be doing a site visit
in the near future.


Live/Work Status


There are a number of reports
recently on conversion of live/work to offices.
? 
There have been 3 formal complaints from Ms. Sue Hester.
? 
Staff is looking into these.
? 
If they are reported, staff will
investigate.
? 
If they are illegal, or if
they require further permits or further environmental review, staff will pursue
them.


The conditional use abatement Language


This was before the Transportation
Committee and a concern was raised from the Restaurant Association.
? 
I, as Zoning Administrator, responded making
minor recommendations and changes essentially saying that the conditional use
abatement was not intended to extend the grounds for abatement but to clarify
the procedure for abatement.
? 
Also, the
Commission would be focusing on any abatement action on issues that were in
their subject matter jurisdiction only.

of BPA No. 9911578, proposing to demolish the existing building and construct a
new two-unit building in a RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District and a
40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Do not
take Discretionary Review, approve project.


Prior Action: Public comment was
closed at the February 17, 2000 hearing.
?

The Commission continued the item to allow further discussion between
the project sponsor and neighbors
.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of
May 25, 2000).


 


SPEAKER(S):


(+) John Rohosky - Project Architect


- He would like to request that the
Commission not take DR and approve the project.


- This is not a monster home as it
has been characterized and it is in character with the neighborhood.


- This project does not require a
conditional use permit or a variance.


- There have been many changes from
the original design (e.g. dropped the height to line with the adjacent
buildings, etc.)


- Every effort has been made to
respect Proposition M.


(-) Art Bender lives at 127 Randall
Street


- It is true that there have been
revisions made to the design.
? 
Yet, they
would like more substance revision.


- In his view the house still looks
like a monster home.










(-) Paul Curtis - lives at Fairmaunt
Street


- A 4-story building is out of
character in the entire neighborhood.


- The neighbors also have
endorsements from the Upper Noe Valley Association, The Glen Park Association,
The Noe Valley Democratic Club; District 8 Democratic Club.


(-) Andrea Wurland -


- At 158 Randall Street, there was
proposal for a large building yet it stayed within the character of the
neighborhood.


- This project is clearly deserving
of further review and a redesign.


(-) Anastasia Yovinopalus


- This is a good opportunity for the
Commission to set a precedent.
? 
Will the
Commission decide to make buildings higher without considering the neighbors,
the view, the character of the neighborhood, etc?


(-) Patricia Vaughey


- She believes that this project
could be revised more since there is enough space in the back of the house for
a deck instead of on the top floor.


(-) Paul Travis - Lives at 123
Randall Street


- There are other proposed projects
on the same block.


- If the Commission approves the
project, it will set a precedent and the other projects proposed on this block
will want to build as high or higher.


(-) John Murary - Lives on Chenery
Street


- His neighborhood has been in
existence at least 110 years without 4-story buildings.


(-) Jeff Mounce - Lives on Church
Street


- The neighborhood is not against
the construction, they would just like to reach a compromise -- it needs to be
smaller.


(-) Lory Stazacallis - Lives at 140
Randall Street


- She is not against having this
building built.


- The developer has not lived at the
proposed project, therefore, he has no sensitivity about the character of the
building. 


- She is opposed to the size and
dimensions of this building.


(-) Mr. Axit - lives on Whitney
Street


- He is aware of two buildings that
were built across from this project about 15 years ago.


- Both houses were considerably
small since at that time they were restricted.


(+) John O?Reily -Project Sponsor


- He has many letters in support of
this project.


- He has not ignored the requests of
the neighbors.


(+) Joe Anzer - He owns Real
Management Company of Noe Valley


- He has worked with the neighbors
and with the architect.
? 
They have
attended community meetings and every time there have been changes, the
architect has come back with revised designs.


- San Francisco needs housing and
new homes should be designed for the modern family.


(+) Jim Zack - neighbor


- He became involved in the project
when the neighbors sent him an invitation to attend one of their community
meetings.
? 
He wasn?t very impressed with
the tone the neighbors had against this project.


-This project is 100% code
compliant.
? 
It doesn?t require any
variances or anything out of the ordinary.


- If anyone wants to build and
develop their property they have the right as granted by the planning code.










- There is such a concern about the
developers who come into the neighborhood.
?

Cities need developers since if there were no developers there would be
no housing.

Review of BPA No. 20000121665, proposing to add a third story to the existing

Bulk District.

Preliminary Recommendation: Do not

?

SPEAKER(S):


(-) Lisa Fung


- A 3rd story addition would change
the character of the neighborhood since most homes are 2 stories.


- The addition of the 3rd story
would block view and light from the adjacent home.


- There are no good neighbor actions
from the project sponsor.


- The 3rd story should be
denied.
? 


- The project goes against the
neighborhood character.


- The planner stated that there were
no opposing neighbors and that is not true.


(-) Shirley Grey


- She is speaking on behalf of her
mother who lives next door to the proposed construction.


- The proposed construction will
block sunlight to her mother?s kitchen and breakfast room.


- Her mother?s stairway will be
right under the construction.
? 
It is not
fair for neighbors to deal with the noise of the construction.


- She agrees to all of the
statements from Ms. Fung.


- These homes are more like condos
since they are very close.


(+) Wilson Ng - Project Architect










- He is representing Mr. and Mrs.
Yap.


- He is proposing an addition of 2
bedrooms and 2 baths.


- The construction will be built in accordance
with all codes.


- He had meetings with planning
Staff and he addressed the 3rd story addition.


- There are other houses in the
neighborhood which have 3rd story additions.


(+) Michael Yap - Project Sponsor


- He and his family (5 total) live
in a 2 bedroom/1 bath home.
? 
They have
lived in this house for 16 years.


- He and is wife wanted to move to
another larger home.
? 
However, due to
the housing shortage, houses are priced higher than what he and his family
could afford, therefore, they decided to make an addition to his home.


- The first choice was to build
below but that was not structurally possible, then there was the 2nd
alternative to build behind the house but this was not feasible either because
it would cast a shadow on the neighbor?s home and that would also take away
from their daughters playing outside or weekend barbecues.
? 
So the only alternative was to build above.


- He talked to their neighbors about
the proposed addition, they seemed indifferent or said no without giving any
reasons.

- When you limit construction time,
the cost goes up.


- He lived at 25 Garden Street many

(-) Alan Kronsky - 1st DR Requestor
- lives at 553 29th Street


- He would like modification of the
design of the proposed project.










- He stood in front of the
Commission a few years ago when he wanted to add rooms to his home.
? 
His case was approved because he took into
consideration the opinion of his neighbors and the look of other homes in the
neighborhood.


- The developers will come and do
their construction and then leave.


- Sun and light will be blocked to
his home and the design just does not fit with the neighborhood.


- There were many plans and schemes
brought forward from the architect.
?

Yet, every time there was a new scheme items were eliminated and others
were added which made negotiations just stop.


(-) David Zovikian - 2nd DR Requestor

- The design of this construction is
completely out of character to the neighborhood.
? 
He doesn?t oppose the construction or development of the
neighborhood.


- He would like developer to
eliminate the 5th floor penthouse and 12 foot setback into the rear.


- The developer has no interest in
the neighborhood.
? 
As soon as this home
is built, the developer will move on to the next project.


- He has lived in his home for 10
years and has no intention to move.


- Million dollar condos do not make
a neighborhood.


(-) Jim Gordon
 - Lives next door of the property


- He approves of an RH-2 development
that is in scale with the neighborhood.


- Many people in the neighborhood
have built additions to their homes but nothing like the proposed project.


- The project is not in scale with
the neighborhood.


- The guidelines state that if
nothing helps then reduce the size of the building.


- The construction will block light,
air, and views to the adjacent neighbors.


(-) Amy Gordon


- The developers didn?t start
negotiations until November and they broke off negotiations the second week of
January.


- Their requirements have been the
same since July and they have been very honest and very positive about these
requirements.


- There have been many changes to
the plans, even last minute changes, yet there is still no agreement.


(-) Rob Rufner - lives at 436 Day

- Their situation is different
because they live in the back of the house.
?

Their kitchen window will look at the back of the proposed house.
? 
Instead of a blue sky and pitched roof
skyline, they will now be looking at a gigantic edifice.


(-) Howard Levit - Lives at 450 Day
Street


- Have lived at this house for 23
years.


- During these years, he has
witnessed many additions to homes that meet with the character of the
neighborhood.


- The two houses proposed meet all
the characteristics of a monster house.


(-) Anastasia Yopinopolus - Noe
Tenants Association and Friends of Noe Valley


- Where are the fire exits?


- There are fire hazards to the
proposed homes.


- Developers should size their
projects down.


- This project needs a second look.


(-) Peg O?Malley - Lives at 567 29th

- She and her family have added to
their home like many of the neighbors yet they have been respectful to the
neighbors and the neighborhood.


- The proposed houses will bring
incredible income to the developer when sold.


(-) Connie George - Lives 531 29th

- Her concerns are that the house is
out of scale to the neighborhood.










- There will be loss of light to
their neighborhood.

belt in the neighborhood.


(-) Robert Thomas - Lives at 546

on in the neighborhood if this project is approved, more people will want to
build without consulting the neighbors.


(-) Mark Tully - Lives at 610 29th
Street


- He was shocked and aghast to see
the demolition notice at the proposed site.


- All the neighbors have joined to
demand a downsizing of this project.


(-) Mary Arguelles - Lives at Noe
and Day Street


- This is a group of people that
want to work together and prove that they can do that.
? 
Most people have either planned a project,
been through a project and added on to their homes and it works and now they
are all raising their families there.


(-) Vicky Rosen - President of Upper
Noe Valley Neighbors


- This is about respect for people
and where they live.
? 
It?s about
preserving the environmental quality of where people live.


- She feels that it?s really
disrespectful for developers to not try and honestly work with people because
the people are who will remain long after the developers have gone.


- It is very important to keep with
Proposition M.


(-) Celeste West
? 


- She recommends that plans be
reworked to be compatible with neighborhood buildings.


- Please consider the earth and all
the creatures.
? 
Do not allow for land to
be exploited by massive floor plans.


- Please support humanity?s deep need
for buildings designed with love, imagination, playfulness and humor.


(-) Marilyn Heiss - Lives at 650
29th Street


- She and her family have lived
there for 8 years.


- The housing market at the time
they bought their home, wasn?t as it is now and they had a choice of where to
live.


- They are not against the
development but developers should not be able to overwhelm everything around
them.


(-) Paul Curtis - 


- He came to the hearing to oppose
129 Randall Street.
? 
The proposed construction
is a few blocks away from his home so it is still his neighborhood.


- The proposed home will make the
neighborhood be out of character.


(-) Connie Fangled - Lives at 540
29th Street


- She has leukemia and stays at home
a lot.
? 
The thought of going thorough
the construction is overwhelming.


- Her tenant has threatened to move
out because of the hardship the construction will cause.


(-) Rick Berman - Lives at 511 29th
Street


- 
The name of his wife was listed as supporters of the
project.
? 
The behavior of the developer
in compiling a list of neighbors in support is deceptive.


- Adding buildings that tower over
29th Street is a disservice to them.










- Their experience with this
developer is unwillingness to consider the intent of the Residential Design
Guidelines.


(+) John Sanger - Sanger & Olson
 
- Representing Project Sponsor










- There aren?t any insertions in the
communications to the Commissions with neighborhood support for this
project.
? 
What was presented to the
Commission was a survey of the neighborhood opinions.


- They took very seriously the staff
comments and changes.
? 
Just yesterday
they were able to provide a response to all the neighbor?s comments and staff
recommendations.
? 
He realizes that staff
hasn?t been given enough time to analyze these changes, therefore, would be
willing to propose a continuance.


- 6 schemes have been developed yet
they haven?t been able to satisfy all of the neighbor?s needs.


(+) Joe O?Donahue - Residential
Builders


- This conflict is about the recent
intrusion of AMonster Homes@.


- This is a very modest proposal.


- Cassidy Construction has never
sold any of their buildings for rental.


(+) Shawn Gorman - Project Architect
 
- Gary Gee Architects


- There were many schemes to try to
meet the issues the neighbors brought up. 


(+) James Ninemacker - one of the Project Sponsors
???????????????????????? 
-
There are other buildings that are larger with penthouses and lesser setbacks,
only at certain angles can you see the penthouse.

needs to alter the permit or seek a justifiable variance.

This position
is needed to meet the demands and increase in responsibilities resulting from

-There are a number of

seeking additional funding for the Transit Oriented Studies that are being

11.
????? 
Staff report on
whether or not the Commission has authority, under the Discretionary Review
process to impose exactions such as affordable housing and transportation.


 


Gerald Green:


- Currently the
Commission has the ability to require projects to mitigate certain impacts in
the following ways: under the conditional use process, the Commission
implements the inclusionary housing policies; under the affordable housing program,
the Commission is able to provide an exaction from office development which
goes to affordable housing fund, transit impact fee, child care and open space
in certain districts.
? 
Currently, this
is not imposed using the Discretionary Review process. Normally, the Commission
has the responsibility of acknowledging that there is a direct relationship or
nexus between the impact of a project and the condition which is imposed.
? 
The Commission does acknowledge that a
certain project does create additional demands on housing, transit, etc.
?? 
Ms. Boyagen of the City Attorney?s office
will expand on this issue.


Judy Boyagen


- The general principal
under Federal and State law, is to impose a monetary fee or other type of
exaction that requires the showing that there is a connection between the
impact of the project and the conditions
?

imposed to mitigate that impact.


- Under state law that
is actually codified of the government code starting at Section 6600.
? 
It actually sets forth a nexus requirement
and accounting reporting requirements.


- The funds have to be
segregated, accounted for, reported to the people that contributed and a return
of the money if it is not used for the purpose it was collected.










- There is no major
legal difference between a fee and exactions through legislation or through the
Commission?s discretionary powers..
?? 
It
is still the same requirements.
? 
Through
legislation, you have the opportunity to do the study which will demonstrate
the nexus and set the appropriate fee.


- Under state and
federal laws the fee of the impact has to be proportional to the impact.


- It is difficult for
the Commission to do this on a case by case basis.


- The Commission does
have the authority to impose compliance with future legislation (Russ vs. San
Francisco).


- In Conclusion, I [Judy
Boyagen] believe that legislation is preferred but if the Commission complied
with all the legal requirements, it can be done under the Discretionary Review
power.


Gerald Green:


- There have been some
projects where there has been a nexus study.


- There is a nexus study
being prepared for the expansion of the transit impact fees beyond the C-3
districts.
? 
It will be available to the
Commissioners in the near future.


- The Commission does have
a right to put a Aplace holder@ condition on certain projects.
? 
It should be determined before what kind of
projects and at what scale these projects should have conditions.


- Another option would
be for the Commission to develop a policy in which conditions on a general
basis would be imposed from a project where the relationship of the impact
would require it.


- Staff is preparing a
nexus study to allow for the expansion of the transit impact fees beyond the
C-3 Districts which will be availabe in the near future.


- In July, staff will
begin to brief the Commissioners on the appropriate steps to take
? 
to address the interim controls that have
set up the industrial protection zones.


Sue Hestor:


- One of the things that
is missing from this issue is the role of environmental documents.


- Before these fees were
imposed on projects, environmental documents played a key role in determining
the impact on housing and transit.
? 
This
eventually set the basis for the implementation of these fees.


- The Commission has
more responsibility now.
? 
The Commission
has to demand that the EIR?s generate adequate information.


Joe O?Donahue - Residential Builders


- There is a housing
crisis right now on housing and live/work.


- Live/work is functional
zoning


- Privatizing MUNI would
make the department more efficient.


- They proposed to the
Board Of Supervisors on EIRs--that they include socioeconomic impact analyses
as part of the reports.


John Bovis


- There seems to be a
need to expand the authority of the Commission and try to exact some penalty
from projects.
? 
He suggests that the
Commission come up with clear legislation that describes the authority the
Commission would like to have.


- It is a good idea to
write good environmental impact reports, therefore, there is a good basis from
which to proceed. 


Joe Cassidy - Residential Builders


- They have never sued
anybody.


- They do not advocate
or threaten Lawsuits.


 










ACTION:
? 
Continued to July 20, 2000 - for further discussion
which would allow the additional contribution of absent Commissioners and could
ultimately lead to an action by the Commission.
? 
A resolution should be drafted which sets forth the Commissioners
reasons for considering this policy and what the actual policy will be.


This item will be calendared under Director?s Report.

an appearance of a small neighborhood.

located right in the middle of the building, where the light well is.










- She went to the
PG&E Energy Center to get a light study.
?

This is a study of the sun and shading patterns.
? 
It can show how the sun will shadow for a
particular time of the day during the year. 


- She showed pictures of
the impact the addition would have on sunlight being blocked onto their light well.


(+) Corey Reed - Project
Sponsor


- This is not an
exceptional case.
? 
There is no
significant harm to the neighborhood nor is it out of character to the
neighborhood.


- The issues the
neighbors seem to have is the sunlight being blocked.


- There is no impact on
anyone?s view.


- In respect to the
character of the neighborhood--there are several buildings that are different
in shape, size and look.


- There are a couple of
improvement projects proposed on this street.


- The size of the immediate
neighbor?s light well is quite large.

- Although this is in an
RH-2 District, there are 8 single-family uses.
?

Single- family uses are smaller in scale.

that the 4th story that is proposed is out of scale and out of character to the
neighborhood.


- They would only like
to have the building scaled down since they are not against the addition.


(-) Dennis Kelly
 
- Lives on Geary
Boulevard


- There are no 4 story
buildings in the neighborhood.


- 3 stories seem to fit
into the neighborhood.

do damage to the neighbors and the neighborhood.

This
construction will block their light as well.
