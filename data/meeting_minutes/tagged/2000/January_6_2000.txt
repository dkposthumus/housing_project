    space and 128 residential units with a revised total of 126 parking spaces 
    accessed from Page Street in an 80-foot high new building at 55 Page and through

SPEAKER(S):
(-) David Snyder, Exec. Director, San Francisco Bicycle 
    Coalition 
-- traffic gross is estimated to be at .5% compounded annually

    1.1% and that is over a time period that there weren’t any traffic changes 
    as a result of the Central Freeway. The traffic pattern in the area, was practically 
    stable during the time period. This data is reliable. Traffic on Market Street, 
    showed similar increases. Over 13 yrs., the difference between a 1.1% and 
    a .5% is a difference between 6.5% and 15%.





    (-) John Suisky 
-- would like the developer to reduce the number of parking 
    spaces. Encouraged the department to re assess requirements in areas like 
    this.

(the

                          Alice

  anything that would end up as being a constructive eviction. As long as those 
  conditions are met, do not have any problems with continuance.
