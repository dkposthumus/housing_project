REVISION TO THE CONDITIONAL USE ABATEMENT
PLANNING CODE AMENDMENT
,
Consideration of a revision to a proposed amendment to the Planning Code
previously initiated by the Planning Commission and recommended for adoption by
the Commission on October 7, 1999 but not heard by the Board of Supervisors.
That proposal and this revision would amend Section 303 to clarify the appeal
delay in the effective date of a conditional use approval and to provide a
process for abating conditional uses which violate their conditions of
approval, are in violation of the law, or have become a public nuisance. 



  


After Planner presentation:
 

  


COMMISSIONERS COMMENTS:
 


Commissioners Chinchilla: 
Do you have written text that have all the
modifications that you had suggested?
 


President Theoharis,
 an important issue, if there any new evidence that
comes up, is confusing, she need to see new language and was no in the position
to read it right there, need more time to read it.
 


Commissioner Antenore: 
In the original consideration at the Bd. Of
Supervisors, they inquired whether was formal or informal to delete the
language that permitted appeals by tenants as supposed by simply property
owners. How do that occurred? How that change took place in the legislation.?




Commissioner Richardson: 
How soon they can get new language. If this is
confusing to us. How do you expect the public to grasp and make the proper
comments? Public need to know exactly what they are commenting on.
 

  




SPEAKER(S): 
 


Deborah Stein, GCA, 
had some comments on the issue of frequency, section
303e does required that the process for modifications and conditions must be
the same procedure not a different procedure, as issue on use of the initial
conditional use authorization both as to notice and also it will required the
same procedure as a frequency. The procedure for frequency for consideration of
conditional use authorization it has been rejected, can not come back with that
same project, week after week, to reiterated the same series of hearing,
however, if you come with a new project with substantial new evidences and
issues that were not preciously considered, that can be considered sufficiently
an issue, to allow a project/conditional use application to be submitted within
than 12 months. With re: conditional use abatement it should follow the same
procedure which it is that the decision by this Commission or if is appealed by
the Bd. Of Supervisors should final and no subject to subsequent additional
reviews, unless the Director determine one there is substantial new evidence
about the same conditional use abatement issue that was considered, but it
raises new issues that were not originally considered, or evidences of a
different conditional use abatement.
 

  


Commissioner Antenore: 
In the past when we deal with abatement questions that
they tend to drag out of period time and we tried not to take rakonian actions
in the early stages of a case. Bring cooperation on part of the property owner,
who might be violating conditional use rather than jump into some severe
action. Your suggestion make difficult for us to use our judgment in dealing
with the situation as evolve for a period of time and really tied our hands in
a way that give us a sort drastic choice of doing strict enforcement of an
abatement proceeding versus of doing nothing and be stuck without an ability to
deal with it again in future months. Peoples behavior in these kind of
situation. some time difficult to judge, need to do investigations we tend not
to able to make that kind hard and fast up and down decision. Your suggestion
is unwise.
 

  


Debra Stein: 
The careful incremental consideration of abatement
issues can be very lengthy. The Commission over a period of month would reach
the determination, that either after careful consideration of evidence there is
not violation of conditions or that has been a violation, so the Commission
determine that violation has been abated, in other words, as some point at the
end of the lengthy process, would be a final decision could be appealed. The
issue of resubmission of frequency of reconsideration of abatement items, is
not any way to suggest that has to be dealt with the public hearing, is at the
discretion of the Commission to look over period of time and tried to work that
out. And when the Commission reached their final decision, there is violation
but we believed is been abated.
 


Commissioner Richardson: 
Asked Mr. Stein, to submit comments in writing for
further consideration.

10. 1999.533ET (ROSETTER)
 


CHILD-CARE OPTION AMENDMENT,
 Amend Section 314.1 and 314.4 of the Planning Code to
allow a developer to satisfy the child-care requirement by entering into an
arrangement pursuant to which a nonprofit organization would provide a
child-care facility at a site within the City. 
 

  


After Planner presentation:
 

  




SPEAKER(S): 
 


John Bardis: 
Is very interesting, to see that something that is a
requirement for downtown office developers, to have childcare facility for the
employee inside the building, can be in effect pass off and avoided and
therefore that space be use for commercial which probably could be more
valuable than have tied up with kids, by making a payment to the City. Now they
are not satisfied with that avoidance, basically they are saying, don't want
that facility within a mile. What are we doing here in terms of the primary
objective, of what this ordinance was supposed to accomplish. Then, if it goes
beyond a mile, a non-profit would provide this service not the developers and
we pay them for doing it, but then the non-profit take over existing housing
stack, and take over housing from the people of S.F. to take care of the
commercial need that is going to satisfied downtown. How do we reconcile that,
with what we just did, in terms of a gift in the first place.
 


Michael Burk, National Office Partners, 
support this amendment that was introduced by Sups.
Berman and Tang, who noted their interested for childcare. The reason we
support this amendment is that provide an additional opportunity for developers
in downtown to meet the needs for childcare in San Francisco.
 


Ellen ___, Assistant Director, Planning
with the Department of Children and ___ 
express
her support .

1. The reference to transit was to be
eliminated. The exact phrase is, "...that is reasonably accessible to
public transportation." There were two places where this phrase remained.
The first is Page 1, Lines 6 & 7 and the second location is Page 5, Line 8.
So, in those two locations; please delete, "...that is reasonably
accessible to public transportation."
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
 


2. On Page 11, at the beginning of Line
22, please add the following language, "...Needs Assessment and will be
consistent with the City Wide Child Care..." When this is done,
Subparagraph (F) should read, in part: "The Department of Children, Youth
and Their Families has determined that the proposed child-care facility will
help meet the needs identified in the San Francisco Child Care Needs Assessment
and will be consistent with the City Wide Child Care Plan; provided..."

PLANNING CODE AMENDMENT: MISSION ALCOHOL
RUSD EXCEPTION FOR GROCERY RELOCATION
.
The existing Mission Alcoholic Beverage Restricted Use Subdistrict (RUSD) which
is bounded by 14th Street, Potrero Avenue, Cesar Chavez Street and Guerrero
Streets, prohibits any new establishment selling or serving alcoholic beverages
within that district, but makes an exception for bonafide restaurants. The
proposed amendment would allow an existing grocery store to transfer its liquor
license to elsewhere within the RUSD, provided, 1) that it would be for the
same type of license as held at the prior location; 2) that the grocery store
had this license since before the effective date of the Mission Alcohol RUSD;
3) that the store relocation occurs within 24 months after the effective date
of the Mission Alcohol RUSD; 4) that the new location is within 500 feet of the
prior location; 5) that the proportion of the floor area devoted to alcohol
sales at the new location will not be significantly increased; 6) that alcohol
sales are abandoned at the former site.

BRYANT SQUARE PROJECT
, Public Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Report
. On Assessor's Block 4080, Lots 7, 11, 12, 13, and
14, the approximate 166,815 gross square foot project would include
construction/renovation of about 152,600 gross square feet of office, about
9,550 gross square feet of retail, and about 4,700 square feet of light
industrial after demolishing about 34,000 square feet of offices, light
industrial, and arts-related uses in three structures and renovating two
existing structures. The project site is in two Use Districts: M-1 (Light
Industrial) and C-M (Heavy Commercial), and is in a 65-B Height and Bulk
District.
Note: Public comments will be accepted from November 20, 1999, to
January 6, 2000 at 5:00 p.m. or the close of the Public Hearing before the
Planning Commission, whichever is later.
 

  


After Planner presentation:
 




SPEAKER(S): 
 


Tom Wetzel, 
lived in the Mission since 1981, his basic problem
with this project, is that the project is in violation transit first policy. It
will provide of hundreds of off-street parking spaces, which will encourage
people to drive, having this high tech employee driving with their SUV,
invading his neighborhood daily, and you are providing zero amenities for
pedestrians and transit users. 
 


Steve Hortland, 
gave a different point view re: traffic problems.
Anticipated that this project would have almost 600 people would working in
this building and they only providing 100 spaces. People already parking on
sidewalks, double-parking. Where the rest of these 500 people is supposed to
park?
 


Mr. Liken, Director, Awakening Dream, Non-Profit.

Neighborhood should stay with light
industrial. Project like this are better situated around China Basin.
 


Peter Sutherland, 
11 year resident of this neighborhood, report didn't
take in consideration the overall development of the neighborhood. It is very
important that somebody does a complete study on the accumulative effects of
development in the neighborhood. Also the project, is one the most important
project that ever is going to be done in S.F. for the simple reason, basically
you are bringing downtown bldgs.,structures, and melding with San Jose type of
architecture into a various establish and very old neighborhood in the
City. 
 


Jule Nemeyer, 
concerned about the height of the proposed bldg., is
out character with the neighborhood.
 


Batel Libes, 
concerned about the lack of disability parking spaces.




David Malte, 
opposed project.
 


Giselle Perez, 
business owner in the neighborhood, this is a heinous
monstrosity project, the residual effects are going to be long term, it will change
this neighborhood forever. This building is inappropriate.
 


Joshua Collins, 
commented in the visual quality of the project. How it
will affect the community.
 


Jonathan Youtth, 
encouraged the personnel from SKS to read about
community development and think about the process and redesign this project
with the input from the neighborhood.
 


James Cochran, 
in concurrence with the former speaker. The most
important issue is the social impact in the community.
 


Terry Matelson,
 Keep the character of the neighborhood intact. 




Mary Benneth, 
considered all the noise during construction, traffic,
size of the project, parking, etc.
 


David Jaymes
, Please do not allow approval to this project. The
height of this bldg., will create a shadow that will block direct sunlight and
views for numerous existing property, parking congestion; also do not believe
this project is gear to the artistic or industrial population, which currently
occupied this space.
 


Andrew Hope
, designer, engineer, artist. Opposed project. 




Samon Eastwood
, concerned for the people that didn't attend the
meeting. This building does not fit the neighborhood. It will put the
neighborhood in the darkness.
 

  


Sue Hestor, S.F. Reasonable Growth
, on pg. 2-4 for the project description, wanted a displacement
info., very specific exact name of business they were in this bldg., what
product do they produce?, were they women/minorities owner?, how long were they
there?, what rent do they paid?, all the descriptions that what had been there,
which is been eliminated is grossly general, need to be more explicit.
Throughout the entire doc., including in these pg., every time the staff use
the word "office" is use, the staff should say whether is legal
office within the term of prop. M accessory offices in a manufacturer facility
are not office, the City is using the term office much too loosely to get the
impression that this is just a continuation of former legal office use. Every
time you describe the height of the Bldg., with floors give in feet as well. On
pgs., 2-5, and 2-6 where you have the drawings of the bldg., should have the
street address on every single of the bldg. On pg., 2-12 project sponsor
objector: 1) should be the honest "make a lot money", they are not in
this as a charitable enterprise, they don't care about sustaining the historic
urban. Their goal is to make a lots money. On pg., 2-14 this is another place
that the office issue be pull out and talk about. Prop. M, changed the
definition of office. Pull out the exact language of Prop. M, priority policy,
because of the policy of the votes of the City more than the general plan
policies are, they are higher than that. On pg., 3-2; do not discussed about
the pending rezoning. On pg., 3-4; put down rental houses, rental versus
ownership. 
 


Jake McGolde
, made reference to sec, 5.1, parag. 3.
 

  


STAFF COMMENTS
:
 


Commissioner Richardson
: The EIR addresses long term Env. Impact. There is
nothing that addresses the temporary Env. Impact (noise, traffic, dust).
Requested the Director to help her to understand why? Because she had some
suggestions, that would help to mitigate the adversity part on the residents of
the community.
 

  


Gerald G. Green - Director Planning:
 Comm., Richardson, if you like to see a discussion
w/re: to impact that are related to construction, if you think that the
discussion is adequate or you going to make a determination that there is no
discussion at all, you need some. I do believe that every Env. Impact Rpt.
Clearly talks about what transpire during const., in section 4 of this doc. ,
does talk about construction. My suggestion of help you to shape your comments
would be that if you by looking sec. 4, that is not an adequate discussion
about the impact related to construction.
 

  


Commissioner Antenore
: Bldgs., of this size and nature the impact that was
going to have in the neighborhood that is already very impacted, having a lots
problems, many of them particularly in re: to transit for the area, parking,
general transportation issues, needed to see the mitigation section in the
EIR., to see what proposals there were for dealing what I could see was really
an impact. All mitigation proposals except one relay solely to the question of
construction impacts and the one mitigation measure that was considered and
didn't relay directly construction impact was simple to change the timing on
one traffic light in one intersection, and that is the only mitigation measure
that stated to be need for projects like this in this EIR. The justification
for that is that again, back to the old question of cumulative impact, that we
see every EIR., is that we don't need to consider this mitigations because the
specific impact of this project is not incremental great enough to justified us
having to mitigate the impact. In every EIR on top of every EIR say the same
thing about this question and we never get to overall issues. This issues can
not be swept under the carpet so easily by saying that this particular project
does not add cumulative impact to justified us to deal with it, we have to get
to the point to deal with real issues that affect people. This area of S.F., is
obviously impacted in some many ways socially, environmentally, economically,
transportation, every issue you could think of it practically in terms of urban
planning.

333 DOLORES STREET
, The Children Day School, east side between 16th and
17th Streets. Assessor's Block 3567, Lot 57, a portion of City Landmark 137.
Request for authorization of a Conditional Use to expand an existing elementary
school from pre-school through fourth grade to include pre-school through
eighth grade, as well as to construct a new school building which would contain
classrooms, administrative offices and a multi-purpose room, in an RM-1
(Residential, Mixed, Low Density) Zoning District and a 40-X Height and Bulk
District.
 




(Continued from Regular Meeting of December 9,
1999).
 


Note: On October 28, 1999, after public
testimony the Commission closed public hearing. Commissioner Chinchilla was
absent. 
 

  


After Planner presentation
:
 


President Theoharis
: Expressed that her main concerns that the neighbors
that were not notified and does was not enough reach out. A lot of the
surrounding neighbor are concerns about traffic and the mitigation measures are
been put in place, are in good faith and will be very beneficial. They were
concerned about 6
th
, 7
th
, 8
th
 graders coming
into the school, the irony of that, is when you read the report, because this
bldg., is 75 yrs., old the preschool would end up be wash, they could retain
the preschool. Also think having older kids, could be beneficial to the
community and create a very positive harmonious situation. 
 

  


Commissioner Richardson
: the Commission actually had gone beyond the color
duty by kicking the project back and forth to allow community input
participation, the dilapidation of state of our schools, both in the private
and public sector, one thing is to talk info., age, and the other is to see at
the middle aging infrastructure that we have in our schools in our country. It
seem to me that it is a great and an urgent need to provide environment to
conditions to learning both physically and academically. All comments, meetings
and conceptions that took place, I strongly agreed with the staff in the motion
and all the conditions that are proposed and agreed with the project sponsor.
Conditions that would like to attach is that for the school insure that
residents of the community actually have a greater access to the facility, that
would help alleviate the traffic, and the congestion that people talked about.
This is great project and support Comm. Theoharis. Made a motion.
 

  


Commissioner Antenore
: Questioned re: If the additional conditions were
drafted into the motion? Thought this process they went thru by sending it back
for further discussion, didn't really work as well as he hoped. There was too
much between both sides, a tremendous of just simply a generation of paper
supporting or opposing the project without really making a good use of the time
for trying to solve problems. Despite, that, think a progress was made. If
there a reason, why this conditions had not been added in the motion.
 

  


Commissioner Joe
: Requested if a fence could be put, so Sr. Citizens
could have some yard space.

developers (Mills) they pull back the bldg., the most minimum amount from the
rear property line on each of the bldgs., so they full no coverage on the
garage level and they up one floor and they pull back about 10 ft. Asked, How
many units get the only light from the rear and what is the about separation
between bldg.,? Why this Commission do not deal with this. How many substandard
housing units are going to be there?

Block 3777, Lots 38 and 41, on Brannan and Freelon Streets between Fourth and
Fifth Streets in a Service/Light Industrial (SLI) Zoning District. To consider
an
 appeal of the Preliminary Negative Declaration on the proposed project.

The site currently contains a two-story office building and a one-story to
two-story building occupied by a warehouse, offices, and retail outlet for an
import company; and a shed. The proposed project encompasses merging the two
lots; subdividing the resulting lot into three lots; demolishing the existing
buildings, and constructing three four-story, 55-foot tall live/work buildings,
each containing 36 live/work units in three levels with mezzanines totaling
about 34,000 square feet and 36 parking spaces in a ground floor parking
garage, for a total of 108 live/work units totaling about 102,000 square feet
and 108 parking spaces. Garage access and egress for each building would be on
Brannan Street.

Ms. Tillman, 
lived across the street from project for 30 yrs.,
objected to number of issues on of them is the scope of the project is far
greater than anything in the area and the plan submitted to Planning are in
excess of the acceptable planning code limited of 55 ft., there are almost 65 ft.




Sue Hestor, 
in my comments I really focus on cumulative
development issues and the Dept., came back with graphics that has little of
that, the size of the project is huge, this is the largest simple live/work
project to come before the Commission.
 


Tony Dominiski, 
property owner since 1976, referred to pg., 11 on the
Neg. Dec., there are couple thing that are contradictory. 
 


Ray Curr, 
had an office on Freelon since 1985; traffic impact is
very significant to the intersection 5th/Brannan). Developers want to build a
huge building that has not accommodation for setbacks. Robert Scott, would
really like to see that this bldg., could be scale down. 
 


Steve Vettel
, representing Project Sponsor, made some responses to
the issues that were raised at the hearing. There was an intensive study re:
cumulative development issue as part of the Neg. Dec., and was also included in
the doc., and that this project contribution to cumulative impact was no considerable,
it was no even detectable. Document is adequate, present the project fairly,
the staff analysis in response to the appeal is thoroughly.

Commissioner Antenore
: In the analysis is stated that this site is located
within in Industrial Protection Buffer Zone. What is the meaning of Buffer
Zone. 
 


Gerald G. Green - Director of Planning,
 created a Buffer within the Industrial Protection
Zone, in those instances they were either, joining residential properties or
residential zones. Going thru the analysis, the guidelines required as to
include the additional preference statements which you include in your
decision. 
 


Commissioner Antenore,
 if this was not a pipeline project, what review we
would have over this project? if came in after 4/27, and we are not reviewing,
what would be the nature of our review?
 


Gerald Green - Director of Planning,
 in the Industrial Protection Zone Buffer, a
conditional use authorization would be required. The preference would be toward
using the current guidelines, which really are leaning more toward protecting
PDR. But this a pipeline project we included the original guidelines which were
this project was designed for.

live/work are currently no permitted. 
 


Elaine Bernstein Tillman, 
in the last page of the project report, said Freelon
St., has withdrawn their appealed, which is completly false, Additionally, the
height limit was falsely thru the Planning Department, submitted to you for
approval as 55 ft., when the limit is really 50 ft., then you give an extra 5
ft., to live/work unit.
 

  


Sue Hestor,
 this bldg., is more 50,000 sq.,ft., of commerical
space. This Commission had been very delinquent in applying following the law.
Commerical bldgs., over 50,000 sq.,ft., has to comply with the City first
source hiring program, which is no in the Planning Code, it is in the Administrative
Code. You are required to condition this prog., on certain jobs and employment
outreach conditions which is not mentioned in the file. This Commission is out
compliance witht the law, is you do not condition this proj., on compliance
w/first source hiring ruled of the City both construction and permanent jobs.

would accommodate 150 units not the 500 units that Ms. Hestor mentioned.If
elevator is put in the bldg., would change the ramifications of the project.

the whole purpose of this D.R., was there no zoning
conditions concerning this type of establishment in S.F. Agreed w/staff re:
conditions of approval- Hours of operation. Parking issues, many people that came
to an establishment like this one, has handicap license plate.
 


Wayne Justiman, 
Director and co-founder of the S.F., Patience Resource
Ctr. - Project Sponsor. Gave an overview of the project and also answers some
of the concerns from members of the Planning Commission. 
 


Terence Halinan, 
re: minimum restrictions on this operation, as a has
been point out for a number of years. He worked really closed with the staff of
this project. There are very little complaints. Would suggest that this is a
pretty empty strike, there are no problems, there cooperative. To put
restrictions on them on his opinion is to start off in the wrong foot, he is
trying to get all this operation to cooperate to go thru the proper procedures
and if they are restricted with whatever they are trying to do, so I will
suggest that we worked with them as least restricted as possible. If hour are
going to be put on them, they should be hours that are reasonable with other
business in that neighborhood. We should see for remedy that would be in
anybody interest.
 


Rod Roach,
 do not grant D.R. for this project, this is based
upon a concern the D.R., requestor, had concerning: noise, traffic, loitering.




Mandy Webster,
 Medical patient, volunteer at S.F. Patient Res. Ctr.,
change of hours would impact the Ctr., severely. All patients have different
appointments, some time even into late in the evening.

Staff Comments:
 


Commissioner Antenore: 
No testimony that justified any restrictions that we
would not place on any operation in this particular location, based on the
history up to now. They shouldn't have any restrictions in terms of hours
operation, in re: to other business operation in the area by requirement. Voted
against motion.
 


Gerald Green, Director of Planning, 
pointed out that there are other business in the area
that are open after the hours that are suggested here. The dept., responded to
concerns, fears. Not calling a Pharmacy, but in all fairness recognize, there
is a legislation that had been adopted that allowed pharmacies to remain open
24 hrs., primarily because of the need, no suggesting that they be allowed to
be open even until midnight. Also responding to a comment that was made re:
limiting hours re: restaurant operations; the theory that we are limiting the
hours of operation to the general public, when a restaurant closes for business
there still a lot work that has to be done and our interpretation has allowed
that work to go on after the hrs., operation, we are really concerned about the
service that is provided in hrs., to the general public. The Commission has an
option, he suggested that in the past they had taken some cases, had attached a
condition that no have any hrs., or you would any hrs. , but you would have a
test to be run. It might be possible if you add a condition that would allow
for this to be conducted for a period of time, and there is any complaints, you
can bring it back here. Recommend attach the condition of approval, focusing in
the hrs., of operation.
 


Commissioner Mills, 
Take D.R. Approved the project with the conditions as
created by staff.
 


Commissioner Richardson,
 We should focus in the security issue. We shouldn't
impose any restrictions. Have them come back within a year. Do not take a
D.R.

 Appeal of Preliminary Negative Declaration for 
    a mixed use project with approximately 14,000 gross square feet of retail/commercial 
    space and 128 residential units with a revised total of 126 parking spaces 
    accessed from Page Street in an 80-foot high new building at 55 Page and through 
    reuse of the facade of the existing building at 49 Page Street. 




SPEAKER(S):
(-) David Snyder, Exec. Director, San Francisco Bicycle 
    Coalition 
-- traffic gross is estimated to be at .5% compounded annually 
    and that is 6.5% in 13 years. Pointed out the traffic on Valencia, Dolores, 
    Guerrero, South Van Ness and Mission showed an increase in just 1 year of 
    1.1% and that is over a time period that there weren’t any traffic changes 
    as a result of the Central Freeway. The traffic pattern in the area, was practically 
    stable during the time period. This data is reliable. Traffic on Market Street, 
    showed similar increases. Over 13 yrs., the difference between a 1.1% and 
    a .5% is a difference between 6.5% and 15%.





    (-) John Suisky 
-- would like the developer to reduce the number of parking 
    spaces. Encouraged the department to re assess requirements in areas like 
    this.
