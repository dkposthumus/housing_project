,-
 Appeal of
Preliminary Negative Declaration.
 The project site occupies the northern
half of a blockbordered by Fourteenth Street to the north, Mission Street to
the east, FifteenthStreet to the south, and Julian Street to the west. The
proposed projectinvolves the rehabilitation of the existing four-level (plus
basement) StateArmory building and conversion of the use from vacant to a
telecommunicationsfacility. The project would provide approximately 240,000 gsf
of space devoted to telecommunication tenants (including co-location companies,
web hosting companies, and/or telecommunication switching firms) and parking.
The proposedproject includes 32 off-street (self-park) parking spaces and a
loading areathat could accommodate at least two trucks. The site is within a
C-M (HeavyCommercial) District and the 50-X and 65-B Height and Bulk Districts
andis within the Mission District neighborhood. The building is listed in
Appendix A of Article 10 of the Planning Code as City Landmark #108 and is
listedon the 
National Register of Historic Places
. A variance would
berequired to provide fewer than the Planning Code-required amount of
parkingspaces. 


Preliminary
Recommendation: Uphold Preliminary Negative Declaration


(Continued
from Regular Meeting of October 26, 2000)


 


SPEAKER(S):



(-) Luis Granados - Mission Economic Development Association


-
The intent of the CEQA process is to find out the negative impacts of a
particular project. By looking at those impacts the project may be improved.


-
Previously, there was a negative declaration that was issued. It was appealed
and then there was a new project. There was no real analysis of what other
alternatives were less negative.


-
The baseline for determining the impacts of the project wasn ?t done correctly.


-
The project is located in the Mission District -- a residential neighborhood
that has gone through a lot of land use changes over the last 9 years.


-
The study states that there is no potential impacts on land use. That ?s not
true since there are significant impacts from this project. The project
maximizes the potential negative impacts because of the 90,000 gallons of
hazardous waste that would be located in this facility.


(-) Sue Hestor


-
She would like to speak about the 96,000 gallons of diesel fuel which will be
brought into this project.


-
This project is located across the street from apartment complexes.


-
1875 Mission Street was an apparel factory yet it is being converted to
dot.coms.


-
Sliding over the issues of growth-inducing impacts is ludicrous.


(-) Heather Rogers


-
She is a member of MAC and a member of Redstone Tenants Association


-
She supports the appeal. 


(-) Eric Quesada - MAC


-
MAC, Poder and other organizations are feeling the effects of the so-called
developments in the Mission.


(+) Andrew Junius - Law Office of Reuben and Alter - Representing
Icon Capitals


- He clarified some aspects of CEQA - CEQA asks
to look for substantialevidence that a project will cause a significant impact
on the environment.


-
The appeal talks about a lot of things but not about significant impacts on the
environment.


-
The appellant spoke about growth-inducing impacts. This facility/project is for
equipment only and not for people. There will only be about 150people employed
here. This project will not cause other businesses to comeinto the area since
the equipment can be accessed from any where in the world.


(+) Roberto Estrada


-
He has lived in the area for many years. Although he is affiliated with many
organizations in the Mission, he comes to speak as a concerned individual.


-
This area is very dilapidated, full of crime, and is an area that needs a
dramatic change.


-
We have to look at this project in a different point of view. This site has
been vacant for over 25 years. It ?s time that changes be done to develop this
project and clean up the neighborhood.


(+) Richard Reutlinger - Victorian Alliance


-
The Alliance wrote a letter a few weeks ago. He read the letter regarding the
environmental effects of this project.


(+) John Barbey - Liberty Hill Neighborhood Association


-
Not everyone in the neighborhood is in agreement with members of MAC.


-
Everyone in the Mission District is aware that this project has been idle for
too many years.


-
This use will be a good one for the armory building.


(+) Carlyle A. Johnston - Alfred Williams Consulting


-
Submitted letters in support of the project and did not have any comments.


(+) Mauricio Aviles - Arriba Juntos


-
The government of this City has left the Mission District alone for 25years.


-
The new industries that are coming in will develop the area one way oranother.


-
The residents of the Mission will benefit in many ways.


-
This project will develop jobs.


(+) Winchell F. Hayward - California Heritage Council


-
He would like the Commission to uphold the negative declaration. The armory
building should be maintained.


-
He has lived in the city for over 40 years and doesn ?t remember that the
armory has been used for anything.


-
He would like to leave the marble base boards in the interior hallwaysof the
building. 


(+) Larry Burnett


-
Has lived in the Mission for about 20 years.


-
He read a letter from the Inner Mission Neighborhood Group in support of the
project.


(+) Peter McDevit


- He lives in northwest Bernal Heights. He is
not part of any organization but supports the project.


(+) Joe Porcoro - Northwest Bernal Alliance


-
His organization supports this project.


-
He believes that this building is a ?white elephant. ?


-
He works for the telephone company and was able to take a tour of the interior
of the building.


-
Property owners cannot raise the rents since the area is under rent control.


(+) Jeffrey Livovits


-
He would like to know how the appellants feels about the ARCO gasolinestation
across the street since they are concerned about the fuel on site.


-
Federal regulations have to deal with fuel containers when it comes todiesel
generators. Many buildings throughout the city have them.


-
It?s about time that the building is paid attention to.

Appeal of Preliminary Negative Declaration.
 The proposed project is the
demolition of a furniture showroom and warehouse and construction of 30
live/work units, 30 off-street ground floor parking spaces, and approximately
4,680 square feet of retail space within a new three-story (including two
mezzanine levels) structure. The new building would be approximately 50'in
height and would have vehicular access from Harrison Street. The mainpedestrian
entrance would be located on 10th Street, with a secondary entranceon Harrison
Street. The site is within the Planning Commission?s adopted Industrial
Protection Zone (IPZ) Buffer, where conditional use authorization is required
for new live/work or housing development and for industrialbuilding demolition.
The project site is located within the SLR (Service/Light
Industrial/Residential) zoning district and within the 50-X Height and
Bulkdistrict. 
              








Recommendation: Uphold Preliminary Negative Declaration
             

.


 


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Sue Hestor


-
It?s unfortunate that staff continues to gloss over the loss of industrial
businesses in an area that is an IPZ.


-
The commission adopted controls about 15 years ago.


-
There is a list of displacements that she submitted to the Commissioners.


-
There is no environmental analysis and no environmental thinking, yet this is
an environmental issue.


(+) Kevin Huye - Reuben and Alter representing Fred Wilman,
Project Sponsor


-
Fred Wilman has operated a furniture store for about 20 years now. Mr. Wilman
would like to retire and redevelop the site. He is counting on this
redevelopment project to finance his retirement.


-
There is no substantial evidence of significant affects on the environment in
the report.


-
The appellant is concerned mostly about larger policy related issues and CEQA
is not concerned about policy related issues.


(-) Speaker did not state name


- Each project which involves developments of
loft housing is not working for the city. People are suffering because there
aren ?t enough affordable housing development.

-
The project sponsor looked at various sites for the purpose of his project.


-
The building currently standing doesn ?t even have heat. It ?s just like a
warehouse so the building will be demolished.


-
The proposed project is desirable and compatible with the other uses and
buildings in the area.


(+) Toby Levy - Project Architect


-
In this project, they have actually added signage bands.

The spaces in these buildings would really be identified as live and work.

This project complies with the interim controls, it voluntarily includes
affordable housing.


-
This developer has played by the rules.


-
He recommends that the Commission approve this project.


(-) Sue Hestor


-
Once uses are changed, they are permanently changed.


-
These uses have all been changed.


-
Affordable housing is required in various lots.


-
There is nothing for families.


(-) John Elberling


-
There is a key question: ?why does the Commission continue to fail to apply it
?s policy of affordable housing? ?


-
This question can be answered today, by rejecting this project.


-
The Commission needs to come to the South of Market area and face the
neighbors.


(-) Anastasia Yovanopolous


-
She is a tenant.


-
The BOS did approve an ordinance to preserve single-occupancy housing.


(-) Joan Holding - Commission for Arts, Jobs and Housing


-
She is not surprised to hear developers make any argument. Yet she isstill
amazed to hear staff use the existence of live/works units in an industrial
neighborhood as an argument as to why it ?s ok to approve more. She would
expect just the opposite.

creating and preserving storage space for non-profit organizations.


-
The project which was started in 1981 has been a very successful project.

Together the agency, private development community, and non-profits have built
over 2,000 housing units approximately 1/3 affordable units, commercial
development, and a wonderful waterfront.

INTERIM ZONING CONTROLS - INDUSTRIAL PROTECTION
ZONES AND MIXED USE HOUSING ZONES
 - Consideration of extension for nine (9)
months of Interim Zoning Controls which establish Industrial Protection Zones
and Mixed Use Housing Zones Within Industrially Zoned Land. The interim zoning
controls establish an industrial protection zone where new residential and
live/work uses are not permitted and demolition of industrial buildings
requires a conditional use authorization; a mixed use housing zone where
residential and live/work uses are encouraged; and buffer zones where
residential and live/work uses require conditional use authorization. The
interim zoning controls apply to all lots zoned M-1, M-2, C-M, RSD, SLR, SLI,
SPD, SSO in the area generally bounded by Market Street from The Embarcadero to
Valencia Street, South to Twenty-Fourth Street, East to Highway 101, South to
Highway 280 and South along Mission Street to Geneva Avenue, and then East to

jurisdiction of the San Francisco Port, and lots in the Mission Bay North and
Mission Bay South Redevelopment Project Areas, the Hunters Point Shipyard
Redevelopment Project Area, the Rincon Point/South Beach Redevelopment Project
Area and the Transbay Survey Area. The interim zoning controls would be

Francisco


-
A recent economic impact study done by the port of San Francisco showed that
for the fiscal year ending 1999, the ship repair and other industries alone
contributed 1,438 direct jobs as well as 1,600 indirect jobs.


-
The maritime industries and cargo industries are growing. Although a lot of
business was lost to the Port of Oakland, the Port of San Francisco refocused
their marketing efforts to attract the smaller and mid-sized shipping
businesses. The port has been very successful in attracting these businesses to
thePort.


(+) Jim Wilshire


-
He is co-chairman of the Maritime/Commerce Committee just formed by the Port of
San Francisco.


-
Most of the members are involved in industries that require access to their
facilities by water.


-
The Committee understands the needs of accommodating the various people and the
housing needs of the area, they also understand the need for thedot.coms.


-
He would appreciate from the Commission consideration to extend the 9-month
extension on the IPZ.


(+) Mark Francis - NBC Transportation


-
NBC Transportation is a support group to the steamship lines calling on the
Port of San Francisco.


-
He urges the Commission to support the extension of the IPZ for the benefit of
future commerce in San Francisco.


(+) Roger Peters - San Francisco resident


-
He has worked with the Port of San Francisco for 15 years. Now he is an
independent consultant specializing in industrial waterfront development.


-
The current industrial zone preservation legislation provides protection for
this essential industry and others. The current set of IPZs shouldbe extended.

Potrero Hill or the Mission District.


-
IPZ has not prevented the displacement of neighborhood distribution and retail

Why is the Commission not taking care of the people who need 2 and 3 bedroom
units.


(+) Brad Paul - Coalition for Jobs, Arts and Housing


-
Zoning Options for Industrial Land is a report produced by the Planning
Department and it ?s one of the best reports the department has done in the
last 5 years.


-
This report started out trying to protect about 750 to 1,000 acres of
industrial land left in the City out of 15,000 acres.


-
Why would you try to protect industrial from housing?


-
In good financial times if you allow office, residential and industrial, what
you get is lots of office, maybe a little residential in the form of live/work
that ?s actually used as residential and no industrial. IF you just ban office,
what you get is lots of high-end residential and no industrial.


-
Therefore, you have to ban office and residential if you want to project industrial.
This was true then and is true now. 


(Neutral) Dick Millet - Potrero Boosters Neighborhood Association


-
He doesn ?t know whether to support the extention of the IPZ, maybe it would be
better to go back just to the straight industrial.


-
There is a resolution from the department that states ?discourage, discourage,
discourage in the IPZ ?.


(+) Joe Cassidy - Residential Builders

He has heard a lot of talk about office space and where it is being built in

He is in favor of IPZ and they will work with the department to preserve these
industrial protection zones especially along the Port and along Army Street.


(+) Alice Barkley


-
About 2 weeks ago she came to the Commission and she urged the department to
make sure that there are true industrial zones in this City.

This item is extention of industrial protection zones. All the previous speakers
talk about the next item.


-
There is no new application for live/work in IPZs. They have only come before
the Commission in mixed use housing districts.


(+) Joe O ?Donahue - Residential Builders


-
It was interesting to hear the ILWU and the Port workers to speak about this
item.


-
His organization has joined with the ILWU in asking for an extension of the
industrial use.


-
There are people in the City which the Commission will never please.


-
Of the 3,000 live/work loft buildings which his members built, there were no
evictions.


(+) Sue Hestor


-
Interim controls are supposed to be followed by permanent controls. 


-

LIVE-WORK TO LOFT HOUSING AMENDMENT
 - Consideration of
amendments toPart II, Chapter II, of the San Francisco Municipal Code (Planning
Code)by amending Sections 102.7 and 102.13 to redefining ?live/work?units as
?loft housing? and classifying them as residential uses;repealing Section 233
regarding live/work; adding Section 232 to establishrequirements for loft
housing that would subject it to existing live/workcontrols except that there
would be no restriction on the nature of workwhich could be preformed in the
unit so long as the use is permitted in theSSO (Service/Secondary Office)
Zoning District and no requirement that theoccupant(s) work in the unit, would
require loft housing to comply with inclusionary housing policies, would
establish and in-lieu payment for affordable housingrequirements in the 40/85
foot height district contained wholly within thesouth of market Residential
Service District (RSD), would require loft housingin residential areas to
comply with all requirements for residential usesincluding the residential

height, front setback and open space requirements, wouldprohibit existing
live/work units from being used or converted to officespace, and establishes
minimum dwelling unit air and light exposure standard;states that this

Preliminary Recommendation: Adopt the draft
Ordinance recommending approval to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.


 


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Mr. Schumacker


- When the Katz legislation was drafted it did
not allow an opportunityfor conditional use authorization that would allow a
conversion from live/work to office.


-
Somehow in the version of the legislation that appears before the Commission
that conditional use authorization is now available. There is no circumstance
under which live/work should be allowed to convert to office. It ?s against the
whole point of the entire live/work concept.


(-) Jeffrey Leivobitz


- The live/work lofts are being converted into
office as well. The Commission needs to put caps on the size of these
developments.


-
Sometimes it ?s better to let the market place dictate the uses.


-
Maybe it ?s better to allow the developer or the owner to have the choice if
the market place demands office, under the caps; if it demands residential then
build residential under these caps.


(-) Alice Barkley


-
She supports staff recommendation to continue this item.


-
This Commission should not adopt a piece of legislation with policy init that

other. ?


-
The issue of live/work abiding residential sites which has been a hugeproblem
with the people in Potrero Hill and the Mission.

There is no substance in the Katz Legislation.

standard from the City Attorney.


(-) Joe O?Donahue

-
Affordable housing at a penthouse on Russian Hill will change the effects and
nature of the area.

SPEAKER(S):


(+) Warner Schmalls - Project Architect


-
This is a unique project since it ?s a historic building.


-
This is a 114 year old building. It was originally the California Electric
Light Company built in 1886.


-
The building will be rebuilt to emulate its 1906 appearance. The building is
just a shell, there is no structural integrity to the building.


- Because of its historic quality and the need
in the zoning code to preserve this building, giving office use as an incentive
is the reason that a developer/owner can afford to seismically upgrade this
building and bring it up to code and spend the resources that is required to
preserve this building.


-
From the outside the building will resemble it ?s 1906 appearance.


-
There were some issues to face with the neighbors but these issues have been
dealt with.


-
They have worked really hard with the neighbors to make sure that everything is
in order.


(+) Mark Mathis - Project Sponsor


-
His father and partner bought the building in 1968.


-
This building started life in 1888. After being damaged in the 1906 earthquake
it was mostly used as a warehouse.


-
Some structural work was done to the building already.


(+) Mike O?Neal - Legacy Partnersformer Lincoln Property

working with the Heritage Foundation to try to save the building.


-It
was unfortunate that the smoke stack was removed.


-
This project will create a deficit parking. This area needs to createmore
parking garages and here there will be a reduction of parking. He wouldlike to
go forward on the 90 parking spaces which is a minimum for this use.


-
This is a historic resource.


-
He would like a conditional use to be granted and be attached.


(+) Sue Hestor


- She was ready to file a DR when the developer
was going to call themselves a 24,999 square foot office building and 25,001

128 KING STREET
 , south side of King
Street between Second and ThirdStreets, Lot 23 in Assessor's Block 3794 --
Staff Initiated DiscretionaryReview of Building Permit Application Nos.
9725403, 9725404, 9801069, and9801070, proposing to rehabilitate, seismically
upgrade and re-use the existingvacant unreinforced masonry warehouse building
into art, restaurant and multimediaspace. The proposed project also includes
the addition of a partial mezzaninelevel within the building and a penthouse
addition on the fourth floor.The project site is within the M-2 (Heavy
Industrial) District, a 105-X Heightand Bulk District, within the proposed
Ballpark Vicinity Special Use District'sSouth End Office District, and is a
Contributory Building to the South EndHistoric District. By Resolution 14844,
the Planning Commission adopteda policy of Automatic Discretionary Review for
project or permit applicationsthat do not meet the more restrictive provisions
of the proposed South Endpermanent controls. Under these controls the proposed
project would be requiredto receive Conditional Use Authorization for the bar
and restaurant use,and is therefore currently subject to the Discretionary
Review process.


Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary
Review, applicant should reduce square footage of the restaurant/bar.


 


SPEAKER(S):


(+)Dan Sullivan - Representing Project Sponsor - Van Properties


-
This project is to rehabilitate a UMB into restaurant and multimedia use. 


-
The proposed restaurant meets all the criteria set forth in section 303 and the
Special Use District.


-
The proposal is for a restaurant not a sports bar.


-
The building has passed through the landmarks process. The building has had no
parking access.


-
This site is very well served by public transit.


-
Regarding traffic issues like off street loading and people who would be coming
into the restaurant --there is a loading zone which is very restrictive.
Passenger who need to debark at the restaurant, there is a passenger zone in
front of MOMO restaurant which can be extended.


(+) Alan Byer - Project Sponsor


- He has been in the garment business for 36
years.


-
San Francisco has been really good to him. It has afforded him the luxury to be
involved with the group that purchased the Giants in 1992 when they were ready
to leave town.


-
He as been involved in developing the area around the ballpark. 


-
This project is a long-time family investment.


-
He has gone through all the heritage and landmark obligations and bothare
supporting this project.


(+) Joe O?Donahue - 


-
This is a contributory building. 


-
He supports this project entirely.


(-) Jeffrey Leibovitz


-
Valet Parking should be applied. MOMO does it and this project shouldrequire it
as well.


(-) Sue Hestor


- She has been tracking this project for a long
time. She requested that staff communicate to her about changes through this
project but nothing was ever communicated to her. She has had no response to
her letters.


-
How do you appeal a project you don ?t even know about?


-
The developer will find out that it ?s not smart to attach a tenancy to a
determination.


(-) Michael Burke - Represents SOMA Partners LLP


-
His clients want to support this project but they feel compelled to oppose it
as proposed because of two reasons: There are no provisions for off-street
parking. The Neg Dec states a requirement for off-street parking. There is no
provision for off-street loading. These deficits will create negative impacts
on this block.


(-) Douglas Rosenberg - Developer/Partner of 139 Townsend and 160
King LLC 


-
He has never opposed a project.


-
He has tried to be reasonable with the project sponsor. This is not apersonal
vendetta.


-
There should be a consistent application of the Planning Code.


-
If there is a change in the policy, then things need to be reconsidered.


-
The loading issue can be solved and he can sit with the project sponsor to work
something out.


-
Regarding the parking, he is looking for some sort of consistency withsimilar
situations on previous projects.


(-) Paul Stein - SKS Investments


-
He is not involved with 160 King Street.


- He was invited by the project sponsor to discuss
off-street loading and after that meeting the sponsor never called him again.


ACTION: 
Take DR with the following
requirements: Reduce square footage, require valet parking; establish offpeak
loading hours


AYES:

1998.885V (GORDON: 558-6309)


128 KING STREET
, south side of King
Street between Second and Third Streets, Lot 23 in Assessor's Block 3794.
Request for an off-street parking variance from the Planning Code required 54
off-street parking spaces. Section 151 of the Planning Code requires in total
112 off-street parking spaces forthe proposed mixed uses at the site. However,
the existing warehouse building was constructed in 1913 without providing any
on-site parking spaces. Therefore there is a current parking deficiency of 58
off-street parking spaces for the previous warehouse use on the site, thereby
reducing the amount of the Planning Code required off-street parking for the
new proposed uses to 54 spaces. No off-street parking spaces are proposed
. 
The
project site is within the M-2 (Heavy Industrial) District, a 105-X Height and
Bulk District, within the proposed Ballpark Vicinity Special Use District's
South End Office District, and is a Contributory Building to the South End
Historic District. 


Preliminary
Recommendation: Approval with conditions.

None

75 ZIRCON PLACE
, east side of Zircon Place between 29th and Day
Streets, Lot 068 in Assessor's Block 7537 -- Request for Discretionary Review
ofBuilding Permit Application No. 2000/02/03/1013 proposing the constructionof
a new four-story, single-family dwelling in an RH-1 (Residential,
House,One-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District. Preliminary
Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the building
permit application as submitted.


Preliminary
Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approvebuilding permit.


 


SPEAKER(S):

    
(-) Did not state name - Project Sponsor


-
The main questions are: 1) Is this project too big for the neighborhood. Have
all the parties really exhausted negotiating to find an agreeablesolution? He
believes that neither of these are true.


-
The volume and mass of the proposed structure is too large. It will be the
biggest structure on this street.


-
He is not opposed to the needs of the family of this project but they should
have purchased a larger lot. 


(-) Buck Trigers- Co-Trustee of 95 Zircon Place


- The structure is quite monolithic as proposed.


(-) Randy Vistine


-
He met Shamus McGee, his daughter, Janet, and the architect Steven Antinaris.
Mr. McGee ?s manner was quite bullish and intimidating. Mr. McGee stated that
he had been building houses for 35 years and never had problems like this. But
that ?s not true because Mr. Vistine ?s father was a contractor and always had
problems like this.


-
When Mr. Passmore subdivided the lot in 1997, his statement was that the house
that was to be built on this lot could be no more than 900 square feet. Mr.
Antenaris plans call for a footprint of about 1,060 square feet.


(-) Steve Matune


- This house was proposed 15 years ago but it
wasn ?t able to be built because the street was located in the Diamond Heights
Redevelopment Area. The zoning for most of Diamond Heights fell under that, the
houses on either side were constructed under the Redevelopment rules.


-
This house is just too large for the neighborhood. The houses on either side
are a lot smaller.


(-) Leticio Mariano


-
He lives in the neighborhood.


-
The proposed structure will tower over his house. He has some concerns and
would like to propose a reasonable dialog with the developer. Other concerns
involve the steepness of the slope where the proposed structurewill be located.


(-) Mark Rupper


- 
Has lived on Zircon Street for more than 20 years and would like
to retain the pleasant atmosphere which now exists there.


-
All structures should be of the same silhouette and size. The proposed
structure does not meet these conditions.


-
He is also disturbed by the constant shifting of figures and dates of
completion. He believes a reasonable compromise can be achieved but the final
details of the project should be settled by the neighbors. To date, no one has
contacted him.


(-) Bill Kurtis


-
He is going to be right next to the proposed structure.


-
A few months ago, he signed something but didn ?t really read what he signed.
He is sorry that he signed the document.


-
He has lived in this area for many years. He has seen Diamond Heightsbeing
developed.


-
The new structure will be totally out of scale with this neighborhood.


(-) Linette Crain


- She loves her neighborhood and is very proud
of it. When she saw thedesign of the structure she was appalled and would like
to have the Commissiontake DR on this project.


(-) Sherie Brocker


-
She supports taking DR and agrees with all the neighbors who have spoken
previously.


(+) Brett Gladstone


- There were 3 meetings with Mr. Goodman. Mr.
Gladstone understood that Mr. Goodman was speaking for the rest of the
neighbors. He is sorry if he misunderstood and didn ?t go to the neighbors
directly.


-
The report produced by Mr. Passmore didn ?t state that there were conditions
limiting the size of the future lot. Because of the strange lot configuration
and the small size, to develop a decent-sized home would require some kind of a
variance for a front yard deck which is what is before the Commission.


-
The issues have always been regarding views.


-
The project was originally 10 feet higher. It was brought down by request of
staff. Mr. Goodman requested story poles, then there was a further reduction.


-
Mr. Goodman has requested to keep a view of St. Paul ?s Church. This would
require the removal of the entire peaked roof of this project which would
severely impact the livability and the sizeof the project. If the peak roof was
eliminated and instead put a flat room it would be totally different from the
other houses.


(+) Joe O?Donahue - Residential Builders


-
This is a sloping lot.


-
This building is a modest building. It is two stories above street level. 


-
The issues about the Redevelopment Agency would have been imposed whenthey took
jurisdiction of the area.


(+) Patricia Voughey


-
She has worked with Mr. McGee and she knows that he is a very, very good
builder.

Do not take DR and Approve Building Permit

, east side of Zircon Place between 29th and Day
Streets; Lot 068 in Assessor's Block 7537 in an RH-1 (Residential, House,
One-Family) District AND 40-X Height and Bulk District. FRONT YARD VARIANCES
SOUGHT
 :
 The proposal is to construct a new deck in the required front
setback. The deck will allow for entry access to a new 4-story, single family
dwelling. Section 132(d)(2) of the Planning Code requires a maximum 15-foot
frontsetback, measured from the front property line for the subject property.
The proposed deck would encroach entirely into the required front setback.

2844 GREENWICH STREET
 - between Baker and Lyon Streets, Lot 033 in
Assessor?s Block 0940, proposing to raise the split level roof in the rear to
matchthe existing roof level in the front in an RH-2 (Residential, House,
Two-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take
discretionary review and approve the building permit as submitted


 


SPEAKER(S):



(-) Patricia Vaughey


-
For the sake of Commissioner Fay, Baltimore and Salinas, she showed a picture
of the penthouse.


-
On May 13, the Commission asked the property owner to take down the penthouse
and canceled the project.


-
At the April 13, 2000 meeting, Mr. Somaya was informed by the Commissioners of
the gravity of what he had done.


-
On May 4, 2000, Mr. Somaya said that he would bring the penthouse downif he
could keep his permit. At the time he made his speech he had alreadymade a
?peace meal? permit on May 3, 2000 for the windows of that permit and then
hesubsequently applied for the raising of the roof and the sidewall for
thepatio on the front.


-
As of yesterday, Bureau of Building Inspection does not report any final
inspections for the roof.


-
Neighbors have seen the walls come down but the wood has remained there. The
neighbors are concerned that the penthouse is still going to go up.


(-) Jennifer Crandal
l


- She lives west of the proposed building. She
is upset by the unethical way that this is being built.


(-) Bob Greeley


-
He is a neighbor. About a month ago he received a notice that there would be
some construction done to raise the split level roof. He called various places
and finally ended up at the Planning Department. He requested a blueprint to
try to understand what splitting a level roof was.


-
About a week ago he received a notice to come over to the proposed project
site. He won ?t over and started talking with the project sponsor. He requested
to see pictures of the project and he only received a small piece of paper.


(-) Dr. Gene McCoy


- The building has been finished and there is no
intention to rebuild this. The building is horrendous and the owner has done a
good job to alienate the neighbors.


-
Would like the Commission to deny this project.


(-) Greg Hanson- Cow Hollow Neighborhood in Action


- He has been asked to speak on behalf of the
owner and the residents of the building which he lives in. The issues are
regarding air and light.


(-)Tim Lucier


- He lives across the back yard from the
proposed building. His light will be reduced because of this building. There
has been construction at 5:00 a.m. and even during Christmas Eve.


-
He doesn ?t trust the owner of the proposed building.


(-) Mary Boardman


-
On the April 13, 2000 hearing, the Cow Hollow Association urged the Commission
to maintain the roof at the existing level. It was not just about the
penthouse. There have been requests and petitions for a sun study.


-
This is a case of a family wanting more light in their living room. This is at
the expense of reduction of light and air to all the neighbors.


(-) Richard Olsen


-
He lives in the neighborhood. There were 27 people that requested a sun study.
The owner of the proposed structure did a so-called sun study.


-
Everyone on the block is very concerned about this project.


(-) Chris Vankovitch


-
He is speaking on behalf of himself and his grandparents. His bedroomwindow
faces north and a small number of feet from the structure. It willhave an
adverse affect on the light coming into his bedroom.


-
The structure is completely out of taste to the neighborhood.


(-) Stuart Fung


-
His family lives in a building adjacent to the proposed structure.


-
He has directly seen the impact of the illegal construction of the penthouse.
If the roof is raised it will affect the light coming into his home.


(+) Christopher Moscone - Representing project sponsor


- He represents Jitu Somaya. The last two
speakers are related to the last DR requestor who withdrew the DR.


-
Since the Commission requested the removal of the penthouse, he has done just
as the Commission requested.


-
Mr. Somaya and his wife has paid the price for the mistake they made regarding
the penthouse.


-
The penthouse is not an issue anymore. This proposal is not about thepenthouse
but about raising the roof to the size of what is already in thefront of the
building.


-
The wood which is still on the roof, is wood which will be reused for raising
the roof.


-
The DR were filed by two people: Mr. Fung and Ms. Voughey. Among other things
Mr. Somaya agreed to an additional 9 1/2 foot setback. He also agreed to paint
the vertical wall facing the Somaya ?s property a white or off-white color
which was Mr. Fung ?s choice. Mr. Fung withdrew his DR. The remaining DR is of
Mrs.Voughey.


-
He would like the Commission to decide this matter on the merits. Mr.Somaya
made a mistake and he is paying for it. There are neighbors thatMs. Voughey
brought who oppose the project yet there are neighbors here whodo support the
project.


(+) Robert Marciel - Independent Consultant


-
He works for the Pacific Energy Center. They provide a service regarding light.


- He went to the Residential Design Guidelines
and there is a question of a pattern of rear yard depth creating a common open
space. In this casethere isn?t.


(+) Vishal Thacker


-
He, along with Robert Marciel, worked on the shadow analysis. This study has
been done on a very professional basis. The building model from thearchitect is
up to scale.


(+) Susan Somaya


- She is here to ask the support of the
Commission and ask for their approval.


-
When she found out that there was a DR filer, she was shocked because she and
her husband had spoken to all the neighbors.


-
She took pictures of the homes, every hour on the hour from her cameraand
showed them to her neighbors.


(+) Steve Rehmus


-
He has lived in Cow Hollow for 3 years. He supports the project completely.


-
He showed some diagrams comparing the homes in the neighborhood regarding
height.


(+) Amy Nicolas


-
She has lived in Cow Hollow for many years. She supports the project. The
concern of the penthouse not being removed is not correct. Mr. Somaya invited
the planner for a site visit. She read a letter from the Planner to Mr. Somaya
regarding the site visit.


(+) Sherry Mathews


-
The Somayas have collected signatures of people who support the project. She
showed a diagram of the homes who support the project.


(+) Arvind Lyer - Project Architect


-
The drawings were done per code. The project meets code requirements. He has
managed to get a letter from the previous architect who designedthe building
which states that the building was done to code for that particular year.


-
Someone stated that dirt was being put in the back and raising the ground.
These are just misconceptions that neighbors have come up with.


(+) Jitu Somaya- Project Owner


-
He would like to request the Commission to approve his project.


-
He made a mistake and has paid the price. He apologizes for the mistake he
made.


-
He has caused a lot of pain to himself and his family.


-
This time, he is here not because of the penthouse but for straightening the
roof.


ACTION: 
Take DR and place conditions on
approval of permit (add sidings on all exposed sides, no penthouse; require
that plans be stamped, any modifications have to come back for further Planning
Commission action; report back tothe Commission in a 6 month period (under

He has lived on Carolina for 5 years.


-
He is 100 feet uphill from the proposed project. There are concerns about fire
safety lane. He has concerns about the other downhill properties.


-
He first requested to have building lowered. This idea was rejected. Then he
requested to have the roof tapered and that was rejected as well.


(+) Jerry Agusta - Owner


-
He submitted signatures of support from neighbors.


-
He has been a builder in San Francisco since 1991. He thought that this was a
non-controversial project.


-
This building is less than 25 x 25 feet.


-
He doesn ?t understand the view issue from his neighbor.


-
He has worked hard to compromise and make the project fit into the
neighborhood.


(+) Jonathan Pearlman - Project Architect


-
Using Mr. Fray ?s diagram to show that he has a very substantial view. It is
amazing that he is requesting modification.


-
Across the street, every single building has a flat roof yet on the side of the
street where the project will be constructed, there is a very mixed character.


(+) Haily Parsons


-
She has watched the property owner bend over backwards to try to deal with the
neighbors issues.

NEW DEYOUNG MUSEUM PROJECT
, 
Findings Regarding
Planning Code Section 295 (Sunshine Ordinance).
 The proposed project would
demolish and reconstruct the M.H. DeYoung Museum on the site of the existing
DeYoung Museum in Golden Gate Park. The project would include demolition of
eight existing buildings, totaling approximately 230,000 square feet, which
compose the DeYoung Museum and the Asian Art Museum. (The Asian Art Museum will
move to the Civic Center.) The new building would include two main levels above
grade, one level below grade, with a varying roof height ranging from 33 to 48
feet, and a 160-foot tower at the northeast corner of the project site. The
building would increase current DeYoung Museum gallery and exhibition space at
the site from theexisting 37,000 sf to total about 75,000 sf. The project would
remove the85 existing paved parking spaces for museum staff, currently on the
easternside of the museum, and would not provide replacement parking. The
project site is within the P (Public Use) zoning district and within an OS
(OpenSpace) Height and Bulk District; Assessor's Block 1700, Lot 1, bounded
tothe north and east by John F. Kennedy Drive, to the south by Tea Garden
Driveand to the west by the Hagiwara Japanese Tea Garden. Section 295 of
thePlanning Code requires, prior to approval of the project, that a
determinationbe made that shading from the structure will not have a
significant and adverseeffect on lands under the jurisdiction of the Recreation
and Park Department. The Commission shall make this determination in a joint
hearing with theRecreation and Park Commission to adopt implementation
criteria.

for Discretionary Review of BPA No. 9912564, proposing to construct a
third-story addition at the rear of the existing two-story, single-family
dwelling within RH-1 (Residential, House, One-Family) District and a 40-X
Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary
Recommendation: It is the Department ?s view that the proposed third floor
addition is within the buildable area of the lot and meets the minimum criteria
of the volume and mass of the Residential Design Guidelines. The issue of
light, air and view from the site of the Discretionary Review requester ?s
building is not compelling enough to warrant a disapproval of the proposed
third floor addition. The Department therefore recommends that the Commission
do not take a Discretionary Review and approve the project as proposed.

Planning Commission consideration of adoption
proposed changes to the Rules for the Office Development Annual Limitation
Program.


 


SPEAKER(S):


Sue Hestor


-
Need to have a lot of amendments to this study.


-
Understand that Prop. M priority policy had been amended by Prop L.


-
Staff has the Prop M material in the computer as does every developer in town
who come within their Prop M policies; standards are different.


-
Are EIRs complete?


-
It is not an option to do a beauty contest, it is not a nice idea, it is the
law.


-
Need to have a full report from the City Attorney ?s Office.


-
The department is now going to have to check the EIRs.


Tom Sullivan


-
He would like to request an annual allocation limitation.


-Their
situation is unique in regards to the project at First and Howard, and this
would be an 

appropriate action for two primary reasons:


1.
Submitted an application for entire four buildings 9/99. Commission made all
supporting findings and granted section 309 approval for all four buildings in
March of this year, but granted annual allocation limitation for three
buildings, specifically for buildings 2, 3, & 4. 


2.
The last building, building #1 has already been subject to the reviewdescribed
in the director ?s memorandum, therefore believes that including it in the
evaluation process being considered today is unnecessary. 


-
The Commission prefers to restrict the allocation in the March approval of
buildings 2 and 3 because of concerns regarding land banking. He believes that
this will not be the case. This is one of the most significant leases in the
City. This will be the largest commitment to the City made by a Silicon Valley
base technology company.


-
He would like to thank the Commission


-
He would like to request that Building #1 be scheduled on a Planning Commission
agenda.


Unknown Speaker


-
There are two new criteria spoken to, one of them is the one about projects
that had been before the Commission for consideration at a prior date; the
other is about art being supplied if it is not required.


-
Office buildings in a C-3 zone are required to have art space.


Deborah Walker


-
She would like to reiterate some of the concerns of Ms. Hestor.


-
It would be a good gesture at this point and pause, and do what the public has
asked.


Erick Quesada


-
Section B, regarding housing policies, is there an input from the Mayor ?s
Office?


Debra Stein


-
There has been an inverted omission on the list of small buildings - 500 Pine
Street should be added to this table. 


-
This draft is preference for a project that already had Planning Commission
action. This means you have a bad project that had an EIR certified that failed
for approval this year and somehow automatically get a higher rating next year.



-
She has concerns about the revisions with regard to housing providing
preference for a project that include construction housing.


-
Urges Commission not to adopt any kind of preference for projects thatare not
good enough for approval.


-
Housing language should be amended.


-
Should not restrict or discourage projects in the commercial court in the C-3
zones.


-
Incentive or advantage to projects that do not currently have public art or
open space requirements.


Jim Reuben


-
If indeed Prop L pass, it is the law that there are things to be incorporated.
We would do whatever is necessary to comply with whatever requirements might be
added.


-
All of the projects on the list are ready to go.


-
Process be accelerated not delayed.


-
Ms. Hestor was regrettably correct in regards to 2550 Cesar Chavez and601 King,
both of which his office has been representing. This office couldhave a problem
if indeed Prop L. pass.

-
This was initiated with the concerns of neighbors in the area.


-
Supervisor Becerril had several meetings to find out the exact the concerns and
comments from the neighbors.


(+)Phillip Fate


-
This is the most important housing issue since the Commission enacted the 1978
North of Market Special Use District. That legislation insure thatit would
remain a residential neighborhood.


-
Neighbors should not be evicted.


-
The bottom line is that the Commissioners would not like an all night venue
right next to their bedrooms.


Edith Laderback


-
When this district was named the Tenderloin, it was to describe the more
desirable section in the heart of the City.


-
The area deteriorated into a district permitted with the worst elements of

-
In recent years, the Tenderloin has worked hard to outgrow these destructive
activities.


-

-
Please don ?t let the Tenderloin go back to the wasteland that it is rapidly

-
Misconception about what it is going on at night in the Tenderloin.


-
Need places for young people to go at night.


-
Night hour people are not some sort of freaks, weirdos; most of them are people
who work hard during the day, and structure their life to go out at night.


-
Do not put restrictions on a small business.


-
Preserve and promote late night option, to keep San Francisco the amazing City
it has been since the Gold Rush.


(-) Tarrence Allen


-
He is a property owner in the tenderloin. He faces the economic reality of this
interesting


neighborhood
everyday.


-
The Moratorium district has been closed for two years to a ban for after hours
activities.


-
If there were going to be huge problems with this legislation, the problems
would come up in areas outside of the moratorium area.


-
If you adopt the Conditional Use requirements for after hours you willbegin to
stifle the economic fatally which is beginning to gain back thevery area of San
Francisco, that needs it the most.

about the amount of time it would take to process this legislation. Supervisor
Becerril

Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application No. 200003134135 proposing
to reduce the number of legal dwelling units in a building from five to three
in an RH-1 (Residential, House, One-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk
District. As a part of this proposal, one illegal dwelling unit would also be
removed.


Preliminary
Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and approve a modified project
reducing the number of legal dwelling units from five to four.


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Desmond Hayes - Co-Owner


-
Reducing it to three units - we are not taking any units out of the market.


-
Building was originally built as a duplex.


-
No permit has ever been issued to allow five units.


-
Planning Department has approved the designation of three units, except that
they are basing their objections on City policies that opposes the reduction on
affordable housing 



- his nephew and his niece are living in the units.


(-) Patrick Hayes - Co-Owner


-
His children are the ones who live in the unit.


(+) Edward Manor


-
Voiced his support and concerns.


-
The proposal of reducing from five existing units to four in a single family
zone, is not a 

conformity use.


-
Concerned about this setting a dangerous precedent for the Planning Commission
to consider disallowing other code requirements such as parking, etc.


Sabrina Holman


-
She does not oppose the remodel of the house since it needs to be repaired.


-
She would like the Commission to ask the following: 1) present a clearand
honest assessment of the scope of the work to be done and a reasonableaccurate
time frame; 2) make sure that the rear of the building meets thecode and rules
for the lot size; 3) protect the children in the neighborhoodagainst led.
