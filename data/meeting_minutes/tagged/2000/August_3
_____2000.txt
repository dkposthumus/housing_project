procedures for addressing modifications to plans after they have been approved
by the Planning Commission.


 


Larry Badiner:


- They have been working with staff
specifically on this item.
? 
They have
had a stamp in the office for a number of years.
? 
The procedure has been clarified in the last week.
? 
An e-mail was sent to all planners requiring
that they stamp both the application and all elevations and plans of a project
that has come to the Commission with the following items: Aapproved pursuant to
CPC Discretionary Review action, all revisions should be referred to DCP@.
? 
He has asked staff to follow up on this
matter and date and initial the stamp as they put it on.
? 
He will be working with DBI to ensure that
these items come back to us.
? 
He will
follow up on this and provide reports on items as they come up.
? 
Also, a notation will be included in the
permit tracking computer program to augment the hard copy.


Gerald Green:


- Although this is nothing new, Commission
Chinchilla should receive credit for initiating this process.


- Unfortunately, in the last year,
this method has been applied inconsistently.


- We are taking steps to improve and
do a better job.










Patricia Vaughey


- One of the problems she has with
the stamp is that certain people get copies of the stamp and use them at their
own discretion when it?s convenient.


- She suggests that different color
ink be used for different days.


- There are still problems with lost
drawings.


- People who are repeat offenders
should have double or triple the fine.


Roberta Caravelli


- Internally, both the Building
Department and the Planning Department need to watch for staff who are
inconsistent about applying the procedures.


- Procedural disciplinary steps
should be set in place if certain staff members don?t comply with this.

Joe Butler


- He appreciates Mr. Badiner?s eye
on the details.


- The compliance with these matters
is not hard to do.

This has more to do with
the attitude of the contractor and the inability of the project sponsor to get
compliance from his contractor.


He looks forward to having these
problems go away.


Net Topham - Project Sponsor


- He is working very hard to make
sure every last detail of these conditions are approved.
? 
He met with Mr. Butler and they will

129 RANDALL STREET
, south side between Whitney and
Chenery Streets, Lot 038 in Assessor?s Block 6663 -- Request for Discretionary
Review of BPA No. 9911578, proposing to demolish the existing building and
construct a new two-unit building in a RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family)
District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Do not
take Discretionary Review, approve project.


Prior Action: Public comment was
closed at the February 17, 2000 hearing.
?

The Commission continued the item to allow further discussion between
the project sponsor and neighbors
.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of
July 27, 2000).


Note: On June 15, 2000, the
Commission passed the following motions:










1st Motion
:
?

Take Discretionary Review with the following changes: 1) set back 8 feet
further on the 4th floor; 2) project sponsor to continue to work with staff on
architectural detailing of the facade with specific reference to the skylight
on the 3rd floor. Vote of +2 -2.
?

Commissioners Antenore and Joe voted no.
? 
Commissioners Theoharis, Martin and Mills were absent.


2nd Motion
: Take Discretionary Review with the
following changes: 1) remove 4th floor 2) modify the front facade to fit into
the character of the neighborhood.
? 
Vote
+2 -2.
? 
Commissioners Chinchilla and
Richardson voted no.
?? 
Commissioners
Theoharis, Martin and Mills were absent.


Note
: On July 27, 2000, the
representative of the project sponsor submitted revised plans.
? 
The Commission continued the matter for one
week so they, staff, and the Discretionary Review Requestor would have an
opportunity to review the new submission.


 


SPEAKER(S):


Brett Gladstone - representing
project sponsor


- New changes are as follows:
setting back the top floor an additional 8 feet; making the facade out of
plaster to look like the surrounding buildings; change the front to show
cornices; and change the front to eliminate wood siding.


- Many of the neighbors did receive
the revised plans, although one neighbor mentions that he did not receive it.


John O?Reilley - Project Sponsor


- A transcript of the last hearing
which states the requested changes was submitted to the commissioners.
? 
The only item which was not addressed was that
the entire floor be removed.


- They have met with the neighbors
many times and have had hearings a few times and there was never an intent
expressed to remove the 4th floor.


Paul Curtis


-None of the changes made have been
major.


- The revised plans don?t say
anything about the interior of the house.


- There will be 7 master bedrooms
yet there is no way of knowing if the changes refer to a reduction of bedroom
sizes.


- There is another house which is
being built on this street and there has been no problems at all with that
project since it totally complies with the neighborhood requirements.


- The current project is still too
tall and too big.


- He hopes that the commissioners
have had an opportunity to come to the site of the proposed project.


Paul Travis


- Two aspects need to be clarified:
1) a meeting which was held after the last hearing just outside of the
chambers, is not a community meeting although it has been classified as one;
2)the plans which have been submitted address the view of the project from one
narrow position. 


Art Bender


- The compromise of the project
sponsor in no way addresses the concerns of the neighbors.
? 
The neighbors are still strongly opposed.


Bill Petri


- There have not been any meetings
since the last hearing.


- The issues have not been
addressed.


- They are asking for a meeting so
that all the items can be addressed.


- Meeting in the hall after the last
hearing is not considered a meeting.

585 LAIDLEY STREET
, south side between Castro and
Roanoke Streets, Lot 025 in Assessor?s Block 6727 - Request for Discretionary
Review of building permit application No. 9923677 of proposal to construct a
third-story addition on top of an existing two-story single-family residence in
an RH-1 (House, One-Family) District and 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Do not
take Discretionary Review and approve building permit application as submitted.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of
July 20, 2000)


Note: On May 18, 2000, following
testimony, the Commission closed the public hearing and passed a motion of
intent to take Discretionary Review and approve the project with design changes
--
? 
show new peaked roof design, add
dormers to the rear, and setback building on the side of the DR requestor.


 


Andy Forest


- The project is a 2 story building
and plain stucco facade.


- They have gone through several
changes.


- Staff has been working very hard
to keep abreast of all the details.


- The new design will show a slopped
roof to be more in character with the neighborhood; the north side of the
structure will be set back, and dormers were inserted on the 3rd floor to allow
headroom which is impinged by the slopped roof.
? 
He also kept the dormers away from the north side, which is the
DR filer?s side.


- He has followed the Commission?s
recommendations from the last hearing.


Geraldine Foster


- The engineer?s proposed changes
does not meet the Commissions mandate.


- The proposed peaked roof variation
is still too high.


- More architectural changes will
not legalize the project.


- To comply with Commissioners?
requests, the roof slope should start at the floor of the 3rd level, not 5 feet
high.
? 
The side setback at the rear
should remain.
? 
The third floor facade
should only have one small window and two or three dormers can be added.
? 
The peak of the roof should be limited to 30
feet as promised.
? 
It would provide the
owner with more headroom.


- These changes will diminish the
possibility of a future creation of a separate and illegal unit.


Patricia Caravelli


- If the 4th story on 129 Randall
Street is out-of-character, then the 3rd floor on Laidley is out-of-character
as well.










Mr. Alvarenga


-He is a native San Franciscan and
grew up in this house.
? 
He would like to
provide the same for his children.


- There are only two bedrooms, the
addition would be to provide a space for his children.
? 
If the sloping roof starts at the base of
the 2nd floor, this would give him no floor plan which was the whole idea for
this project.

SPEAKER(S):


(-) Lee Molton


- He has been a resident of the
neighborhood for 13 years.


- He is against the fact that this
project is designated as live/work.


- When live work was created, it was
to preserve diminishing large space for artists in industrial zones.


- He is not sure why the City or the
Planning Commission is allowing housing to be built under live/work.
? 
He strongly disagrees with that.


- Housing patterns in San Francisco
has advocated setbacks and open space between buildings and this pattern is not
doing that.


- The Commission could help the
neighbors by looking at the pattern.


- Census data is being used from 10
years ago so it?s not up to date.

The
neighborhood has changed dramatically in the last 10 years.


- He wants to be a good neighbor
with the developer.


(-)

- They are not against development

the last 30 years.
?

agreed to do this.

This would involve
eliminating two guestrooms, brining the total number of guestrooms from 11 to

the department?s recommendations with the following modifications: 1)
continuation of the use of not only 2 and 4 but also 5 Charlton Ct.; 2)

required zoning; 3) she is agreeable with the conversion of the two eliminated
guestrooms to residential use.

- He and his wife purchased the Inn
in 1987.

legal significance of the zoning disclosed on the 3 R reports they
received.
? 


- They believed incorrectly that the
Inn which had then been in operation for about 25 years had always been a Bed
and Breakfast Inn.

license with the city, a tax registration certificate and have paid hotel tax
since the purchase of the Inn.

Public Health issued a permit to operate and a certificate of sanitary
inspection authorizing food preparation.

problems to continue running the Inn as is.

Although they eventually obtained permits, they realize that
after-the-fact permits are not the same as obtaining the permit before starting
the work.

(+) Daniela Kirshenbaum - member of

Commission to approve their permits to continue operating is contingent on a
few considerations.

This unit should be
reverted to a 1 single family dwelling.
?

it?s own merit?

before retrofitting the tower.

never pulled by the contractor.

Re: 22-30 Alta


- EIR does not adequately respond to

the

rejected this project because it has not been consistent with the Historic
District.


- They are in negotiations with the

- Would like the Commission to not

Joe Latro - Speaking on Behalf of
the Telegraph Hill Dwellers, Alta-Filbert Preservation Association, and Friends
of the Garden
 


Re: 22-30 Alta


- The Landmarks Board rejected the
proposed alternative called C in the final EIR


- This can
?
t be a proper bases for comparison


- Would like to focus on the shadow


- The lot has shade on the garden
during 26 days of the year.
? 
If C goes
in, it will increase the shade to 115 days.
?

There will be 89 additional shade days per year.


- The final EIR should not be
approved.


Debra Stein, representing property
owner at 22 Alta Street


- The Board
?
s opinion is not evidence of significance
of environmental impact.
? 
The CEQA
? 
charge to the Planning Commission is to use
its own judgment.


- The project is compared to the
former McNear building and not to the empty site.
? 
However, for informational purposes the DEIR also compares the
project with the McNear building, but for compliance with CEQA, there is
compared data with the empty site.


- There is concern that alternative
C somehow presents substantial new information that requires a recirculation
and reevaluation of the environmental review document


- The new alternative is smaller
than the prime project that is being evaluated.

Update City List of Categorical Exemptions
from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA); Citywide
.
?

The proposal is to adopt an updated list of types of projects that are
categorically exempt from environmental review pursuant to the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
? 
CEQA
and the Guidelines for implementation require that local agencies adopt a list
of types of projects that are exempt from environmental review.
? 
Such a list must show activities at the
local level that fall within each of the classes of exemptions set forth in the
CEQA Guidelines, and must be consistent with the letter and the intent of the
Guidelines.
? 
The Planning Commission
adopted such list in 1981.
? 
Since that
time, CEQA and the Guidelines pertaining to categorical exemptions have been
revised.
? 
The City
?
s list currently proposed for
adoption has been updated and amended to be consistent with changes in CEQA
statutes and Guidelines.
? 
Chapter 31 of
the Administrative Code (Section 31.17) requires that modifications to such
list be adopted as administrative regulations by resolution of the Planning
Commission after a public hearing.
? 


Preliminary Recommendation: Adoption
of Updated List of Categorical Exemptions.


 


SPEAKER(S):


Don Andrini, Architectural Heritage
Association


- Class 31 Historic Resource Restoration
Rehabilitation exempts projects if they are constructed in a manner that is
consistant with the Secretary of the Interior
?
s standard for the treatment of historic
properties
? 
with guidelines for
preserving/rehabilitating and reconstructing historic buildings.


- In California the Office of
Historic Preservation is charged with pre-construction and post-construction
review.


Aaron Peskin - Telegraph Hill
Dwellers Neighborhood Association


- Will give written comments to Environmental
Officer next week 


Sue Hestor


- Glad that this item is being
continued for a week.


- it would be very helpful if, in
addition to making important documents available early enough to obtain to
review, they would be advertised in advanced.


- The department has not decided on
what is the determination of dot.coms.


- The Department does not have
General Plan evaluation.


Alice Barkley


- She supports adoption of the
categorical exemptions.


- It is a very important exception
being adopted by the Commission.


- There is no inconsistency.


- Adopt the list as circulated.


- This hearing was mentioned more
than once in public


John Bardis


- The BOS legislation is considered
the chapter 31 update that Sup. Kaufman submitted, which was then submitted to
the department as a staff report.


- There is a horrendous oversite
that a piece of legislature like this go unnoticed.


- The BOS will recognize this
oversite and send the documents back to the Department.

Request for Project
Authorization under Planning Code Sections 320-325 (Office Development
Limitation Program) for 49,950 gross square feet of office space.
? 
On November 4, 1999, the Planning Commission
approved Case No. 1998.497X, per Section 309 of the Planning Code, to alter the
existing 6-story, approximately 286,991 square-foot office building at 215
Fremont Street.
? 
The approval of Case
No. 1998.497X included the demolition of an existing 4-story penthouse
structure, the conversion of 21,660 square feet of existing ground floor office
space to retail space, and the construction of a new full seventh floor and a
partial eighth floor, resulting in a net addition of 24,950 gross square feet
of office space.
? 
The current project
proposes to construct an additional 25,000 gross square feet of office space on
a new partial floor within the 7th floor of the building at 215 Fremont Street,
therefore bringing the total net new office space to 49,950 square feet.
? 
The project lies within a C-3-O (SD)
(Downtown Office Special Development) District and within a 350-S and
200-SHeight and Bulk Districts.
?

Pursuant to Planning Code Section 313 the Department has determined that
the project would result in the net addition of approximately 49,950 square
feet of gross floor area office use, requiring compliance with the Office
Affordable Housing Production Program.

building is very important to them.

?
s Block 1085 -- Request for Discretionary Review of
BPA No. 200006304172, proposing a retail store (BEVERAGES AND MORE) of
approximately 5,998 square feet on the ground floor of a newly constructed
four-story building within an NC-3 (Moderate-Scale Neighborhood Commercial)
District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District. 


Preliminary Recommendation: The
Planning Department recommends that no Discretionary Review be taken and that
the building permit application be approved as proposed.


 


SPEAKER(s):


(-) Ron Pierce - President of the
Jordan Park Neighborhood Association


- He comes with no malice to
Beverages and More










- He opposes this case primarily
because of the parking and traffic impact in the neighborhood.


- Stanyan is one of many major
corridors.


- This is a very hazardous and
dangerous location.


- There is a loading dock which will
cause traffic problems when delivery trucks are trying to back up into a small
space.
? 
The driver would have to be an
excellent driver to back up in one shot.


- Parking within the neighborhood
and the Lone Mountain neighborhood is very difficult.


- They would like to limit impact on
the neighborhood.
? 
It is a quiet
neighborhood and they would like to keep it that way.


- Please look at the negative impact
and suggestions from the neighborhood.


(-) Supervisor Yaki


- He is here to speak on behalf on
the Discretionary Review requestor.


- Beverages and More is a good
commercial neighbor, yet this type of store requires its customers to drive
their cars.


- This store is not like a
Blockbuster where one can walk and drop off their movies.
? 
Purchases from Beverages and More could
require a car to be driven to transport them.


- The Coronet Theater will be
demolished and a large use will be constructed there.


- It is important that we consider
constructing housing in major transit areas.


(-) David Heller - President of the
Geary Boulevard Merchants Association


- Their concerns are about safety
and traffic.


- Parking is a major problem in the
Geary Street area.


- He sees a potential disaster
happening if this project is approved.


- This will have a devastating
affect on their neighborhood.


(-) William Goodson


- To get to the parking spaces that
Beverages and More is providing, you have to drive down below street level
through a passage way that is 14 feet wide.
?

An SUV is about 6 1/2 feet wide which means that anyone who has a car
larger than a Geo, Saturn, or Toyota would have to park on the street.


- It is illogical for such a small
space to be used for in/out cars.


(-) Bob Lee - President of the
Francisco Heights Neighborhood Association


- Supervisor Yaki mentioned that we
need to look into the future.


- UCFS is adding many residential
units.


- My son was injured at this
intersection.


(-) Michael Sullivan


- Has lived on Stanyan street for
about 40 years.


- He works out of his home.


- Every day of the week he hears
screeching brakes.


- He and his wife have a concern of
the traffic safety at that intersection.


- Difficult to find parking in this
area.


- This store will not be a store
which would just attract people from the neighborhood.
? 
It will bring people from various parts of
the City.


(-) Ron Miguel - President of the
Planning Association of the Richmond


- This is a situation where a building
was not designed to effectively handle the commercial activity it will
generate, nor the resulting parking issues 


- Beverages is ill suited for this
neighborhood.


- He has been a customer of
Beverages and More but this site is not good for the neighborhood.


(-) Ron Konapouski


- Has lived in the Richmond for
about 30 years.


- He echos everything that people
have mentioned.










(-) Ralf Sisfek


- Lives on Anza Street


- He shares the concerns which have
been expressed.
? 
He knows the intersection
very well.
? 
It already is a strange
intersection.


- The intersection is very narrow as
well as subject to fast traffic.


Tailor Nagle


- 30 years resident of Jordan Park


- His mother lives on Jordan Avenue.


- His concerns are about traffic.


- This project is not appropriate
and/or compatible to the neighborhood.


John Steuart


- Has lived in the Richmond for 12
years.


- He is most familiar with the
Beverages and More in Oakland.


Rob Isimarkola - Represents the
Richmond ? Neighborhood Association


- There are safety and parking
issues.


(+) Andrew Junius - Reuben &
Alter - Representing Beverages and More


- This project is a fully
code-compliant use. 


- We talked about the Trader Joe
issue in greater detail in our report.


- Project designed so there will not
be a traffic problem.


- This store is located in an NC-3
district.


(+) Tim Earny - Wilbir, Smith
Associates


- They did count about 500 vehicles
going to the Trader Joe store.


- A parking study was done and
parking conditions were looked at 


- The addition of about 20 -30
vehicles would not substantially worsen the actual traffic conditions.


- Field counts were not conducted at
other Beverages and More locations.


(+) Ban Hudson - President and CEO
of Beverages and More


- Why does Beverages and More want
to open a store at this location?
? 
They
don
'
t believe that the
majority of the people are against their store.


- They are a neighborhood specialty
store.
? 
They assist the
neighborhoods.
? 
The neighborhood will
appreciate the service they provide.


- Traffic and Parking is an issue in
Northern California.
? 
This area has been
zoned for retail.
? 
Their retail project
fits within the guidelines and the structure of where they propose moving into.


(+) Sharon Mark


- Owns one of the building in the
area which has 33 units.


- Please deny DR and approve store.


(+) Wilfred Wong


- He has been a resident of San
Francisco for 49 years.


- He has owned a store at Ashbury
and Market for many years.


- He has been watching this company
for many years.


- This company is a high quality
retail store.


(+) David Richards - Officer of
Beverages an More


- There are 45,000 members just in
San Francisco City and County.


- There are 14,367 members of the
Bev Club.


- They have talked to their club
members and they are asking for this store because it
?
s convenient.


(+) Mark Wasack


- 20 year resident of the area.


- He is an attorney and his firm has
done work for Beverages and More










- He shops at Trader Joes, and he
eats at the restaurants in the area along with his family.


- The products that Beverages and
More provide are good quality.


- This would be a good addition to
the neighborhood.


(+) Randy Kaplan


- He is a small business owner


- This would help the neighbors.


(+) Michelle Myers


- She is here to support the
Beverages and More project.


- She drives to Blockbuster or to
Mels Diner even though they are close to her house.


- If she needs to get some ice cream
or some beer, she would go to the corner store.
? 
She would go to Beverages and More to get the higher end
specialty goods.


(+)
?

Hudson


- He is in favor of this project.


- If he wants to get more bulk items
he would like to have a choice and go to Beverages and More.


- This is not a quiet area, its a
commercial area.


(+) Matt Alexander


- He and his family are customers of
many of the retail stores on Geary Boulevard


(+) Jessica Hessman


- She agrees with other speakers in
support of BevMo.


- She believes that the benefits
outweigh the costs. 


(+) Steven McCleran - one of the
founders of Beverages and More


- The company did an analysis and a
comparison of the various Beverages and More.


- The design of the store at this
site will fit the circumstances of the area.


- Since 1994, not one single
independent liquor store has closed their doors because of Beverages and More,
simply because BevMore are a different kind of store.


(+) Joe O
'
Donahue - Residential Builders


- It makes sense for Beverages and
More to be located there.

Kay Lamming


Re: 268 Chennery Street


- She was the Discretionary Review requestor on this case on
May 27, 1999.
? 
This case was the focus
of much opposition.


- The Commission voted to accept the recommendations from
staff.


- She appealed the matter and the decision is pending.


- The reason she is bringing this matter to the Commission
is because the plans for this project on file at the Planning Department do not
reflect the decision of the Commission.


- She would like to know what the true plans are and that an
investigation be done. 


Judy Langley - Webster Street Historic District


Re:
? 
Smith-Kettlewell
Eye Research Institute


- She lives near the California Pacific Medical Center


- Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute is one of the
affiliates of the Center.


- This institute now owns 6 Victorian houses in the area
which they have turned into offices; despite the fact that at least 4 of the
houses are zoned for residential only.
?

Many of these houses are becoming deteriorated.


- She would like the Commission to preserve these Victorian
houses and keep them for residential use only.


Beverly McCallister - Friends of the Webster Street Historic
District


Re: Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute


?
?????????? 
- The Webster Street Historic
District will be very much affected if this Institute is granted a conditional
use permit.


- These San Francisco Victorian homes should be preserved as
residences.


Nelson Wild - Friends of the Webster Street Historic
District


RE: Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute
?????? 










- This institute knows that they are violating the law.


- They should be stopped.


Heidi Engelbrechten - Friends of the Webster Street Historic
District


Re: Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute


- She doesn?t believe that offices belong in the Webster
Street Historic District.


- She wants the Institute to restore these Victorian houses
and have people living in there and not working. 


Donald Langley - Friends of the Webster Street Historic
District


Re: Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute


- He would like the Commission to enforce the zoning
ordinance and return the Victorian houses to residential use.


- Dr. Alan Scott, the head of Smith-Kettlewell, mentioned
that his organization had been in the area for many years.
? 
Yet, having been around for many years like
Smith-Kettlewell does not give it the right to change the look of the
neighborhood.


- He would like to support planning staff and support the
zoning ordinance.


Matt Rowe - Haight Ashbury Youth Outreach


RE: 2500 Market Street


- He works with the Haight Ashbury Youth Outreach Team.


- He supports the transitional housing at 2500 Market
Street.


- Transitional housing projects are very important to the
city because they provide shelter for the homeless.


- Agencies that work with homeless are happy to work with
transitional houses.


Bill Eddleman - Webster Street Historic District


RE: Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute
?????? 


- Smith-Kettlewell has been converting the neighborhood to a
medical center.


- These buildings which have been illegally used should be
returned to housing use.


Paul Horcher - Director of Solid Waste Management Company


RE: Sanitary Fill Company
???????? 


- He has to divert trash by 50% this year.


- If they fail to meet their goal they will be charged
$10,000 per day.


John Bardis


RE: Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute
?????? 


- The neighborhood, at that time, supported the building of
the California Pacific Medical Center.


- This institution is violating planning laws and their
master plan.
? 
The Commission has to take
some action regarding what people have asked for with California Pacific
Medical Center.


- Urges the Commission to get some word to the Board and to
the Building Inspection Department regarding the enforcement of the
Institutional Master Plan ordinance and zoning laws.


Ralph Oroquita


Re:
? 
Sanitary Waste
Management Company


- This project has been going on for the past 10 years.
? 
There is no emergency.


- A 2-week continuance shouldn?t hurt the company in any
way.


Patricia Vaughey


RE: Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute
?????? 


- There is a vacant hospital at Mt. Zion.


- Is there any way that Smith-Kettlewell can move in there
instead of moving into houses?

Appeal of Preliminary Negative
Declaration

Assessor's Block
4991/Lots 7, 8, 9 and 82 in San Francisco County; and Assessor's Block 152/Lots
030, 340 and 220 (partial) in San Mateo County. The Sanitary Fill Company seeks
to revise its Solid Waste Facility Permit to allow for: (1) the removal of
scheduling restrictions on refuse fleet hauling; (2) an increase in permitted
vehicle trips per day; (3) approval to stage and handle source-separated
organic waste as a separate waste stream; (4) approval to enclose the
construction and demolition debris sort line and increase the hours of sort
line operation; and (5) removal of the Household Hazardous Waste Collection
Facility from the Solid Waste Facility Permit.
?

Preliminary Recommendation: Uphold Preliminary Negative Declaration


(Continued from Regular Meeting of July 13, 2000)


 


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Robert McCarthy - McCarthy and Schwartz - representing
Norcal Waste Systems and its subsidiary Sanitary Fill Company.


- This case is a very limited matter.
? 
The City is under an obligation to reach a
50% diversion of its refuse in order to stop using landfill and start recycling
more.


- This facility would expand the amount of green waste that
comes out of the refuse.
? 
It?s not an
increase in the garbage.
? 
It?s just to
be able to pull it out and stream it so it?s separate and
? 
recycled in a compost facility offsite.
? 
It will also enclose the sort line that is
used for construction and debris.
? 
This
would take the workers out of the elements and will benefits the neighbors
since it will reduce dust, noise and glare.


- This facility operates 24 hours already and will add 12
employees during off hours.


(-) Ralf Oroquita


- His community is now 50% Asian.
? 
He has not seen any publications in Chinese to inform these residents.


- There are many garbage and recycling facilities in their
neighborhood.


- This project requires an EIR and a real plan should be
carried out to inform the neighbors.


- The project is too big.
?

Many homes and yards can be built in this location.


- The Commission can help by postponing this development in
order to have more discussions.


(+/-)
 
Don Bertone - President of the Little Hollywood Neighborhood
Association
 
and the Chair of the Planning Commission?s
? 
Local Health Risk Assessment Committee


- The Local Health Risk Committee is now dormant, but
before, it used to study the systems plan and the household hazardous waste
component.


- They had always sought to deal with this expansion.


- They had hoped to get more consideration by the Commission
through an EIR.


- They have never been in any dialog or meeting regarding
this plan.


- Considering that after many years, they had sought to
participate in meetings with organizations, just this morning they came up with
a plan.


- They had also requested a continuation.


(-) Rob Gibson - Member of the Little Hollywood Neighborhood
Association


- He would like to get some support to protest this project.


- He and his neighbors have been dealing with this situation
for 25 years.

proposed project would demolish and reconstruct the M.H. DeYoung Museum on the
site of the existing DeYOUNG Museum in Golden Gate Park.
? 
The project would include demolition of
eight existing buildings, totaling approximately 230,000 square feet, which
compose the DeYOUNG Museum and the Asian Art Museum.
? 
(The Asian Art Museum will move to the Civic Center.)
? 
The new building would include two main
levels above grade, one level below grade with a varying roof height ranging
from 33 to 48 feet, and a 160‑foot tower at the northeast corner of the
project site.
? 
The building would
increase current DeYoung Museum gallery and exhibition space at the site from
the existing 37,000 sf to total about 75,000 sf.
? 
The project would remove the 85 existing paved parking spaces for
museum staff, currently on the eastern side of the museum, and would not
provide replacement parking.

Preliminary
Recommendation:
? 
No Action Required


 


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Danny Leone -
North Beach Chamber of Commerce


- He supports the new
design of the museum.
? 
The new design
will offer more exhibit space,
? 
more
parking space, and a view which it didn?t have before.


(-) Joseph Fusco -
Chairman of a new organization called People for a New De Young Museum.


- There are a number of
people from the Sunset District who were not notified and did not receive the
Draft EIR.


- His organization does
not take a stand on the design of the new building, their comments involve
context.


- He would like to
request a continuance.


- The report does not
reflect the impact on the environment.
?

It is full of weak assumptions, mistaken conclusions, lack of
neutrality, and disingenuous use of wording and graphics.


- An EIR is supposed to
be an objective assessment of the project?s impact.
? 
It reads like it was prepared by, rather than for, the Fine Arts
Museum of San Francisco.


- Fine Arts of San
Francisco is just trying to build a high rise.


(+) Margarete P.
Archer


- There is one
significant change.
? 
The square footage
will increase.
? 
Some people don?t like
the shape of the tower and the fact that it will move.
? 
The tower moves around very quietly.
? 
The shade will change and it will be very
beneficial to the park.
? 


- In regards to the
parking, she believes that a garage is needed.
?

Some people don?t believe there is a need for parking, other people don?t
believe anything should be built at all.


- The fact that the
tower will move around will be fascinating to children who come to the museum.


- There are a lot of
parking problems in the City.
? 
On
weekends people park on Lincoln Way and some park in the park.


- She has been devoted
to the museum for a long time and believes that the museum is very valuable.


(+) Jim Killoran -
Asian Art Museum


- The project will be
complete in July of 2002 and will open in the Fall of 2002.


- The schedules for the
Asian and deYoung will overlap.
? 
His
organization is working closely with staff of both museums regarding occupancy
of space for the art pieces.


- The construction
process will adequately abate or mitigate affects on the Asian Art Museum in
regards to noise, dirt, vibration, etc. He would like the EIR to reflect these
situations and state that measures are being taken to deal with these
situations.


(+)
 
Toby Levine


- She read the EIR and
believes that this is a very simple one.


- There are no negative
impacts from this project.


- She hopes that this
project will become a beautiful vehicle for art and for people to come and view
this art.


- Would like to have
Commission certify this EIR.


(+) Sally Ann Ryan -
Art Supervisor of the San Francisco Unified School District


- She supports this
project and is exited about the moving tower which will please children.










- The Board of Education
unanimously passed a resolution to support children to find ways to provide
funds for construction.


- San Francisco is known
for many things, now we have a symbol of the love of the arts but also the
moving tower so they can see the area that the museum encompasses.


(+/-)
 
Ron Miguel - Member of Planning
Association for the Richmond


- The present building
is no longer adequate and is not a historical building.


- He doesn?t have great
disputes with the EIR.
? 
It is a very
simple report.


- He hopes that when the
EIR for the Concourse is done, it
? 
will
be similar to the one for the deYoung Museum.


(+)
 
Jim Chappell - President of SPUR


- He has reviewed the
EIR and believes that the report is quite accurate.


- There is no question
that the existing building must be demolished and replaced.


- The EIR considers
visual quality and shadow issues.
? 
It is
properly conservative in it?s analysis of traffic issues and is adequate for
the park.


(+/-) Pinky Cushner
 - 
Alliance for Golden Gate Park


- Would like to have
case continued since she just received the EIR this morning.


- She is very
experienced in commenting on EIRs.


- She has various
comments regarding issues she would like to have dealt with in the EIR and she
will submit her comments before the deadline.


(+) John Lumis - 
?
California College of Arts and Crafts


- He is convinced that
the majority of the architects in the city will agree with the new design of
the museum.


- This museum will be
friendly to all ages.


(+) Chooi Eng Grosso
- SHARP


- Many people voted to
tax themselves to rebuild the museum in Golden Gate Park.


- When she read the EIR,
she had no problems with it.


(-)
 
Roger Brandon


- The voters of the City
rejected building a new structure twice.


- The design of the
building is not appropriate.


- This building is a
disaster in the making.


(-) Philip Carlton -
Alliance for Golden Gate Park


- He would like the
Commission to reject the EIR.


- The tower will be an
observation tower which therefore will be a land use change since there has
never been an Aobservation@ deck before.
?

Someone will get hurt at this observation deck.


- There are a number of
observation areas throughout San Francisco.
?

There is no need for another one.


- The EIR states that
there will be an additional 300,000 visitors.
?

This number is very low.


- He would like a
description of the land deeded by the BOS, Rec and Park Commission, Planning
Commission and the Charter to the Museum.
?

What is the process for them if they go beyond to acquire this other
land.

- The car wash noise

- Over 90% of the wash
time is done before going into the wash tunnel.
? 
The traffic jams will be created even before cars go into the
wash tunnel. This is in addition to the separate auto detailing area proposed.


(-) Patricia Vaughey


- The negative
declaration is breaking the law.
? 
It
does not follow CEQA.
?? 
It does not
address the rezoning of more property for this site and for the potential use

 - 
Coblins, Patch, Duffy and Bass
- Representing Project Sponsor


- There is fundamental
confusion in the negative declaration appeals and in the comments today regarding
the environmental impacts of the carwash vs. the environmental impacts of the

- This project has been
designed to express concerns about noise and chemical sprays used at the car
wash.


- The capacity of the

report was issued and passed to the Commissioners.


(-)
 
Joe O?Donahue - Residential

- Is it wise to increase
the capacity of what is already an environmental traffic disaster area?


- Pedestrians and/or
handicapped persons cannot walk on the sidewalk that front the carwash.


- This neighborhood is
completely in opposition to this project.
?



- The Mayors office does
not realize the significance of the opposition.


(-) Agar Chakes


- He has driven down Oak

? 
A whole lane of traffic is used
for people trying to get into the car wash.


- The quality of life of

? 
This is not what the City or this Commission
are about.


(-) Jeff Williams -
President of the 425-427 Homeowner?s Association on Scott Street


- He is the other
appellant.


- The Touchless car wash
has been continually breaking all environmental laws, ignoring the neighborhood
and their employees.


- The car wash is also
in violation on the hours of operation.










(-) Tom Coniff -
Lives in the neighborhood


- He agrees with the
previous speakers.


- There are 3 gas
stations surrounding the area of the proposed car wash.
? 
Those alone create a number of traffic
problems.
? 
This is already excessive for

larger problem to an already dangerous situation.

SPEAKER(S):


(+) Art Davis -
Represents Canadian Oil Company (owners of the Touchless Car Wash)


- The carwash has been
at this location for 50 years.


- TCW has been the
winner of many awards voted on by consumers.


- This is not about
increasing the peak capacity of the block.
?

The wash tunnel will not be increased so the capacity of the cars would
remain the same.


- The company would just
like to increase the work area for their employees by adding a break room,
lockers, etc.


- They have had many
community meetings, have listened to the neighbors and are trying to deal with
their concerns.


(+/-) David Gast -
Principal of the Firm of David Gast Architects


- They designed the new
construction to buffer noise, chemicals, etc from the neighbors.


- They have changed the
project to produce a building which is in scale with the rest of the buildings
in the neighborhood.


- They have increased
the area where cars will wait to go into the wash tunnel; this would alleviate
the back up of cars on Oak Street.


- They have worked quite
hard to come up with a proposal which will deal with the concerns of the
neighbors.


(+) Harry O?Brien - 


- An important part of
this project is to make the car wash useful for everyone -- neighbors,
customers, employees.










- Perhaps, in the
history of the carwash, they may not have kept every single promise they have
made.
? 
Yet, they have always tried to be
considerate to the customers and the neighbors.


(+) Javier Calix 


- He is the manager of
the Touchless Car Wash.
? 
He has worked
there for 11 years.


- He is here to
represent the workers of the car wash.


- The workers are very
much in favor of having a place where they can take their breaks and eat their
lunch, as well as lockers to store their belongings.


(+) Robert Bentley


- People who are
opposing this project have been using false information and false tactics.


- The people have
created confusion and hysteria by using false information.

- He is a new resident
to the area.


- The first thing he
found was a good car wash to get his car clean.


- This project helps the

- He supports the car
wash since the changes that they are planning make sense.


- He gets his car washed
there regularly.


(-) Cynthia Marcucci
- Haight/Divisadero Merchant?s Association


- Her organization
opposes the project.


- The car wash is
attracting new customers which will eventually cause more traffic and traffic
problems.


- There has been a
16-year track record in which the owner?s of the car wash has shown that
? 
they have not come through with their
promises.


(-) Mark Garner


- Over the years his
tenants have had many problems with this car wash.


- There were a certain
number of residential units promised yet only a few units were built.


- The trees to buffer
the noise were never built either.


- A fence was supposed
to built as well and it was never built.


(-) Rafael Zocca


- He lives within 50
feet of this project--(he displayed a photograph of a backup of cars trying to
get into the car wash.)


- He has to go into the
middle lane to go into his garage.


- There has been no
peace in this neighborhood.


- The car wash owners
need to realize that neighbors have had many problems with this car wash.


(-) Mary Zocca


- Her backyard is
adjacent to the car wash.
? 
There is a
section where they will be building a park.


- The park will be for
their employees.


- Her fence goes up 6
feet yet the area of the car wash will have to be leveled and a 6 foot fence
added--which will make it a 12 foot fence she will have to look at.


- She wants a right to
privacy and a right to good health.


(-) Homa
Fatalazadelis


- Oak Street is a one
way street, when cars come out of the car wash, people are in so much hurry to
get out of there to get to their next appointment which can cause dangerous
situations.


(-) Patrick Harris


- He has talked to Art
Davis regarding employment.
? 
Yet his
people cannot fill out applications if Mr. Davis is not on the site.
? 


- He would like to have
more community support from the owner of the car wash.


(-) Holly Thuman


- They gathered 300
signatures and everyone was against the expansion of the car wash.










(-) Mark Lorenzer -
Chairman of the Haight/Divisadero Neighbors and Merchant?s Group


- He lives a block away
and has used the car wash yet he has found another car wash that is more
convenient for him.


- He is concerned that
the representatives of the car wash come to the meetings and provide some
information only, and don?t provide the residents with solutions to their
questions and/or issues.


- He has never met the
owner of the car wash.


(-) Richard Kay


- For many years the car
wash management has allowed the problems to get out of control--(he displayed
pictures of cars on the sidewalk and cars parked in areas where it could be
dangerous for pedestrians.)


(-) Jeff Williams


- He lives on Scott
Street and is totally against the expansion of the car wash.


(-) Michael Smithrick


- They gathered about
300 signatures in one day and people were almost fighting to sign.
? 
This proves the fact that there are more
people against the expansion of the carwash than people who support it.


- Expanding the car wash
is supposed to eliminate problems but after analyzing the proposal it doesn?t
appear to reduce any problems at all.


(-) Gary Goad


- If the owners are
going to spend thousands to expand their facility why can?t they spend $100 to
clean their sidewalk?


(-) Brian DeHuff


- He has a tree in his
back yard and one side of the tree is dying because of the sprays that are used
to clean the cars.


(-) Greg Hansen -
Haight/Divisadero Neighborhood Association


- He has lived in the
area for about 14 years.


- He uses the car wash
yet his issues are about broken promises.
?

The car wash promised many things and nothing was ever carried out.


- Bottom line: they can?t
be trusted.


(-) Joe Konopka -
Candidate for District Supervisor


- He is very familiar
with this area and uses the car wash yet he is not a customer on Saturday or
Sunday because the traffic situation is horrendous.


- If you build more,
more will come.
? 
Expanding the car wash
will make problems larger.


- The housing issue is
critical so spaces should be used for housing.


(-) Susan Chandler - 


- She lives on Page
Street which is 1 block away from the car wash.


- She lives in a classic
Victorian neighborhood and she doesn?t believe in increasing commercialization.



- The owners have proved
that they can not be trusted.


(-) Winston
Montgomery - Alamo Square Neighborhood Association


- This car wash is a
nuisance and this proposal will increase this nuisance.


- He read a letter from
a resident who could not attend the hearing and is opposed to the expansion.


(-) Kirk Kleinschmidt


- Since 1985 neighbors
have repeatedly complained of the car wash.


- The Commission imposed
restrictions on the car wash yet none of these restrictions were ever
implemented.


- He would like the
Commission to deny this conditional use.


- If the Commission were
to approve the conditional use, certain restrictions should be enforced and
carried out.


(-) Robin Haxo










- Her family is happy
that the car wash is doing so well, yet they should move to an area that can
support heavy commercial use. 


- This Commission did
not approve the expansion of a business just across the street.


- She never takes her
children along a very busy street and fight with cars that are either parked on
the sidewalk or coming into the car wash.


(-) Mark Toparcher -
President of the Alamo Square Neighborhood Association


- He would like the
Commission to deny the expansion of the car wash.


- This project goes
against the principals of good urban design.


(-) Patricia Vaughey


- This appeal was done
by Haight/Ashbury, Alamo Square and The Planning Association of Divisadero
Street


- As planners, they hear
it all the time -- more housing is required.


- You cannot allow
someone to expand a project if they have not followed the rules.


(-) Jerry Wilder


- He is one of the
people that run to the park and run back.
?

He has slipped because of the oil that comes onto the sidewalk.


- How many incidents
will it take for the carwash to clean their mess?


(-) Valery Hartwell -
Alamo Square Neighborhood Association


- She agrees with all of
the comments from the previous speakers--(showed pictures of her back yard and
how her trees have died because of the chemicals sprayed onto the cars.)


(-) Joe O?Donahue
 
- Residential Builders


- This meeting should be
held not to grant an expansion but to penalize a business owner which did not
follow the requirements imposed on them by the Commission.


- The car wash can
improve on their existing facilities.
?

Instead of using money to expand, they should provide better salaries to
their employees.


- There is no need for
underground parking.


(-) Jeremy Burchin


- He has lived in the
neighborhood for over 2 years.


- He opposes the
expansion of this project since he has slipped many times on the sidewalk, the
parking is really bad, there are cars parked on the sidewalk, there is an
incredible amount of noise, and there is an awful smell because of the
chemicals used at the carwash.


(-) Mark White


- He feels very strongly
about opposing this project.


- He agrees to
everything the previous speakers have said.

because they were built that way or because there were recent additions.
