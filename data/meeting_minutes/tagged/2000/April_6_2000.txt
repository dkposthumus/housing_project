General 
      Plan Map and Text Amendments for Executive Park.
 Consideration


of a proposal 
      to adopt amendments to the Subarea Plan For Executive Park maps and text 
      found within the South Bayshore Plan Element of the General Plan to facilitate 
      the development of a mixed use community proposed as a Planned Unit Development 
      on approximately 58 acres of the 70 acre Executive Park Subarea. The Executive 
      Park Subarea Plan of the South Bayshore Plan Element of the General Plan 
      encompasses Lots 24, 61, 65, 74, 75, 85, 86, and 88/90 of Assessor’s 
      Block 4991 and is generally bounded by U.S. Highway 101 to the west, Harney 
      Way to the south, Jamestown Avenue to the southeast, and Bay View Hill Park 
      to the north, near Candlestick Park in the City. The maps of the General 
      Plan that would be considered for amendment are: (1) The map entitled Figure 
      18 San Francisco Executive Park Land Use Plan found on page II.9.51 of the 
      South Bayshore Area Plan, to be amended to clarify the various land uses 
      to be developed within the subarea; (2) Figure 19 San Francisco Executive 
      Park Auto Access on page II.9.52 of the South Bayshore Area Plan and Figure 
      20 San Francisco Executive Park Auto Egresson page II.9.53 of the South 
      Bayshore Area Plan would be combined into a single Figure 19: San Francisco 
      Executive Park Auto Access map which would eliminate an extension of Executive 
      Park West through City of Brisbane jurisdiction to Harney Way and reconfigure 
      that street to remain within San Francisco jurisdiction to Harney Way; and 
      (3) Figure 21 San Francisco Executive Park: Urban Form Plan would be amended 
      to show a more simple height and bulk zones for the project in a re-numbered 
      Figure 20: San Francisco Executive Park Urban Form Plan consistent with 
      the new Figure 18. The text proposed for amendment include portions of the 
      text of the Subarea Plan For Executive Park to (a) create a new Urban Design 
      policy for the subarea and include several new urban design guidelines through 
      the various text sections of the subarea plan; (b) add text to reinforce 
      the Town Center concept for retail space and an outdoor plaza gathering 
      place for workers, residents and visitors to meet and communicate and develop 
      a sense of community; (c) seek to preserve the 26 acre open space in a natural 
      environment with the least amount of further grading to accommodate public 
      trails, yet which will provide at least one scenic vista point to view the 
      water; (d) seek to strengthen transit use by workers and residents of the 
      area; (e) seek to minimize single occupant vehicle use by area workers and 
      residents or, at a minimum, seeks to encourage joint use of parking resources 
      by sharing these facilities with workers, residents and area recreational 
      users; and (f) allow the configuration of the extension of Executive Park 
      Boulevard to remain within the jurisdiction of the City & County of 
      San Francisco rather than extend into the jurisdiction of the City of Brisbane 
      to connect to Harney Way. The Planning Commission initiated these amendments 
      on February 4, 2000 and on March 23, 2000 will consider adoption of amendments 
      for recommendation to the Board of Supervisors. For more information on 
      this subject, please contact planner Susana Montana at (415) 558-5984.

      Conditional Use Application for an Amendment to a Planned Unit Development 
      (PUD) at Executive Park
. Consideration of an extension and amendment 
      to a Planned Unit Development (PUD) to be developed on approximately 58 
      acres of land consisting of Lots 85, 86 and 88/90 (formerly Lot 87) in Assessor’s 
      Block 4991 to allow up to 1,324,000 square feet (sq.ft) of new office space, 
      52,500 sq.ft. of new retail and restaurant space, 25,000 sq.ft. of health 
      club/fitness center space, 13,200 sq.ft. of child care space, up to 521 
      new dwelling units and accessory residential off-street parking spaces, 
      off-street freight loading spaces and accessory commercial off-street parking 
      spaces. The PUD would authorize specific land uses within the Project Site 
      within which one-half of the non-residential development and one-half of 
      500 on-site housing units must commence construction within 24 months from 
      the date of the PUD authorization and, if this performance criteria is met, 
      the remaining commercial development may be allowed provided construction 
      for this phase, along with the remainder of the required 500 on-site housing 
      units, begins within 48 months of the date of the PUD authorization. All 
      construction must commence within the 48 month period, or earlier, along 
      with all associated mitigation measures, infrastructure, local employment 
      requirements, affordable housing linkage requirements for the office space, 
      and other conditions of approval. The PUD would (1) require the recordation 
      of a notice of special restriction on the deed of approximately 26 acres 
      of open space which describes the open space program to insure improvement 
      and maintenance of the open space area contiguous to Bay View Hill Park; 
      (2) require that a minimum of 500 dwelling units be constructed within the 
      55 acre site; (3) require that ten percent of all dwelling units provided 
      on-site must be affordable to households whose incomes do not exceed one 
      hundred percent of the median income for rental units and one hundred twenty 
      percent of the median income for sale units; (4) require new office development 
      to meet the housing requirements set forth in Section 313 of the Planning 
      Code; (5) specify design characteristics of the development to foster pedestrian 
      interest and sound urban design of the area as an attractive gateway to 
      the City; (6) allow a greater number of freight loading spaces than required 
      by the Planning Code, if needed to meet projected demand; (7) allow a specific 
      number of residential and non-residential parking spaces , and the potential 
      for additional off-site parking and possibly on-site parking in the event 
      necessary to avoid spill-over parking impacts to nearby neighborhoods; (8) 
      alter the previously approved configuration for the extension of Executive 
      Park Boulevard to remain within City & County of San Francisco jurisdiction 
      as it connects to Harney Way; (9) provide certain exemptions from code requirements 
      of rear yard or light and air, if necessary for housing development and 
      as determined by the Director of Planning upon review of a building permit; 
      and (10) require various other mitigation measures to eliminate or ameliorate 
      potential environmental impacts associated with the proposed development. 
      This authorization is contingent upon the approval of amendments to the 
      San Francisco Executive Park Subarea Plan of the South Bayshore Plan of 
      the General Plan adopted by the Planning Commission and recommended to the 
      San Francisco Board of Supervisors. The proposed project also requires land 
      and condominium subdivisions. The Project is in the area generally bounded 
      by Executive Park Boulevard, Harney Way, Bay View Hill Park and Jamestown 
      Avenue, and lies within a C-2 (Community Business) District and 40-X, 60-X, 
      80-X 100-G, 140-H, 165-I and 200-I Height and Bulk Districts in the South 
      Bayshore area.


 
      Recommendation: Approval. Please note that the Planning Commission approved 
      a Resolution of Intent to approve the Final Motion of Planning Department 
      staff-initiated and Planning Commission initiated amendments to the Planned 
      Unit Development Conditional Use Application submitted by the Project Sponsor.

        by keeping them vibrant and alive.

(+) Bill

        HYDE STREET
, northwest corner at Geary Street; Lot 008 in Assessor's 
        Block 0302 -- Request for Conditional Use authorization to install a wireless 
        telecommunications facility in an RC-4 (Residential-Commercial Combined) 
        District, the North of Market Residential Special Use District (Sub-Area 
        #2) and an 80-T Height and Bulk District. The proposed project is the 
        installation of two panel antennas, one on each street frontage, flush 
        mounted to the roof parapet approximately 55 feet above ground level, 
        and base station equipment in the basement of the building as part of 
        a wireless transmission network operated by Sprint Spectrum.


 
        Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with conditions.


 
        (Continued from Regular Meeting of March 9, 2000).
















 
        SPEAKER(S)               




 
(+) Anthony 
          Lowell - Sprint PCS


- Would like 
          to have commission accept their application to allow installation of 
          antennae at project site.




 
        - There is quite a need for specific sites for the installation of antennae 
        in San Francisco.


 
        - Proposal does meet Planning Code requirements.


 
        - Cellular phone technology benefits residents


 
        - There are 25 units in the proposed building.




(-) David Overdorf - SOS (Save Our Streets)


 
        - Speaks on behalf of various property owners of the area.


 
        - The neighborhood is mainly residential


 
        - Believes that Sprint would be able to provide the same kind of service 
        by installing the antennae about 3 blocks away.


 
        - He believes that vandals would be able to reach the antenna.


 
        - The Antenna would be ugly and intrusive.




 - He believes 
          that the antenna would interfere with his hearing aid and would probably 
          cause similar interferences with other health type of devices.


 




(-) 
        Georgiana Warner


 
        - Owner of 625 Hyde Street


 
        - Her concerns are with noise and the problems that might cause with her 
        tenants.


 
        - 35 ____ noise from the basement would be too much.


 
        - All her tenants are opposed.




 


(+) Michael 
          Gebretsadik


- It is critical 
          for Sprint to be on this site.




 
        - Being on an intersection allows antenna to provide signals to all 4 
        sides.


 
        - They did a drive test and determined that this site would be the most 
        appropriate since moving the location of the antenna would disrupt the 
        distance between the other proposed sites for antennas.




 - It
’s 
          possible that the technology of the future would be to have less power 
          on each antenna yet this technology would have to allow for more antenna 
          locations.


 




(+) 
        Bill Hamett


 
        - Was hired to evaluated this site with ? Guidelines.


 
        - This site does indeed meet the FCC requirements.


 
        - There were community meetings with Sprint and residents and their issues 
        were addressed.




 - The antenna 
          is high above the street and will give small transmission levels.


 




(-) 
        Robert Garcia


 
        - He believes that the project sponsor did not 


 
        - The project sponsor gave notice to many neighborhood organizations yet 
        non of these are located on or near the project site.


 
        - Save or Streets have worked hard to provide the neighborhood with appropriate 
        living areas.




 - Would like 
          to suggest that a proper list


(-) Tushar 
          Routh




 
        - He resides within 100 feet from the site.


 
        - He has cellular service and can receive transmission with no problem 
        yet there is no antenna at the proposed location.


 
        - Would not like to have his neighborhood to be the tourist attraction 
        for most antennas.


 
        - He is also concerned about his property value.




 - Would like 
          Commission to reject proposal or for the approval to have conditions 
          not allowing for any more antennas to be installed in the future, sponsor 
          to dismantle antenna.


 




(-) 
        Maureen Reen


 
        - Opposes this proposal.


 
        - She lives in the 400 block of Hyde Street


 
        - She believes these antennas transmit radiation


 
        - She knows that all the neighbors disapprove this proposal.


 
        - She will be exposed to the radiation and feels that she is already exposed 
        to pollution.




 


(-) Jay 
          Lynch




 
        - Owner of the 15-story building across the street.


 
        - Is opposed to any antennas in the area.




 


Rebuttal






(+) Anthony Lowell


 
        - Is concerned that the commission be aware of all the details involving 
        the installation of this antenna.


 
        - There is not much flexibility with choosing a proper site for antennas.


 
        - If there is a need, Spring is available to provide more evidence to 
        the Commission.


 
        - There is only so much signal that can be provided with certain amount 
        of antennas.


 
        - It is possible for calls to be made but the service is not very adequate.

    Recommendation: Approval with Conditions
















SPEAKER(S):






(+) 
      Carl Danielson - Danielson and Whitehead






- 
      Would like to thank Ms. LeBlanc for the work and efforts of the Planning 
      Staff.








(+) 
      Ali Moghaddasi - Principal Designer - HOK Architects






- 
      The site is quite small but he is working throughout the planning issues 
      with the planning   staff.






- 
      The project will provide a green house and provide beautiful landscape to 
      the area, climate control year round, indoor outdoor seating.






- 
      Would like to convert Shaw Alley to a permanent restaurant setting.






- 
      Mission Street is becoming one of the major office blocks in the city.






- 
      The main entrance of the building will be from Mission Street






- 
      The 24 feet high lobby will allow maximum visibility within the lobby.








(-) 
      Jack Smith - 545 Mission Street building owner.






- 
      He is concerned about the closing of Shaw Alley. The first time that he 
      heard of the closure of Shaw Alley was April 6.






- 
      The alley is very important to the function of his building -- dropping 
      off and picking up people, freight elevators.






- 
      The closure of the alley would be closed from 11 to 2 but the language in 
      the staff report mentions a minimum of 11 to 2 -- which means it could be 
      extended.






- 
      The procedure of closing the alley should have been attended to before the 
      presentation of the project building.






- 
      Is the closing of the alley an integrated part of the decision is it required 
      for the progress of this project.








(-) 
      Loyd Schleigel 






- 
      This project is across the street of Golden Gate University and there are 
      about 8 other office buildings which means that there is a large amount 
      of office space available.






- 
      Another office building in this area would be superfluous.








(-) 
      Sue Hestor - San Francisco for Reasonable Growth






- 
      The code language requires that we use pre-existing office space and that 
      is not the case for this project.






- 
      The planning department cannot be so sloppy in regards to proposition M.

          Assessor’s Block 3733, Lot 79 on the SE corner of 5th and Howard 
          Streets, within the South of Market neighborhood. There are two inter-connected 
          buildings on the site, a three-story building consisting of approximately 
          95,000 square feet (including basement) and a six-story building consisting 
          of approximately 213,500 square feet (including basement). Of the combined 
          approximately 308,500 square feet of space in the two buildings, about 
          114,000 square feet are presently retail, 13,000 square feet are office, 
          and 172,500 square feet are storage and vacant retail space. The proposed 
          project would consolidate all the retail space into the three-story 
          building and convert the six-story building into an office building. 
          The net result of the project would be a combined total of approximately 
          92,000 square feet of retail, 165,000 square feet of office, 12,000 
          square feet of storage space, and 20,000 square feet of parking on site. 
          The basement of the six-story building would be converted to 45 valet 
          parking spaces. The vehicular access to the parking garage would be 
          from Tehama Street. The project site is located within the C-3-S (Downtown 
          Support District) and within the 130-F Height and Bulk district. The 
          proposed project requires review by the City Planning Commission pursuant 
          to Planning Code Section 309, which regulates permit review with C-3 
          (Downtown) zoning districts and Planning Code Sections 321 and 322 which

                Demolition permit was not processed properly. The site was posted 
                for a demolition permit and the neighbors immediately filed an 
                appeal. Despite the appeal and that there was a 15 day hold, the 
                building was demolished as of this morning. This is at least the 
                2nd time that a demolition permit has not been dealt with properly.














Commissioner Mills:
 Requested that staff check on this item.






Gerald 
          Green

          Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with conditions.






 
          SPEAKER(S):




(+) Alice Barkly - 
representing project sponsor


 
          - Letters of support from neighbors were passed out to Commissioners.


 
          - The housing unit in the building is very dilapidated. The cost of 
          rehabilitating unit will exceed 50%.


 
          - Building is appropriate for live/work. It is a very small site only 
          25' wide by 104' deep.


 
          - Adjacent to a residential development on Juniper Street.


 
          - Massing has been designed to match neighbors housing. 








(+) Jim Meeko -
 Lives at 364-366 10th Street for 23 years


 
          - Has lived at this location for 23 years.


 
          - He is concerned that the project respect the industrial nature of 
          the area.


 
          - The architect
’s 
          original design would have been too tall and unfriendly so she redid 
          the design to accommodate the neighbors. She really works with all the 
          neighbors.








(+) Toby Levy
 - project architect


 
          - Tried to make the appearance as if it were a 40 foot high building 
          on the face of the street.


 
          - Balcony is set back about 10 feet.


 
          - Bays were individualized with set backs of the open space in each 
          unit.


 
          - Wanted to make it an urban scale but also trying to respect the industrial 
          nature of the buidling - proposing cement panels with stucco around 
          the windows.








(+) Fred Wilman
 - neighbor


 
          - Any improvement to the area is welcomed.








(-) Sue Hester
 - San Franciscans for a Reasonable Growth


 
          - Legal issues on this project are: 1) interim controls cannot be less 
          restrictive, they can only be more restrictive. The policy are from 
          the residence element implementation policies are policies of the city 
          and the policies of the master plan for the status of law. The Commission 
          has no ability to change the policies that are in the master plan by 
          a planning resolution. The policy in the master plan is about replacement 
          housing. 2) the categorical mention was legally inappropriate since 
          the previous speaker didn
’t 
          mention that he is the project sponsor. A project sponsor cannot do 
          a categorical exemption when there is more than one project going on 
          which includes more than 6 units. The project sponsor is Wilman Import/Export 
          and owns the 3 lots on the other side of Mr. Miko and plans to build 
          a 32 unit live/work project. The categorical exception cannot be used 
          when someone splits the project. The city policy requires the determinations 
          of infeasibility by the mayor
’s 
          office of housing. The Mayors Office of Housing has it
’s 
          responsibility to protect the supply of affordable housing.








(-) John Elbling - Executive VP of Todco


 
          - Believes that if case is approved this case, it will give the image 
          that all a property owner needs to do is let a building run down and 
          decay so that the building can be demolished and not have to replace 
          affordable housing.


 
          - There seems to be a series of arsons and no one seems to know who 
          did it that are clearing the path for both residential sites and commercial 
          sites to then be developed as live/work.


 
          - His organization is going to pursue this if Commission approves this.




Rebuttal




(+) Alice Barkley -
representing project sponsor


- 
          The project sponsor is 360-362 10th Street Associates, LLC and the manager 
          is John O
’Conner. 
          This is a 6 unit building not a 32 unit building as Ms. Hester is referring 
          to. The categorical exemption is appropriate because this is only a 
          6 unit building and exempted under SEQUA.


 
          - The Commission adopted a policy and resolution that any residential 
          development in the City required a 10% affordable requirement be included 
          in those projects.


 
          - Believes that this project is appropriate since it is in the buffer 
          zone, it is across from live/work and residential housing.




Ms. Alice Barkley:


 
          - In the past, the Commission has adopted either policies or legislation 
          to implement policies of the City
’s 
          Master Plan. 


 
          - The document that Ms. Hester was quoting from is not the master plan 
          policy section.


ACTION: 
            
Motion to Continue for 2 weeks for staff to do a further analysis 
            on the impact of Section 7 of the Residence Element.








AYES: 
          
Mills, Chinchilla, Richardson
 




NAYES: 
            
Antenore (specifically because he believes that the Mayor’s 
            Office of Housing (since they have the primary responsibility of affordable 
            housing) should be consulted on what policy role Commission should 
            play on this and how they should interpret the residence element the 
            implementation of the residence element.)

          SPEAKER(S):




(+) Bryan Chu - Executive Director of LYRIC




 
            - Initially the application requested that garage be made into office 
            space because they are growing and space has become limited as well 
            as the fact that rent for non-profits is expensive. Their after school 
            program when from 9 to 6 and in the application stated that their 
            hours of operation would be from 9 to 5. There was some concern with 
            neighbors that there would be an increase in noise in the rear yard 
            area. 


 
            - They have met with the neighbors many times and have amended the 
            application to include 22 items - one of which is: to change the garage 
            to be used as storage only. The neighbors indicated that they would 
            not oppose the amended application. There is a letter of support from 
            San Francisco Special Police and Eureka Valley Promotion Association. 
            There are letters of support from a neighborhood school and church. 
            Some City organizations as well.










(-) Rachel Heyman - neighbor




 
            - Would like to have ALL items in the amended application to be deal 
            with before this case is approved. LYRIC has never been responsible 
            for things that happen to the youth after they close. 












(+) Anne Tamar-Mattis




 
          - Read letter on behalf of gay youth.


 
          - Supports change of conditions to Conditional Use authorization.










(+) Sarah Marxer




 
          - Read letters of support from neighbors.










(neutral) Freddie Niem


 
            - Neighbor and lives at 123-127 Collingwood Street


 
            - He welcomes LYRIC
’s 
            22 items that amend their initial application.




 
          - Is still concerned with: noise, trash and blocking sidewalk.




 
            - Is optimistic that better communication with LYRIC and neighbors 
            will happen.
 












(+) Ian Fried


 
            - Volunteer for Chains Link(?) 


 
            - He believes that LYRIC is an exceptional program where youth can 
            come and express their gender in a safe environment and keep them 
            from mischief.










(+) Godfrey Morata




 
            - Read a support letter from a neighbor










(+) Regina Dick-Endrizzi


 
          - Neighbor for 4 years.


 
          - Supports amended proposal.




 
            - Residential neighborhood is a more appropriate location for the 
            youth since it would be safer for them.










(+) Lion Barnett - Eureka Valley Promotion Association




 
            - This organization at first opposed the application yet with their 
            amended items, this organization feels that the new application is 
            acceptable.










(+) Holly Anderson


 
          - Read a letter support by Mat Also, Director of the Live Oaks School.






 
          Rebuttal






(+) Ryan Chu 


 
            - He agrees that they have not been able to meet all the requirements 
            in the initial application yet he does agree that they will cooperate 
            in the 22 items of the amended application.


 
            - He can speak only for the 2 years that he has been Executive Director 
            and believes that there will be improvements made. Most importantly 
            communication with the neighbors.






























ACTION: 
            
Motion approved with conditions from Director which states that 
            all of the previous conditions apply including 2 new amendments and 
            after a 6 month period, Department Staff will come back with a status

            scope of the building.
 






(+) Robert Isackson - Village Properties - project sponsor




 
            - Would like to request a change of the condition of approval. 1) 
            Item No. 15 - the bicycle storage would not be able to provide for 
            25 bike lockers. There is a bicycle room which can provide for 24 
            residences.


 
            - He is sympathetic with the Europa Motors owner but he is an illegal 
            subtenant and during the 2 years that they have owned the building 
            they have never heard from him. The tenant is Carlos Arroyo and he 
            has no right to sublease the space. He has also been aware that he 
            is on a month to month basis and he has been aware that they were 
            going to building another building.
 








(neutral) Kate Allison - Member of the Clarion Alley Mural Project

Rebuttal


 
          (+) Dan Sullivan - representing Project Sponsor






 
          - They have redesigned the facade to provide space for the mural.

          10-foot wide by 7-foot deep deck constructed without permit at the rear

Jerry Braud - Agent for Mr. Robert Gray




 
          - Would like to have this case continued to June 1, 2000.






 
          SPEAKER(S): (DR requestor)




(+) Mark Borsick - one of the owner’s of the TIC.


 
          - Would like to have this building permit be granted.




 
            - Mr. Gray who actually built this deck has put the ownership at risk 
            for a number of years. In 1996 they required him to get a permit and 
            he never did. A notice of violation was issued in 1998 and very little 
            was done. He forgoes any right to build this deck because he has continued 
            to put everyone at risk. The new owner, Mr. Spatcia, has allowed this 
            unit to be rented to third parties. Knowing that this condition exists, 
            Mr. Spatcia has gone to put the ownership at risk. In 1993, in a transfer 
            disclosure statement, Mr. Gray mentioned that the deck was permitted, 
            which was false.


 
            - There is significant neighborhood opposition to this deck. One of 
            the neighbors, Dr. Murphy, (who is abroad at the moment). Wrote a 
            letter opposing this deck.












(+) Lillian Borsick - was a member of the home owner’s management 
            committee was well as Mr. Gray and Mr. Ryan.




 
          - Many of the neighbors have opposed and written letter regarding opposition 
          of this deck.


 
          - Would like to ask the Commission to hold Mr. Gray accountable for 
          building an illegal deck.




 
            - Should they have built their own deck without the proper documentation 
            just as Mr. Gray has done.










(-) Key Ryan - one of the managing owners of the property
.


 
          - The deck of the Borsick
’s 
          is noncompliant if the lot is split.


 
          - Mr. Gray
’s 
          deck is code compliant whether or not the lot was split.




 
            - The Borsick
’s 
            when to the board of appeals and their case was denied because they 
            didn
’t 
            get the approval of the owner association. 


 
            - The Borsick
’s 
            don
’t 
            have a legal right to go against the owner
’s 
            association.




 
          - The Borsick
’s 
          have filed law suit
’s 
          against the members of the association and have lost.




 
            - The parking issue was resolved in the arbitration.


 
            - The Borsick
’s 
            have gone against the bylaws of the association.










(neutral) Enzo Spatcia - Owner of the deck




 
            - Owner of the unit since 1996.




 
          - He wasn
’t 
          familiar with the TIC programs. 




 
            - Everything was disclosed to him. He learned about the deck that 
            had been built illegally. He wasn
’t 
            familiar with the laws in San Francisco. His concern was that the 
            deck be safe. Before he bought the unit, Mr. Gray promised that he 
            would comply with all the legal steps. He had an inspector come to 
            the property and inspect the building. He was told that the deck was 
            safe and sound yet that it would be a good idea to legalize the deck. 
            Four years later there have been a lot of problems with the association. 
            He feels that he is in the middle of the battles between the members 
            of the association. Mr. Gray has been very helpful in getting all 
            the proper paperwork regarding this deck.












(-) Jerry Brown - representing Mr. Cray




 
          - Mr. Cray will take every step to make this deck legal. 


 
          - The deck will be reinspected and reconstructed to comply with new 
          codes. 






 - They 
              have applied for a building permit.


 
(-) 
              Robert Cray - Managing owner of the Vallejo Street Association




 - There 
              are 8 owners - 10 units distributed in two buildings.












 
            - He believes that since the Borsick
’s 
            can
’t 
            get their deck, they don
’t 
            want their deck to be legalized.


 
            - When they reported the violation to the building department, DBI 
            sent an inspector and it was classified as satisfactory but suggested 
            to get the proper permits. Mr. Cray has been trying to do that since 
            1996. He would have had it, but Mr. Borsick found that Mr. Cray was 
            off by 5 or 6 inches on the set back. Mr. Borsick although he as been 
            complaining about the deck not having a permit, he has been making 
            it very difficult to get a permit also.


 
            - He has inferred that Mrs. Murphy, who is away at the moment, wrote 
            a letter opposing the deck, yet Mr. Cray hasn
’t 
            been able to authenticate the signature. There is no blockage of light 
            to the neighbor
’s 
            home. Except from a privacy wall that the neighbor had requested anyway.


 
            - Mr. Cray believes that either Mr. Borsick signed the letter or wrote 
            the letter for Mrs. Murphy.












REBUTTAL






(+) Mr. Borsick




 
            - Exhibit B - If Mr. Spatcia was concerned about legalizing and getting 
            the permits, why has he allowed third parties to live there.




 
          - Dr. Murphy did write the letter and those are her comments.




 
            - Mr. Ryan spoke about the lack of light, Mr. Borsick
’s 
            deck would make. Yet the lack of light comes from Mr. Cray
’s 
            illegal deck.


 
            - He doesn
’t 
            believe that the Commission should approve a deck that was built illegally 
            and not allow this to happen again.










REPLY




(neutral) Mr. Enzo Spatcia




 
            - The deck was inspected and the deck is safe. The problem is not 
            the deck. The problem is a particular individual who is causing problems 
            within the association.
