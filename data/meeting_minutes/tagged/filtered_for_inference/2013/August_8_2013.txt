Future Meetings/Agendas
.
  
At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.


 


Commissioner Moore:


I would like to make a comment regarding roof top mounted wireless equipment and that is not in relation to anything that we just approved on consent, but I have generally expressed my concern that I would like the Department to start developing, and this is basically my experience, other criteria, which deal with visual impacts as they all collectively impact roof scape or how we look at roofs and buildings in San Francisco and I am particularly concerned, when there are additions of massive parapets and roof screen structures that alters the expression of the building. And I would like to just kind of start it as a discussion and see the Department engage in considerations, which they believe help guide this Commission to make equitable decisions of approval or denial. 


 


Commissioner Antonini:


A couple of things, first of all thanks to Commissioner Moore who brought in an article today from the Chronicle, and it announces the good news that the Pied Piper Painting is going, Maxfield Parrish’s famous painting, is going back behind the bar at the Pied Piper Bar appropriately as of August 22
nd
 at 6 P.M., so I think that a lot of the credit has to do with the public's outcry when it was initially taken down and they said that it was going to be sold and that quickly changed to it is going to be touched up and brought back, so I think that was very good news. I have a question regarding projects on Piers 30 and 32. I believe we are supposed to be seeing the draft EIR in January and that is what I have heard.


 


Director Rahaim:


That is the current scheduling.


 


Commissioner Antonini:


Because there was an article, I think was John King article that questioned the timing of the project moving forward and I never heard that anything had been delayed as far as the EIR was concerned, and it seemed like it has been the date that I fully served that we were supposed to be considering it and so I am not sure what else he may be speaking to in the article. 


 


Director Rahaim:


I am not sure. 


 


Commissioner Antonini:


But we do have that calendared at least for now. Otherwise, the Secretary Search Subcommittee continues to meet and will meet again on the 11
th
 of September. 


 


Commissioner Sugaya:


I ran into former Commissioner Bill Lee, yesterday, and he reminded me that I promised that I would do something about the Academy of Art buses, I promised his wife, and so I thought about it and so could we get a status report on the future a memo or something?


 


Director Rahaim:


On buses in general?


 


Commissioner Sugaya:


No just, on the Academy. 


 


Commissioner Borden:


There was an article in the Business Times about the Transbay Park and now that the Boston Properties and I forget who the other... I can't remember the other project sponsor there is refusing to pay for the park and I understood in our hearings when we asked the questions about it and the maintance of the park would be under their jurisdiction and so I would like to find out what is going on, and I know there must be continuing negotiations.
  
I really do feel at the hearing it was represented that they would be taking care of that park and I am frustrated to hear that there is dispute about it now.


 


Commissioner Moore:


Buses!
  
Commissioner Sugaya’s comment triggered an ongoing frustration that particularly at this time of the year where you have rogue additional tourist buses disguised as ships or whatever they are, make it almost impossible for really using transit and I am all for tourists not driving their own cars, but there has to be a way, by which, it all works together. And I do not want to sing aloud the bus, which Commissioner Sugaya mentioned, but that bus continues if I will be traffic control officer I would have my book out literally every five minutes for parking in no parking zones. And letting the motor idle more than the required or allowed three or six minutes, and the list goes on. The latest one I saw is in front of Saint Mary's Cathedral on California, where I did not know what that bus was supposed to do there, and no bus is supposed to be there because there is no loading zone and it was just standing there, so I don't want to get into too many details because I walk that area continuously and it is absolutely out of control.

Director’s Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


Commissioners just a couple of notes to make, regarding Commissioner Moore, your comment about the guidelines, Jeff Joslin, who is the Director of Current Planning is actually taking a fresh look at all of the Department's guidelines right now and we are looking at the Residential Design Guidelines as well as guidelines for the commercial districts and so I am hoping that the roof top equipment, I will make sure that the rooftop equipment is part of that whole discussion of guidelines and I know and you and other Commissioners have raised that before. Secondly, I just wanted to remind you all about and it’s in your written Director's report today about the map of the CEQA exempt project that is now available on our website.
  
This was a result of the recent discussion that you had here, as well as, with the Board of Supervisors on the new CEQA legislation and the map is now intended to very easily, map based GIS based system, you are able to click on projects and get, and find out the exemptions that are issued in any particular week and that actually refers you and links you to the actual exemption, and so that is available on the website, right now. And we are glad to have improved that service from what it was before, which was not very user friendly, that concludes my presentation, thank you.

HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:


The Board of Historic Preservation did meet yesterday. Here to share with you a couple of items from yesterday's Commission hearing. The Port Authority provided an informational overview of the proposed development and rehabilitation of Pier 70, in Crane Cove Park. This is just, the presentation was just to bring the HPC up to speed on the status of those developments and they offered to come back periodically to give further updates on those projects as they move forward. There were two Certificates of Appropriateness of note that I wanted to share with you. One was the commission approved 5-2, a Certificate of Appropriateness for 722 Montgomery Street, these are the Belli Buildings, as you know they have been in a partial state of demolition for almost a quarter of a century. Prior to the vote by the Commission, there was a good deal of discussion about a rear brick wall on Hotaling Place where the brick had been removed as part of a previous Certificate of Appropriateness. The intent of the project was always to reinstall that brick, but through bankruptcy proceedings, the storage facility that was holding on to the brick either lost the brick or sold the brick to another party. And so there were some disputes about the location of this brick and finally the Commission decided just to vote on it and move on to get this building back into working order. So the Commission did approve the project per the staff's recommendations 5-2. The other item was a Certificate of Appropriateness for 320 Judah Street, as you know this is the Doelger Sales Office building that was recently designated as part of the Department and the HPC’s Landmark Designation Work Program. The new owners, are committed to a full restoration to the building and we have already issued a few administrative level Certificates of Appropriateness, but during that work it was discovered there is extensive termite and water damage and so they have to greatly expand the work, the Commission over all was pleased with the direction the work was going and project sponsor is committed to working with the staff to make sure that the building is restored back to its 1940s period of significance. Finally, the HPC adjourned in memory of Alice Carey and there were a number of folks from the public that spoke about Alice's contributions to historic preservation, planning, architecture and her mentorship, Commissioner Sugaya was also there and expressed some kind of remarks for Alice, as you know, Alice Carey was also a former member of the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board and also served as Board President.
