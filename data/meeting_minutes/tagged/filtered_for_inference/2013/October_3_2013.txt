Just wanted to remind you of the Eastern Neighborhood Forum that Supervisor Cohen is sponsoring, we had the first meeting of the two of these last night, in Potrero Hill. I attended along with several staff member, kind of an Eastern Neighborhoods 1 o 1, if you will.
  
We had about 50 people attend, and it was a great meeting, great discussion. And the second forum will be this Saturday the 5th from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., at the California College of the Arts.

Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission


 


LAND USE COMMITTEE:
  


·
         
On Monday the Land Use Committee held a hearing on filling the Geary Blvd underpass at Fillmore Street. 
 
This hearing was requested by Supervisor Breed. The potential redesign of Geary surfaced through the Geary BRT project. The Supervisor asked for representatives of multiple agencies to discuss issues, opportunities, and ways to advance the dialogue. The hearing was staffed by Citywide Policy staff, including Acting Director Josh Switzky, the SFMTA, and the SFCTA. Planning staff opened with a brief history of Western Addition Redevelopment; including how the Geary expressway and Fillmore underpass came to be; the existing conditions; challenges to pedestrian safety; community cohesion; and the related recommendations of the JCHESS. Planning staff reviewed the City’s experiences in revisiting mid-20th century infrastructure, such as the replacement of the Central Freeway with Octavia Boulevard. Staff from MTA and the TA then discussed the Geary BRT project.
  
In fact, the concept for filling the underpass and creating a more elegant and pedestrian-friendly surface street in support of BRT is one of the options being analyzed in the BRT EIR. 


 


Staff noted the sizable financial cost that this one sub-project would add to the overall BRT project and the challenges that this creates for implementing the BRT project in the near term. Staff from all agencies, and the Supervisor, also acknowledged that substantial additional design work and community discussion would need to be done to further refine an underpass-fill option.
 The Supervisor concluded the hearing by stating an interest in having the agencies work together, perhaps with Planning in the lead, to develop a scope of work for a community process to advance this specific issue.
  
Planning staff will work together with our agency partners to develop this scope and determine the resources it would require.
        


FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: 


Appeal of 435 Potrero.
  
The appellant filed appeals of both the Class 1 cat. ex and the CU.
  
They did not have enough signatures for an appeal of the CU, so the only issue before the Board was the Class 1 CEQA exemption.
  
The appellant’s arguments were twofold: 1) that the Internet Service Exchange should not have been deemed an existing use because the former tenant had vacated the site, and 2) that the diesel generator on the site was creating pollution which should have been evaluated and mitigated.
  
The Department contended that it had determined that the use was an existing one.
  
If it was not pre-existing then it would not have been eligible for legitimization under the Eastern Neighborhoods. For this reason a Class 1 exemption, for minor alteration to existing facilities was appropriate.
  
With regard to the generator, since it was an existing part of the building it was part of the baseline for CEQA.
  
Therefore the impacts of the existing generator were not changes to the environment.
  
Furthermore, the new tenant will be required to get permits from Air Quality District.
  
The Air Quality District’s regulations will address potential impacts.
  
Supervisors Campos and Cohen asked questions, and Supervisor Cohen indicated that the sponsor had agreed to provide further filtration on the generator.
  
With that, the Board voted 11-0 to uphold the Department’s Catex.

CEQA Appeal Rights under Chapter 31 of the San Francisco Administrative Code
: If the Commission’s action on a project constitutes the Approval Action for that project (as defined in S.F. Administrative Code Chapter 31, as amended, Board of Supervisors Ordinance Number 161-13), then the CEQA determination prepared in support of that Approval Action is thereafter subject to appeal within the time frame specified in S.F. Administrative Code Section 31.16.  This appeal is separate from and in addition to an appeal of an action on a project.  Typically, an appeal must be filed within 30 calendar days of the
 
Approval Action for a project that has received an exemption or negative declaration pursuant to CEQA.  For information on filing an appeal under Chapter 31, contact the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors at City Hall, 1 Dr. Carlton B. Goodlett Place, Room 244, San Francisco, CA 94102, or call (415) 554-5184.  If the Department’s Environmental Review Officer has deemed a project to be exempt from further environmental review, an exemption determination has been prepared and can be obtained on-line at 
http://www.sf-planning.org/index.aspx?page=3447
. Under CEQA, in a later court challenge, a litigant may be limited to raising only those issues previously raised at a hearing on the project or in written correspondence delivered to the Board of Supervisors, Planning Commission, Planning Department or other City board, commission or department at, or prior to, such hearing, or as part of the appeal hearing process on the CEQA decision.
