Future Meetings/Agendas
.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.


 


Commissioner Moore:


I read a very, consequential article in the paper, where Rio Powell who designed a teeny tiny tree house in Golden Gate Park. I know the Planning Department was not involved. It was such an incredibly cute article that I'm going to pass it around. Here was a child who discovered like a hollow on the bottom of a tree and had his father who is apparently a shipbuilder or something to that extent build him a door, that is a working door, with hinges and a knob and with all of those kinds of things and installed it because there are obviously people living in the bottom of the tree. So, I want to pass this around. It's just absolutely adorable. 


 


Commissioner Antonini
: 


I want to just mention that I was in attendance at a meeting last night at Temple Baptist Church. I want to mention that the MTA, staffed by Peter Albert, it was a very good meeting it was for the residents of Lakeside Village, which is where I reside and it was a discussion of future planning for the M-Line, which runs through Lakeside and then runs along 19
th
 Avenue with significant stops at Stonestown and San Francisco State and eventually circles back to the Balboa Park Station. They have some very interesting ideas about great change, which would allow the Line to go underneath 19th Avenue and also some stations that might allow pedestrians to travel underneath 19
th
 without having to…utilizing the station to get from one side to the other, which is a great idea because it a very dangerous area. There are a lot of incidents every year with accidents involving pedestrians and by getting the Muni and pedestrians, many of them, off the surface area of the street, it's going to calm the whole situation greatly there. Anyway, it has a long way to go. It was a very good meeting and had over a hundred people in attendance and many of them spoke on their feelings in regards to it. 


 


Commissioner Borden
:


I wanted to make the rest of the Commission aware that myself along with Director Rahaim, members of the Board of Supervisors  and a bunch of different agencies are on the Mayor's 2030 Transportation Task force and we’ve had two meeting so far,  they are hoping to come up with recommendations by October, around, how we can make our transportation structure world class and what's great and unique is all the different agencies including planning and development, the Planning Department and looking at things like long range planning and development concerns as well as existing infrastructure. You can find information about this task force and its meetings on the Planning Department website which is a great, I think, appropriate place to have that information since so many people regularly visit that website. If you are interested, you can find all of the agendas and presentations related to the task force on that website. If you have questions or things that you want me to bring up, please let me know.


 


C.         DIRECTOR’S REPORT


 


4.         Director’s Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


Just two things. There was a question last week about the nature of the approval of the new Japantown Plan. I can't remember the full name of this plan and what type of approval action might be needed. We are looking…it partially depends on the nature of the final document. We are looking, the short answer is…it's up to us, up to the Commission if they want to incorporate it into General Plan the way other Plans have been done.  Adopted it as Commission Policy or adopt it in another form. It is somewhat variable depending on how the Commission chooses to go.  We also have to decide what type of environmental review might be needed depending on the specifics of that Plan. It’s pretty clear that it may not require an Environmental Impact Report. But whether it requires a Neg Dec or a Categorical Exemption, we don't know yet at this point. So, as we get into more details of that Plan we'll get back to you on that as well. The other thing I wanted to mention is that I will be at the Annual Planning Conference this year which is in Chicago. I will be leaving tomorrow and be out of the office until next Thursday and Jose Campos will be in charge of the Department in my absence. The conference, this year, is in Chicago where the APA’s office is located. And so, they are extending a day, a day longer than normal.  The conference runs from Saturday to Wednesday this year. And that concludes my report. 


 


5.         Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.


 


LAND USE COMMITTEE: 


 




Supervisor Wiener’s Ord. Amending Local CEQA Procedures.  
This Commission consider the proposal on March 14 and the HPC considered it on March 20.  Both Commissions recommended approval with two modifications: 1) increase the appeal window to 30 days and 2) provide increased clarity for the process where the Board acts as the CEQA decision-making body.  Prior to the Land Use hearing, Supervisor Wiener made 6 amendments, including responding to these Commissions requests.  Prior to the LU hearing, he made the following amendments:
 




1.
             
clarifications  to the definition of “approval action”


2.
             
requiring written notice for exemptions in districts with both an “adopted” and “officially recognized” survey.


3.
             
Limit the filing of a notice of exemption until after the period for appeal to the Board has expired.


4.
             
When the Board is the CEQA decision-making body, and CEQA appeals are raised at hearing, the Board shall provide the Planning Department with opportunity to submit a written response prior to the close of the public hearing.


5.
             
Extending the window for appeal to 30 days for all documents.


6.
             
Clarifying that when the Board directs planning to revise an EIR, the revised portions that may be re-reviewed include any new info added to the EIR.


At the hearing, the public raised many of the same concerns raised that were raised to this Commission.  Public comment was lengthy and divided folks from neigh. Orgs, enviro groups, and labor with some from each camp in favor and some opposed to the proposal.  There did seem to be consensus that rules for appeals of Neg. Decs and Exemptions should be codified.  Both Supervisor Kim and Board President Chiu were interested in increasing notification.  Our Director committed to provided increase online notification that would be searchable by time and geography.  Supervisor Kim expressed concerns that noticing may be reduced under the proposal and interest in allow appeals until the last approval—which is essentially the situation at we have currently. Supervisor Kim announced that she planned to introduce an alternative proposal the next day, on Tuesday. 
  After four hours of hearing on this matter, the Committee voted to continue the item for two weeks until April 22.




BF 121065: Polk Street Tobacco and Alcohol Controls.  
The Planning Commission passed Resolution 18823 recommending approval with modifications at the March 14th hearing.
 
The revised legislation reflects some (not all) of the recommendations of the Planning Commission:
 




1.         You recommended removing the Tobacco Paraphernalia restriction from the Polk Street NCD – recommendation was not incorporated.


2.         PC sought to modify several controls within the proposed Lower Polk Alcohol RUD, most of which were included in the revised ordinance. However, the major recommendation that the ban on new bars and liquor stores be modified was not changed.  


This commission had recommended these three changes instead of a ban :


a.
             
Prohibit new bars and liquor stores uses when located on a parcel within 100’ of a parcel on which an existing bar or liquor store is located; No proximity controls were included in the revised Ordinance.


b.
            
New bar and liquor store uses may be permitted with Conditional Use authorization from the Planning Commission unless they are located on a parcel within 100’ of a parcel with an existing bar or liquor store; 


c.
             
Require that new Restaurants with Type 47 ABC licenses obtain Conditional Use authorization.


The following recommendations of the PC were incorporated:


a.
             
Remove the requirement that Restaurants with Type 47 or 49 liquor licenses close by midnight.


b.
            
Require that restaurants continue food service until closing.


c.
             
Modify the proposed abandonment period for existing liquor establishments such that liquor establishments are considered an abandoned use if the use has been discontinued 3 years or more; The abandonment period was increased to but only to 1 year.


d.
            
Add a sunset provision for the proposed Lower Polk Alcohol Restricted Use District so that the provisions of the district would expire after three years.  The amended legislation includes a 5 year sunset provision.


Lastly you requested that the ordinance add an emphasis on enforcement of existing problem operators. This was not included in the revised legislation.


 




 




FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: 




This week the Land Use Committee considered a portion of Supervisor Chiu’s NE Ordinance, which dealt with the expansion of the TDR program and allows TDRs to be transferred to and from any C3 District.  
The Commission voted on this portion of Supervisor Chiu’s NE Legislation on May 17, 2012 as Phase 3 and did not recommend any modifications to the TDR portion of the Ordinance.  The Board passed this ordinance on first reading this week.
 




 


·
         
CAT EX appeal at 611 Buena Vista West Avenue. 
 The appeal was filed by Susan Brandt-Hawley on behalf of the Buena Vista Historic Preservation Association.  The project is to construct a third story vertical addition to an existing two-story, single-family residence. The appellant has the following three main concerns:  


1.
     
The proposed project has a significant impact to historic resources;


2.
     
The proposed project has a significant impact to public views; and


3.
     
The DR Action Memo is inconsistent with the Planning Commission’s intent with regards to the required front setback.  


 


During the Discretionary Review hearing on September 6, 2012, the Planning Commission requested for an additional THREE feet (for a total of FIVE feet) setback from the front building wall.  This condition was crafted to allow greater visibility of the corner turret of the adjacent building to the south at 601 Buena Vista West.  The appellant argued that the condition made was a mitigation to offset the visual impact to the adjacent historic resource at 601 Buena Vista West. If this were a mitigation to avoid a significant impact, the project cannot be exempt from environmental review.  


 


At the Board hearing, Staff clarified the condition made by the Commission was to address a design concern and increase street visibility of a building feature on the adjacent property.  As such, this change was simply a condition of approval for the building permit and NOT a CEQA mitigation to address any impacts to the environment.  Given the project complies with CEQA Guidelines and there is no evidence of any significant impact to the environment, mitigation measures are NOT required.  


 


Furthermore, Planning Staff reminded the Board that the overall height of the subject building (with the new addition) would remain shorter than, the neighboring buildings.  Further, buildings on Buena Vista West Avenue are not designated as a scenic vista nor are they considered a scenic public setting.  Importantly, views from Buena Vista Park, including ocean views, would not be blocked by the proposed project addition.


 


Concerns related to the Planning Commission’s approved motion and intent are not a CEQA impact and do not substantiate nullifying the original issuance of the Categorical Exemption for the project.  A hearing before the Board of Appeals, the more appropriate body to address concerns about the building permit, is already set for May 8th.  


 


While Supervisor Scott Wiener had many questions for the Appellant and Planning Staff, he ultimately agreed with the decision and analysis of the Planning Department.  The Board voted unanimously to uphold the Categorical Exemption Determination.


 




Items that were adopted this week on Final Read include

:




Market Street Masonry Historic District.
 


Deleting the Sunset Provision of the Excelsior Alcohol Restricted Use District

BOARD OF APPEALS: 


(Anmarie Rodgers for Scott Sanchez, Zoning Administrator)


The Board met last night and considered one item that may be of interest to the Planning Commission - the appeal of a building permit application to allow a new 4-story building containing two commercial floors and one dwelling unit at 721 Beach Street.  The subject property is located within the C-2 (Community Business) Zoning District and the Planning Commission heard a Mandatory DR for this project in March 2012, at which time the Planning Commission unanimously approved this project.  Last night the Board unanimously upheld the Planning Commission's decision.

 •         Sacramento Street. The Land Use Committee considered an ordinance sponsored by Supervisor Farrell that would allow a very limited change to the Sacramento Street NCD.  This ordinance would permit a change of use from Business or Prefessional Services use to Medical service use provided that no active use or residential space is lost.  You recommended approval with two minor technical amendments on February 21 of this year. This week Supervisor Farrell amended the Ordinance per your recommendations and the Committee recommended approval of the revised Ordinance.


•           The Committee also recommended approval of a landmark designation for 320 Judah Street also known as the Doelger Sales Building.  The HPC recommended landmarking this building on October 3, 2013. Supervisor Wiener signed on as the legislative sponsor.
