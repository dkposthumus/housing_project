Commissioner Moore
: 


I read an article yesterday about reporting congestions on 20 cities in North America, San Francisco, among the 20 cities ranked as the 11th most congested city, which was led by Los Angeles, followed by Vancouver, Canada, and some other cities somewhere -- Seattle, Toronto, New Orleans, San Jose , Montreal and Chicago. Chicago is much less congested than we are. While we are a transit-first policy, we are still struggling with congestion, which is very, very similar to what other people experience as to not getting to work on time, break down of emergency services, and so on. I think it's a well-presented point, which we should keep in mind moving forward relative to discussions on parking and discussions on transit and transit improvements, etcetera. I'll pass this article around so people can see the methodology.


Commissioner Wu:


I want to thank my fellow Commissioners for their vote of confidence. Looking forward to the work we have ahead.


Comissioner Antonini: 


I introduced to the Commission last week, a plan by Captain Tangherlini, and it's a 

        matter of public record. I don't know how much of the public has had a chance to look at it. It shows a lot of promise. On my 11 years on the Planning Commission it's been very gratifying that we have passed a lot of measures that have provided a lot of housing and provided a lot of commercial space and a lot of other good things but the problems with a lot of individuals who are in need still remains. And all you have to do is go outside and walk on any part of the City and see people who are obviously not capable of taking care of themselves and, you know, we have not been able to deal with this problem. So I think anybody who has a plan, that shows merit, and apparently it has worked in other cities and has worked for a while, here, we do pass a lot of supportive housing, but if we can't get individuals into support housing, the housing does not solve the problem and these are instances where more than just housing is needed, care for psychiatric problems, addictions, substance problems, which are really needed. So I would ask that we do ask staff, with your consent, we calendar something in the future to hear more about this, perhaps invite people such as Bevan Dufty who is the Mayor's point person on this issue and others to participate, and while there are other forums where this should also be discussed, I think since we deal so much with issues involving housing and where people are going to be living, that would include people who are living in the streets and on parks. I would like to ask for your help in that matter.


Commissioner Borden
:


I want to recognize Harold Brooks, Bay Area Chapter in San Francisco. Today marks the end of his tenure as a CEO. He's been elevated as Senior Vice President for international services for the American Red Cross and will be moving to Washington. But he has been a tremendous champion. I don't know if people know but the American Red Cross Bay Area Chapter is the most generous, better than New York City and greater than Los Angeles, always stepping up, whether it's Hurricane Sandy or any disaster around the country in addition to stepping up significantly locally. We also have the most volunteers, even in Hurricane Sandy we had almost 200 volunteers from the Bay Area that lived in New York to make things happen. We're lucky, because we have very skilled staffs, who know how to manage things. The operation on the ground in New York was largely managed by Gregory Smith out of the Bay Area Chapter he was there 30 days working on that. I wanted to recognize him and what he's done for the American Red Cross. They bought the building on Market Street, and they'll be moving in, in a couple of months and are excited to help revitalize the neighborhood and do an adaptive reuse of a great older building. I wanted to recognize him for his great work and make sure everyone knows the work happening with the Red Cross.


Commissioner Antonini
: 


I met with a group of people who I think are quite knowledgeable on this subject yesterday and the subject regarding illegal in-law units which are present throughout the City and one of the groups in a specific area in the City indicated it was his feeling that up to 80% of the units that had 

        illegal -- or housing individual housing units that had an illegal unit in it. And I think this is an issue that we have to confront eventually because it's got a lot of effects on the entire housing stock. And one of them that comes to mind for me is the fact that when there are two units in a building it raises the price of the building significantly and you really have prices based upon two units, not on one. And it might explain why, when I was first out of dental school and starting to practice, places in modest homes in the Sunset and Richmond Districts were around $40,000. The increases in the priciest areas are 10 times what they were in those days, 10 to maybe 12 times. In places like the Sunset and parts of the Richmond, they're 20 times. These houses are selling for $800,000. So, I'm not saying the total cause of this is secondary units, but it does detract from the affordability of units, and I think it's something that's out there. I'm not sure whether the solution is to figure out some sort of legalization, or whether it's elimination, or what we should do, but this group seems quite interested in exploring it so I wanted to throw that out there as something that, I don't need to schedule a hearing on it, but it's something I think we should be cognizant of and look at the events that occur even though they're not units that are a part of the -- they're not on record, but they are there.


President Fong
:  


I wanted to update the Commission on the Permit Tracking System that's being worked on, a new program that the Department is starting to implement. Starting in February, there will be monthly updates and reports given by Director Rahaim. It will fuse the Planning Department as well as the Building Department. They have asked and called for a very small citizen’s advisory group, of which I volunteered to sit on that committee for a couple of meetings essentially, to sort of get a preview, maybe sort of test it, if you will. We will have trainings and more outreach in the coming weeks of spring and summer of this year with a fall rollout for implementation. So we will have updates as time goes on.

C.         
DIRECTOR’S REPORT


 


5.
     
Director’s Announcements


Director Rahaim
:


Let me add my congratulations to President Fong and Vice President Wu. The beginning of the year is a good time to look back and look ahead. If I could refer to my written director's report there were a couple of items to bring to your attention that I think are interesting to look at how the Department and the Commissions are doing right now. First is that you have now adopted and the Board has adopted nine neighborhood plans and we have two more on the way. And those plans only cover about 20% of the total area of the City, but cover about 80% of what is being built in the City. We now have plans in place that will cover a vast majority of the City where building is happening. If you compare the kind of projects that come to you and the types of controversies that come to you and to the Department, it is pretty striking that the projects within the plan areas tend to be less controversial than the projects outside of the plan areas that are requiring -- asking for some kind of change in zoning or change in procedure. So I would argue that the intent of the plans is working, that the plans are doing exactly what they intended to do. The other reason that I believe that is because within the plan areas we have not had to do one full EIR for any single project. It's always been community plan exemptions or other type of lesser environmental review, which saves time and money and means those projects are generally consistent with the plans, which is what the intent was all along. So I feel pretty good about that. As I say in the report, we are also more involved now in a broader range of implementation of those plans. Secondly, looking ahead at the year, I do think we are -- it is unlikely that we will take on a major new neighborhood planning effort of that same type in the coming couple of years. Rather, I think -- as I point out, we are looking at an unusually large number of publicly owned sites that are in play, the Port, Housing, UCSF, Laurel Heights property on the market. So it's incumbent on us to look at those sites -- if those sites play out as intended by the owners today there could be 10 million square feet of development on those sites. It's a huge site of development. Those will consume a lot of our time over the next couple of years, on the environmental and entitlement side and urban design issues, and its incumbent on us to look at the policy implications putting those public sites in play for development. Secondly, the second piece of the work that I think is interesting, is the work in the neighborhood commercial districts, partially related to the Mayor's investment in neighborhood strategy which is looking at not necessarily up-zoning those districts, but looking at how we invest in those districts, support businesses, and encourage investment where it can happen. So that is also, to me, a very interesting part of our upcoming work plan. There's a lot of work on our plate. Our revenues as you will hear are way up, and we are looking at how to kind of catch up with the workload because we are seeing substantial increases in development applications. But I just wanted to give you a flavor of where we were, where we're heading over the next year or two, and also ask for your input on the kind of things we should be doing, and I'm happy to have a broader discussion or even hearing on that topic in the coming weeks. 


            


6.         Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.




LAND USE COMMITTEE: 


The Land Use Committee held a hearing on the Interagency Plan Implementation Committee Annual Progress Report.  This hearing is required by both the San Francisco Administrative Code Article 36 and the Development Impact Fee Report pursuant to the San Francisco Planning Code Section 409.  In November (?) staff presented this information to the Commission.  This week the Board received the same presentation.  This presentation allows the City to begin making funding allocations for area plan infrastructure needs. (True?)  This hearing was informational only.


FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: 




·
                     
This week the BOS unanimously approved the landmark designations of the Twin Peaks Tavern in the Castro neighborhood and Sam Jordan’s Bar in the Bayview neighborhood.  These are the first designations since 2010.  


·
                     
Sam Jordan’s Bar i
s significant due to its association with the late Sam Jordan, a prominent African American community leader, Golden Gloves champion, pioneering African American business owner along the Third Street corridor in the Bayview District, and the first African American candidate for Mayor of San Francisco (1963). In 1959, Mr. Jordan opened Sam Jordan’s Bar in a c.1880’s building that was originally constructed adjacent to the corrals, slaughterhouses, and tanneries associated with “Butchertown.” The bar is still in operation and is one of the oldest continuously operating African American businesses along the Third Street corridor. Sam Jordan’s Bar was known as an organizing space and catalyst for community-based initiatives and was part of network of African American bars and restaurants that served dual roles as neighborhood-serving charitable and social organizations.


·
                     
The Twin Peaks Tavern
 located at 401 Castro Street is associated with LGBT history. It is known as the first gay bar in San Francisco (opened in 1972) to feature large expanses of glass, which revealed rather than obscured the view of bar patrons. Housed in a remodeled turn-of-the-century building in the heart of the Castro, the bar retains its expansive windows and continues to serve the LGBT community.


·
                     
Appeal of the subdivision map for 1 Capitol Avenue.  
 This project was before the Planning Commission in 2010 as a rezoning from P to RH-1, a PUD, and a Conditional Use authorization to build 28 single-family houses on previously surplus public lands.  Since the Commission heard the project a new owner, Habitat for Humanity bought the entitlements. Habitat retained the features of the entitlements except for a slight reduction in the building footprint and instead of providing 15% inclusionary housing, Habitat would provide 100% affordable, homeownership, family-sized housing.  The appellant raised concerns regarding the change and ownership and the location of the retaining walls.  Staff explained that ownership had no bearing on the subdivision and that the retaining walls were relevant to the building permit and not the subdivision.  Supervisor Cohen asked Habitat if there were any common areas the appellant could access for gardening.  The District Supervisor, Supervisor Avalos, stated he had mediated a meeting and Habitat had offered to build raised beds on the appellant property but that the offer had been refused.  
With that the public hearing was closed and the Board voted unanimously to uphold the subdivision and deny the appeal. 
 


·
                     
The Board voted to approve on final reading an Ordinance introduced by Supervisor Campos that would allow Personal Service uses on the 3rd floor in the Valencia Street NCD. 
 The Planning Commission considered this legislation last week at their November 29th hearing.  




 


 


INTRODUCTIONS:




·
                     
BF 130042 Farrell. Medical Service in the Sacramento Neighborhood Commercial District. 
This would permit a change of use from a business or professional service use to medical service use on the first floor or below in the Sacramento Neighborhood Commercial District.


·
                     
BF 130041 Avalos.
  
Conversion, Demolition, Merger, and Conformity of Residential Uses
. This ordinance would revise the criteria for the residential demolition, conversion, and merger.  It would standardize definitions of residential demolition, conversion, and merger across various use districts.  It would permit the enlargement or alteration of dwelling units which are nonconforming as to density in districts where dwelling units are principally permitted if there is no increase in nonconformity of height, bulk, or required rear yards or setbacks.  It would permit alterations to nonconforming uses or noncomplying structures to comply with disabled access requirements or to provide secure bicycle parking. And lastly, it would establish a strong presumption in favor of preserving dwelling units in enforcement of requirements for nonconforming uses, structures, and lots.




 


BOARD OF APPEALS: 


The Board did hold their election of officers and selected Commissioner Chris Hwang as President and Commissioner Ann Lazarus as Vice-President.


 


HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:


There were two items that were on their calendar, that I think are noteworthy to share with you. One was the review and approval of an interpretive display for the site occupied by the Roache Building at the intersection of Mission and 15th Street. The building was demolished to make way for 181 off-street parking spaces. The project was reviewed and cleared through CEQA in 2000 by this Commission and one of the mitigation measures outlined in the final environmental impact report was the creation of an interpretive display that was publicly accessible, that outlined not only the history of the Roache Building, which was an important lithography and printing business in the City, but the building functioned as a social hall for the German-American Community. It was meant to cover all of the history of the building and be located adjacent to a public right-of-way. The Historic Preservation Commission reviewed the content and found it to be adequate however the design, which includes a series of printed ceramic tiles, felt was disruptive to the content on the interpretive display. While they did approve the content and the location, they did ask the project sponsor to continue working with the Planning Department on either a suitable material to properly display the information, or to redesign the interpretive display to better follow the ceramic tiles that are being proposed as the mounting mechanism for the display. The second item, the Commission provided a recommendation on a Mills Act contract for 201 Buchanan. This is the Nightingale House on Buchanan Street near Waller, constructed in 1882 this is the first Mill's Act contract to be heard by the Commission and the Board of Supervisors since Supervisor Wiener sponsored it for property owners to take advantage of the property tax savings. The Commission commended the new property owners to their commitment to fully restore the Nightingale House. Much of the property tax savings will go into the full restoration of the property. The Commission did unanimously approve the project and offered a positive recommendation to the Board of Supervisors, with a couple of caveats or conditions to continue working with staff on a few minor details of the contract, mainly the phasing of the restoration to make sure that staff has the most updated information about when work will occur, and when staff needs to go out there to review the completion of that work, according to the state mandated requirements of the program

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND ECO-DISTRICTS
 - 
Informational Presentation
 - 
The Planning Department’s Sustainable Development Program is responsible for balancing San Francisco’s plans for future growth within the context of state and city environmental requirements. A primary goal of the Sustainable Development Program is to facilitate the implementation of sustainable infrastructure systems by coordinating development and public realm and public infrastructure improvements through community engagement. The Sustainable Development Program works to achieve compliance with the existing environmental legislation efficiently and cost effectively, it aims to improve coherence and cost-effectiveness of different policy measures, and it aims to enhance public private partnerships. Eco-Districts have emerged as an important tool of the Sustainable Development Program. This informational presentation will introduce Eco-Districts and describe the Planning Department’s ‘next steps’ as it embarks on this new endeavor.
