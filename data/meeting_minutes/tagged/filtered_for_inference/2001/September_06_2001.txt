- The redevelopment plan will work with the Bay View community and the Planning Department to build economic development projects; will work on the creation of affordable and market-rate housing; and will assist with programs to enhance the livability of Bay View Hunters Point.
Dan Dodt
- The concept plan is based on direct community involvement.
- The PAC meets once a month as a full body and is organized with 5 officers and 5 standing committees.  There are 4 issue committees and an executive committee.  The issues committees include housing, land use planning and transportation; health and environment; education, training, and employment; and economic development.
- Three specific goals have been articulated:  1) future revitalization must be guided by and benefit local residents; 2) its character and spirit must be preserved; 3) the physical and ecological environment will be improved.
- The first goal is job creation.  The second goal is to improve education, training and employment opportunities for the residents. The third goal is to focus on coordinated investment in high priority areas.  The fourth goal is to encourage civic participation through an interactive public process and foster cultural development.  The fifth goal is to preserve existing housing as well as increase housing.  The sixth goal is to improve the environmental problems and issues.  The seventh goal is to improve the physical and transportation issues. 
- They are currently in the process of outreach to receive comments and information from the community.

- The Bay View Hunter's Point PAC has not approved the Home Depot as presently proposed.
- They have invited the Bernal group in the established PAC review process and with their existing outreach process.
(+) Did not state name.

JOB HOUSING LINKAGE ORDINANCE - The Jobs Housing Linkage Program, Section 313 of the City Planning Code, was enacted by the Board of Supervisors in February 2001.  The current proposal is an ordinance amending Section 313.5 to change the formula used in the Jobs Housing Linkage Program to determine the number of affordable housing units a housing developer is required to build if an office developer elects to comply with the Jobs Housing Linkage Program Ordinance by payment of money or land to a housing developer.  
                    Preliminary Recommendation: Approval
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Calvin Welsh – Representing Council Community Organizations
- He forwarded to the Commission a document called Attachment C which has a breakdown of the workforce housing demand by land use, office, research and development, medical, cultural, institutional, retail and hotel.  The Jobs Housing Linkage program used to only be involved with hotel, retail, research and development and office.
- Office produces the most jobs for the lowest income workforce.

888 HOWARD STREET - HOTEL AND RESIDENTIAL PROJECT - Public Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR).  The proposed project would be the construction of a 39-story hotel and residential building of approximately 561,000 sq. ft. with two levels of below-grade parking on the northeast corner of Fifth and Howard Streets (Assessor's Block 3724, Lot 66).  The 37,860 sq. ft. site contains an existing surface parking lot with landscaping which is used by the adjacent Wells Fargo Data Center.  The hotel portion of the proposed project would contain about 500 rooms along with ancillary support uses such as meeting rooms, restaurants, and retail space.  Above the hotel there would be 60 to 70 residential condominiums. The hotel entryway would be on Howard St. while a separate residential entrance would be from Fifth Street.  There are two loading docks planned with entrances from Howard Street.  The site is located in the South of Market area within the C-3-S (Downtown Commercial Support) District and the 160-F Height and Bulk District.
Preliminary Recommendation:  No Action Required.
Note:  Written comments will be accepted at the Planning Department's offices until the close of business on September 18, 2001.
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Quentin Makee – South of Market Anti Displacement Coalition
- It is hard to imagine that on Page 94 of the report, there is the assumption that there is no negative impact as far as long term growth or the encouragement of growth.  There is a level of growth that is not acknowledged in the draft EIR and how it affects local businesses in this surrounding area as well as the low income community on 6th Street.
- Another thing that needs to be addressed is the mitigation of $50,000 to the Department of Parking and Traffic for 7 intersections that have been graded  F. 
- Without comprehensive planning, the EIR is missing some of the impacts it can have on local businesses and the local community.
(-) Jenny Batallones – South of Market Community Action Network.
- The draft EIR does not address the affects this hotel will have on the surrounding neighborhood.
- She is concerned about the impact this project will have on the low income, people of color, and the Philippino community.
- She urges the Commission to address the community issues.
(-) Patrice Johnson – South of Market Child Care
- A project of this magnitude will have an affect on this community.
- A more thorough investigation of this proposal needs to be made.
- This project should be compared to other projects that would have less of an impact.
- More information is needed.
(-) Richard Marquez – 6th Street Agenda
- They are a low income, SRO organizing advocacy project.
- Everything seems to be blamed on the residents on 6th Street.
- The impact on the neighborhood has not even been examined.
- A planned, community-based, comprehensive planning needs to be established here instead of a parcel-by-parcel planning.
(-) Ron Grosshart – 6th Street Agenda
- This project will affect the traffic in this area.
- The project does not even address the problems with traffic.
- The height of this project is just too large for the area.
- The EIR should address these issues.

See Case 2000.272CX below.
Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Jim Reuben – Reuben and Alter
- He has been working with PRADA and the design team for over a year.
- This is the first time he has come to the Commission and staff has given a preliminary recommendation of disapproval.
- This project should and could be approved.
- The project sponsor has raised the base since the draft EIR was issued.  The base has been raised by 1 Â½ feet to total 9 Â½ feel at the corner of Post and Grant and about 10 Â½ feet at the store entrances--this alters the perspective of the stores from the street.
- The metallic finish is not shiny or reflective.  This finish will change colors throughout the day with the change and the angle of sunlight.  The metallic finish is also part of the structural system itself.  It will be supporting the vertical and lateral loads.
- This building will provide jobs, enhance property values and will promote the area as a place to do business.
(+) Rem Coolhouse – Project Architect
- He is aware of the issues the department has and has tried to address all of them.

(+) Jeannette Etheridge
- She knows nothing about architecture but she was born and raised in San Francisco and recalls how exciting it is to have a City so vibrant.   She would like the same for her children.
(+) Keith Plymill – Architect
- He is not here as an architect but as a human being.
- He came to San Francisco because it is such an exciting City.
- There is a sense of experimentation here.
- He hopes that the Commission approves this project.
(+) Stanley Getti
- It is not surprising that every turn of the century something exiting is built in this City.
- We are interested in the future.
- He agrees with everything that everyone has said and hopes that the Commission approves this project.
(-) Frederick P. Furth – The Furth Film
- He is here to give one simple message.  He attempted to get the engineering report on their earthquake study and they refused to give it.

(-) Dr. Charles Thiel

- No one has come to them to get their opinion on the proposed building.
- She would like to be a good neighbor and right now she is being ignored.  This building will have a negative impact on her and her business.
(-) Anthony Hay
- Homeowner on Post Street. 
- He agrees with the recommendation from staff.
- Why isn't PRADA doing this in their own backyard?
- This building will be an obsolete building in a few years.

Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project as submitted.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Art Fung - 
- He lives 4 houses away from subject property.
- The DR requestor could not come to the hearing so he will be representing him.
- There is a petition from 26 neighbors who oppose this project.
- He displayed photographs of the streetscape and the homes in the neighborhood in order to show that the homes in the neighborhood are not larger than 4 bedrooms.
- He disagrees with the staff findings.
(-) Alfredo Jordan
- He has a list of neighbors who are opposed to the project.
- He is opposed to this project since he believes that this house will become a rental.
- There will be traffic problems on an already congested street.
(-) Kathy Reichardt
- She is opposed to the project since the neighborhood character will not be preserved.
- She is also concerned about the height of the project.
- She was not given any notification of this project.
(-) Rhoda Singer
- She is against this project because it will block the light coming into her bedroom.
(-) Charles Washington
- He lives in front of the proposed construction.
- He will have the sunlight of his home blocked.
(-) Loren Christensen
- He is opposed to this project since it will block the light from his home and his chimney will no longer work.
(-) Cynthia Mitchell
- She and her husband are opposed to the third story.
- She is also against the 7 bedrooms and 5 baths.  A house of this size will have several persons of driving age.
- She is concerned about the safety on the street because of the increase in cars.
(-) Alfred Jordan
- He is opposed to this project because a home of 7 bedrooms and 5 baths is not in accordance with the other homes in the neighborhood.
- This project would block light to adjacent homes.
- There will be more traffic problems on the street.
- He believes that this house will become a rental.
(-) John Madden
- He is opposed to this project because the house will have 7 bedrooms and 5 baths, he has stayed at bed and breakfast inns that have had less rooms.
(-) Daniel Rodriguez
- He will loose another hour or so of sunlight if this project is approved.
- He is against the 3rd Story.  He knows that there has been a lot of construction work done without permits on the proposed project.
(-) Noreen Rodriguez
She is opposed to this project.  She is concerned about the aesthetics of the neighborhood.
- This project will be incompatible with the rest of the homes.
- A seven bedroom and 5 bath home leads you to believe it will be multi-unit living.  This is very suspicious.
(-) Louis F. Reichardt, Ph.D.
- He has lived in the neighborhood for many years.  During those years several of his neighbors have made additions and have had construction work done to their homes but they have kept the work within the guidelines of the neighborhood.
- This project will negatively impact the neighborhood.
- He knows that much of the work done to this house was been done without a permit.
(+) Jeremy Paul
- He is finding out a lot of things he did not know.
- There is a lot of misinformation.
- He would like to ask the Commission for time to be able to address the questions and concerns. 
- The pictures shown seemed to carefully exclude corner lots.
- There were many changes made to this project.
- The top story was set back.  The entrance to the basement from the street has been removed from the plans.  The bedroom count is misleading.  This is for use as a single family home.
- He believes that there is a problem with the rear stair.  He understood that he was here to represent a fully-coded project but it appears that it is not.
- This house--as it is currently--is far more out of character with the surroundings than the house that is being proposed.
ACTION:          Took Discretionary Review and Disapproved the Project.
AYES:          Baltimore, Fay, Joe, Lim, Theoharis, Salinas
