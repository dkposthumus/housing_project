      and world image

Last year in the annual meeting 
      of the National Trust for Historic Preservation was a little dishearting 
      hear some of the speakers mentioned the City of San Francisco as
 
a example of a city that failed to effectively 
      protect its historic resources






-
           
      




The Webster Street Historical District 
      is one of the few effort for preservation that we had made, and without 
      the public participation, particularly in the form of the Friends of Webster 
      Street Historical District.






-
           
      




Smith Kettlewell failured to comply 
      with the requirements of that historic district, it would have gone unnoticed 
      to the Department and unknown to this Commission






-
           
      




On the institution past behavior, 
      it is only reasonable to expect that the neighborhood and the public at 
      large, would be skeptical of their future behaviors 






-
           
      




Urge Commission

master plan can be heard, evaluated for appropriateness and determined 
      that are true and effective means for enforcement that would be put in place

-
           
      




One of the conditions was not to 
      expand in further north from this building






-
           
      




No content with these institutions 
      began to buy five more Victorian houses, all in the City's first designated 
      historic district.






-
           
      




The neighborhood curious, why these 
      houses were deteriorating, discovered that these houses were using for offices 
      and housing






-
           
      




Neighbors organized and petitioned 
      the Planning Department, who ordered this institution to stop this usage 
      and submit an abbreviated master plan






-
           
      




Master Plan is very abbreviated; 
      it is conspicuous for what it does not say.






-
           
      




This is organization that has a 
      long history or arrogance and duplicity






-
           
      




If you think his characterization 
      of them as arrogant is exaggerated, consider that the appealing the Planning 
      Department requirements that seize the illegal use of one this building, 
      it is at the Board of Appeals right now.






-
           
      




This organization has a huge impact 
      in the surrounding neighborhood and literally affect hundreds of people

Urge Commission to schedule a public 
      hearing
 
 


(-) Ruth 
      Poole, Chief Operating Officer at Smith Kettlewell Institute


-
 
 
Sad 
      that the neighborhood feel the way that they do


-
 
 
We have tried to have a good harmony with neighborhood and hid anything 
      from the neighborhood or the Planning Commission 


-
 
 
Renovated 
      the building on Webster Street 


-
 
 
No intention 
      of these buildings been thorn down






-
           
      




We have done everything that has 
      been possible 






-
           
      




Urge the Commission to approve their 
      master plan


(-) Donald 
      Langley






-
           
      




Since them abbreviate the General 
      Plan is not a plan at all, does not show clue to the institute future, its 
      development, its use of existing houses or its intention regarding other 
      houses in the area






-
           
      




A full must held to learn what this 
      institute is going to do


-
 
 
They 
      had fixed the houses after pressure from the neighbors


-
 
 
There 
      is a notice of violation regarding meeting at Board of Permit Appeals


-
 
 
Notice 
      was received a day before the deadline


-
 
 
Suggest 
      enforcing restrictions 


-
 
 
This 
      a friendly neighborhoods


-
 
 
All 
      the houses have been converted into offices


(-) Beverly 
      McCallister


1996 when 
      the Planning Commission allowed this institute to build this concrete research 
      building, stated that shouldn't be not further north structural expansion 
      or the in hospital related activities, because the fragile nature of the 
      historic nature surrounded, They expanded north anyway. 


-
 
 
Violated 
      the Planning Code


-
 
 
This 
      is a historic district


-
 
 
Request a full hearing, due to neighbors no knowing how this institution 
      planning to use this buildings


(-) John 
      Sanger, Sanger and Olson


-
 
 
Speaking 
      on behalf of the Institute 


-
 
 
Institute 
      has done everything that had been required by the Zoning Administrator






-
           
      



      Institute would go by the Planning Code and the Building Code as a been 
      interpreted by the Zoning Administrator






-
           
      



      The only reason anything is on appeal to the Board of Permit Appeals is 
      because we can not determine what more is to be done with respect to outstanding 
      notice of violation 






-
           
      



      Despite the fact every building on Webster Street has been vacated and the 
      institute master plan has committed that they would in the future be occupy 
      for residential purposes in accordance with Planning Code is still an outstanding 
      notice of violation






-
           
      




ZA indicated that would like to 
      withdrawn the appeal, if someone is send to inspect to determine that compliances 
      have been achieved.






-
           
      




Allegations that have made regarding 
      the institute to disrespect for the neighborhood are really outrageous, 
      this like re-living the hearing that occurred before the Commission in 1961. 
      


(-) John 
      Barbey






-
           
      




We have difficulty of enforcement 
      from the Planning Department and Landmarks Board


-
 
 
There 
      is not budget for enforcement


-
 
 
This 
      obviously illustrate the vulnerability of an historic district in San Francisco


 
 
This 
      institute has been very disingenuous 


-
 
 
Offices 
      are not residential uses






-
           
      




They have to re-establish the confidence 
      of the public that they are going to be good neighbors

We should 
      hold a full hearing

During Summer our neighborhood

Building on Oakwood

There are only 8 parking spaces 
      available






-
           
      




Allow the same parking 
      spaces as the same of apartments buildings






-
           
      




Negative Declaration 
      says that traffic is horrible






-
           
      




It is disrespectful 
      and insulting to the neighbors






-
           
      




Support housing, but 
      this project is not a good idea to our neighborhood






-
           
      




Size of this building

      1979






-
           
      




Only the southern portion 
      of it was able to build on this model, it shows what it is proposed to be 
      build






-
           
      




Formerly on this lot 
      was a warehouse, it walls were 14 feet high, this warehouse was there for 
      70 years, and this whole neigborhood was built around it.






-
           
      




There was no zoning 
      during those years 






-
           
      




When this warehouse 
      was put there, it was put there with the sense that there were livable units, 
      in the west side of this building on Guerrero St.

There won't be any green

Urge to look the proportional

      and vote against as it stand






-
           
      




The consequences that 
      this project would have in this residential are phenomenal






-
           
      




Instead of two comparable 
      house of single block 140 and 144 units we would have two very lot sided 
      house 183 and 144 units






-
           
      




We would a very limited 
      open space 






-
           
      




Urge to vote against 
      this project

Thank the Department 
      of Public Health for scrutiny that they applied to this project, specially 
      in consideration of the sensitive nature of this development






-
           
      




Lacks a certain amount 
      of specificity in particular with respect to the analysis that are proposed






-
           
      




Previous analysis at 
      the site did not include analysis for the most toxics components associated 
      with petroleum hydro carbons which are the type of contaminants that have 
      detected at the site






-
           
      




The mitigation plan 
      does not include provisions to monitor dust during construction, would recommend 
      putting three mini ramp devices, these aerosol monitoring devices up around 
      the perimeter of the site, to ensure that residents are not exposed to dust 
      or potential hazards quimical at an unacceptable concentration






-
           
      




The site mitigation 
      plan indicate the soil sampling plan would be submitted, once the building 
      design is complete, he believes, that this is inappropriate, the soil sampling 
      should be incorporated as a part of the site mitigation plan

All materials, debris

Take in consideration as you deliver

      a project significantly smaller than this in 1979, there had to be some

Do not think that a former non compliance use, 
      should be use like this cottage houses, there are several of them, that 
      were made into residential units should be use as an excuse to introduce 
      new non compliance structures into the mid block.




 


-
 
These houses were built before there 
      was any zoning 


-
 
 
There 
      is not open space, it is very minimal

This do not seems a fair argument

Project is situated in a steep hill

-
           
      




 
Only access to the site is on Yerba Buena Avenue, and it is already


heavily over traffic local street






-
           
      




Permit is been contested provide 
      for the building of a road way , which will sit in an unsafe distance from 
      the residential house, and because it will facilitate the over building 
      on the site






-
           
      




This is a crucial point on the project, 
      if the site has 55 foot access road, which currently does, it could be develop
