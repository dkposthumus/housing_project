(Continued from Regular Meeting of November 1, 2001)
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Bob McCarthy – Representing Project Sponsor
- This project had many challenges but provided many opportunities.
- The challenges were to provide a building that will meet the office needs of downtown; preserve an important historic resource – the mining building; would not interfere with the historic courtyard of the Russ Building; and would not have an adverse impact on St. Mary's Park–instead it will enhance it by adding sunshine instead of shadows.
- This project will also contribute money to affordable childcare, transportation impact fees, the downtown parks fund, public art, and provides additional open space as a separate room that looks out from a glass wall.
(+) Jeffrey Heller – Heller/Manus Architects
- He presented a PowerPoint presentation.
- He submitted a letter from Heritage congratulating the architect for this project.
- EQE Structural Engineers commends this project on public safety.
- This building will be built with the highest seismic safety.
- There were three issues they had to deal with:  1) the historic aspects, 2) light/shadow and open space, and 3) zoning issues.
- The location of this project makes it part of the fabric of the downtown area.
- This project is a very comfortable, contextual fit with the surrounding buildings.
- Regarding the zoning issues--the building was designed to fit the envelope required by the code.
(+) Ken Connell – Exchange Barber Shop
- He is the owner of a shop close by.
- He agrees with this project since it will bring more business to the area.

(+) Gwyneth Borden – San Francisco Chamber of Commerce
- The Chamber of Commerce is located near by.

- He is against the continuance of this project because this corporation has had a lot of time to prepare and analyze this location.

SPEAKER(S):
(-) Kerrie Marshall

(-) Martin Marshall

- The only people who want these antennas are Willie Brown and Metro PCS.

Preliminary recommendation:  Take Discretionary Review and disapprove the proposed merger.
                    (Continued from Regular Meeting of November 1, 2001)
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Mark Thomas – Project Architect
- The Planning Department states that this project meets criteria 2, 3, and 5 and that criteria 4 is not applicable to this merger.
- This project also meets criteria 1 and the objectives of the planning code and the general plan since this project has been vacant for about 25 years.  This unit has not been available for the housing supply and there is no displacement or hardship.
- There are records that show that this house was originally two units in 1885-- consistent with the zoning and the density of the neighborhood.

- He hopes that the Commission approves this project to provide a home for his family and another San Francisco family without any detriment to the City.
(+) Steve Lepisto
- He was looking for a single family house or a two unit house so he wouldn't have to evict anyone.

SPEAKER(S):
(-) Mike Underhill – DR Requestor 
- He lives next door to the proposed project.
- He really has two separate issues:  1) demolition and 2) construction.
- He does have view and property value issues.  Yet the most important issue he has is the threat to his life and his family's.
- His main concern is that there is no consideration to the threat he and his family would have if there was a fire on the wall which is being built too close to a north facing window.
