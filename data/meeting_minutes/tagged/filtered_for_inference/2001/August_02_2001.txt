<<Project Start>>
5.          Commission Matters
Lim:                      Last month the Commission approved a housing project that has almost 200 units, and the Zoning Administrator indicated that he wanted to make sure that the housing is not for corporate housing but rather for permanent housing.  Do we need to insure or make a motion that we will recored a restriction on the deed, to make sure that the housing is for permanent housing?
Theoharis:           When the Sunshine Ordinance was inacted, appointed officials were required to take the Sunshine Ordinance training, do we have to do it again?          
          RESPONSE:  If you have taken the class you don't have to take it again.  However, once you have taken the class, you are required to annually submit a signed declaration that you have read the SF Sunshine Ordinance and received training.
