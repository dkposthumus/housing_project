The proposal is to permit the conversion of an industrial building to a non-profit health center, the Native American Health Center, at the second level without providing the required additional parking spaces.  Section 151 of the Planning Code requires that one off-street parking space be provided for each 300 square feet of occupied floor area in a NC-3 Zoning District.  The Native American Health Center would occupy 9,800 square feet of floor area.  Based on the floor area, 33 off-street parking spaces would be required.  The existing three-story building has a parking deficiency of 20 spaces, which results in a net increase of 13 required spaces.  The applicant proposes no additional parking spaces.
                    Note: On July 26, 2001, the Zoning Administrator continued this matter to August 9, 2001.

<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
5.          Commission Matters
Commissioner Chinchilla:
- Last week he received a resolution from Supervisor Leno urging the Planning Commission not to approve housing projects unless they impose 10% or whatever the language was.
- This resolution was based on false information.
- He communicated to the Supervisor and pointed out that the resolution was mistaken and untrue.
- He challenged the supervisor to identify specifically, any conditional use that this Commission or the department had approved a project.
- According to his recollection there has been a trend to go beyond the 10% minimum.
- The department has been very conscientious about how they approve projects.
- If the Supervisor had done his homework, the Supervisor would have realized that the projects where they had not imposed the 10% minimum is because it was not required.
Commissioner Baltimore: 
- Frequently she reads information on the housing needs of the City.  The information that is not included is what level or cost range of housing is needed.
- She would like staff to provide information to the Commission broken down by income group in order to know what moderate income was, what low income was, along with the housing that has been produced in the past year.

                    INDUSTRIAL ZONE – POLICIES AND PROCEDURES – Consideration of adoption of a resolution establishing policies and procedures for the industrially zoned portions of San Francisco.  The IPZ Interim Controls expiring on August 5, 2001 have encouraged housing developments in identified mixed-use housing zones and preserved PDR uses in the Industrial Protection Zones.  As the interim controls expire, policies and procedures need to be considered by the Planning Commission until such time that permanent Zoning controls can be developed within the community plan areas.  Noticed Planning Commission hearings were conducted on draft policy proposals on July 12th and July 19th of this year.
                    Preliminary Recommendation: Approve Resolution adopting policies and procedures for the industrially zoned portions of San Francisco.
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Stanley Muraoka – Project Manager for the Bay View Hunters Point Project - San Francisco Redevelopment Agency
- The agency supports an endorsement of the policies that Dr. Ghosh has proposed.
- They are currently engaged in a very intensive process with the Bay View Hunters Point Community through the project area committee.
- They are wrestling with what should remain in perpetuity as PDR as opposed to where it would be appropriate to provide for affordable housing production and economic development.
- These interim process and controls are very critical.
(+) Jon Twichell – Bay Area Transportation and Land Use Coalition
- This is an umbrella group of various land use and transportation groups.
- They want to encourage the Commission to include the current temporary map of housing along third street within the permanent IPZ controls rather than banning housing on third.
(+) Diane Oshima – Port of San Francisco
- She is the waterfront Planning Manager for the Port of San Francisco.
- They are in support of the policies that are proposed in terms of maintaining an orderly process and the integrity of the existing industrial areas.
- The industrial transportation access for trucks and freight rail are all integral to making sure that the port's maritime mission can be maintained.
- She applauds this process for establishing these policies.
(+) Julie Milburn – 7th Street Commercial Association/CCAC
- They have done a lot of work in the lower Potrero Hill and Showplace Square area.
- They need planners who might assist them and realizes that staffing is an issue.
- She knows that there are plans for budgeting of staff.
(+) Reverend Cordell Hawkins – Bay View Hunters Point Project Team Committee
- They had a planner that was assigned to Bay View Hunters Point who assisted them regarding various projects.
- They are in desperate need for the department to assign a planner to this area.
- Please don't eliminate housing in this area.
(+) Jaime Rossi – San Francisco Chamber of Commerce
- The number one issue right now is housing.
- The plans, which are being drawn up now, are a little bit too restrictive since there is a housing crisis right now.
- He urges to allow the Commission the discretion to look at all these projects and not be so restrictive.
(-) Jim Meko – SOMA Leadership Council
- There is a lot of miscommunication about what is going to be accomplished.
- There is no disagreement that everyone wants to be part of the long-term process.
- A lot of the decisions, which the Commission has made, have to be undone.
- Drawing nice maps and writing nice words doesn't have action if nothing is done.
(-) Jim Chappel – President of SPUR
- This issue has moved dramatically backwards.
- There are problems in the existing memo since it doesn't really realize the community consensus about housing.
- This memo protects all uses of the PDR area.
- It doesn't let you consider the merits of the housing programs.
- This needs serious amendment.
(+) Steve Vettel – Morrison and Foerster
- He has a similar concern as the previous speaker.
- One important thing which needs to be included are to add a definition of PDR of what it is and what it is not.
- It is important if policy is to be written it needs to be written well.  Revised language will really go a long way.
(+) Bill Poland – Bay West Group
- He has been involved in developing and expanding the showplace square district.
- They own several of the substantial properties.
- It is truly a unique market center that deserves as much respect and recognition.
- He requests that the Commission take a careful look at this unique neighborhood.
- They have a map, which shows the real uses of this area, which he can provide to the Commissioners.
- They are planning to add a substantial amount of rental residential so that employees and showroom owners can live nearby.
(+) Greg Asay – Office of Supervisor Maxwell
- He is a legislative aid for Supervisor Maxwell's office.
- On July 9, Supervisor Maxwell introduced legislation that would create interim zoning controls for parcels that adjoin 3rd Street south of Islais Creek.  The interim zoning would be until the redevelopment plan is finalized in conjunction with the Bay View Hunters Point Project area.
- They hope to have this legislation to the Board of Supervisors by next month.
- There is clear intent by the Board of Supervisors to encourage neighborhood commercial zoning along Third Street south of Islais Creek, both in support of and supported by the Third Street Light Rail Project.
(+) Mary Murphy – Farella, Braum and Martel, LLP
- It is important for the Commission to clarify that this does not in any way obviate or constrain what the Commission has as a conditional use authority in those areas where certain uses can be permitted conditionally but not as a principal use within that authority.
- This language doesn't seem to address the conditional use.
(+) Quintin Mecke – SOMAD
- He has a few technical questions regarding the proposed policies and procedures: what does office include?  Does office include business services?  Does office include information technology?  Does office include biotech?  Office seems to be too broad.
- Regarding the Showplace Square, he feels that the procedure should not be parcel by parcel.
- He is in support of stricter controls.
(+) Lawrence Thibeaux – ILWU Local 10
- There are about 100 members that live or work in the Bay View Hunter's Point area.
- Their main concern is about housing too close to the port.

- There is now a small area of the port where there is actual port activities going on.
- They don't have a problem with houses in the Third Street corridor.
(+) Michael Hamman – PAC
- He is a resident of the Bay View.
- With all the changes going on in this area, they are witnessing another  Oklahoma land rush .
- He is here to say thank you for keeping this at bay until they have had enough time to put forward their own plan.
- They would like to have mandatory discretionary review until the plan is adopted this fall.
- They would like to have the opportunity to study and comment on all projects in the survey area so they can have an adequate plan.
- They no longer have a planner to work with, so a mandatory discretionary review would be appropriate.
(+) Dan Dodt
- He is a member of the Bay View Hunter's Point Committee.
- He urges the Commission to extend the discretionary controls immediately to close the window now open by the suspension of the interim controls and adopt the resolution as drafted and to recognize the unfinished business of the PAC and the vision of the residents.
(+) David Cincotta
- He is to talk about housing.  He has been working on housing for the past 30 years.
- He was really disappointed in the plan that discouraged housing.
- Discouraged housing means not to allow housing.  It is not necessary to do this to protect the PDR uses being talked about right now.
- There have always been competing pressures on land uses.
- He is just suggesting that this plan appears to have given up this struggle.  This is not the way the Commission has acted in the past.
(+) Sue Hestor
- She received from Dr. Ghosh the revisions which were not read.
- She feels that it is unfair that this information was not read into the record.
- Things should be balanced and not looked at parcel by parcel.
- This case should be continued since it wasn't read properly into the record before people testified.
(+) Did not state name
- She would like to look at each sub area quickly and prioritize some areas and as they come out of community based planning; some areas can be dropped off.
ACTION:          Resolution Adopted with the following amendments:  1) adding the word protection to paragraph 1 so that it reads,  Industrial Protection Zone ; and 2) the first bullet point on that paragraph reads  discourage the new development of/or conversion of existing uses to office, housing, or live/work.

          14b.          2001.0202CV          (LI: 558-6396)
                    136-142 TAYLOR STREET - east side between Eddy and Turk Streets; Lot 014 in Assessor’s Block 0340 -- Rear yard, usable open space, and dwelling unit exposure variances sought.  The proposal is to convert a vacant commercial building to a mixed-use building containing six dwelling units above ground-floor retail space within an RC-4 (Residential-Commercial Combined, High Density) District, the North of Market Residential Special Use District, and an 80-120-T Height and Bulk District.  There will be no physical expansion of the existing building.  The Planning Code requires the provision of a rear yard (Section 134), usable open space (Section 135), and dwelling unit exposure (Section 140).  The project will not provide a rear yard or usable open space, and three of the dwelling units would not have the required exposure.  The application for variance will be considered by the Zoning Administrator.

Jeff Ma
Re:  tickets
- Recently the Board of Supervisors and the Department of Parking and Traffic are increasing tickets in order to deal with driving blocking issues.
- This has forced property owners to waking up at 7:00 a.m. when garbage trucks are honking because they can't get through or they will just not pick up the trash.
- Projects are being approved for development, extra rooms and bedrooms on streets that really can't support it.
