Re:
 
Live/Work to Loft Housing Legislation

by Supervisors' Daly, Amiano and Maxwell that would establish a 6-month
moratorium on the consideration of live/work units.
 
A companion piece would prohibit any action on these applications
and would create a retroactive period of 60 days.
 
Any applications that were before the Commission that have not
been approved cannot be approved within that period of time.

legislation was just referred to the Department yesterday (1/17/01).

DWELLING UNIT MERGER POLICY


 
Policy discussion
on the removal of dwelling units.


Consider adopting criteria for Discretionary Review of building permit
applications to remove a legal dwelling unit.


 


 
SPEAKER(S):


(-) Dean and Catherine Akazawa


- They purchased a property on
Bush Street last year.


- They would like for the
Commissioners not to penalize projects that are in the pipeline.


- Their project would allow for a
family of six to live as one family by merging units.


- They have spent considerable
time and resources to merge the units.


They are not doing this for business purposes.
 
They have not displaced anyone.


- They were supposed to have
started their project in September.


Their contractor advised them that the project would last about 3 months
but because of this new policy, they haven't been able to even start their
project.


- His wife is expecting twins and
this is causing a lot of hardship and stress to their lives.


(-) Susanne Beilicke – Sanger and
Olson


- They have not had an opportunity
to review the criteria.


- She would like to request that
this matter is continued for two weeks to allow for through revision of the
criteria and allow for a presentation.


(-) Jeremy Paul


- He represents small property
owners.


- He would like to alert this
Commission of the consequences if this policy is approved.


- The courts, City Attorney and
BOA are clear that they will not prevent Ellis Acted properties from being
merged.


- There will be a substantial loss
of housing because of this kind of action.


- Please consider a way to avoid
the loss of housing.


(-) Randy Shaw – Director of the
Tenderloin Housing Clinic


- Housing is lost with mergers.


- Homes should remain with the
original configuration.


- There is a scarcity of rental
housing.


(-) Kim Stryker


- She is one of two-co chairs of 


- She is amazed at the amount of
interference the City puts for homeowners.


- They supply 1/3 of the City's
rental housing.


- They end of taking their units
off the market because of all the policies that need to be adhered to.


- Homeowners should be able to use
their homes for growing families.


- Homeowners would like to merge
illegal units in order to make them legal.


- It's not of the City's business
how much these rental units are.


- She would like the Commission to
reevaluate the policy and not put so many burdens on property owners.


(-) Courtney Clarkson


- She purchased a 2-unit building
recently which was originally a 1 unit home and her intention was to make as it
was before.


- It seems like the Commission is
making it difficult for a small amount of people to merge rental housing.


- At the corner of Fillmore and
Lombard there was a gas station, a 1-story building was constructed there.
 
Enormous volume spaces are being built as
lofts instead of rental housing units.


(-) Andrew Zaks


- He is an attorney for small
property owners.


- There will be unintended affects
that this policy will produce.


- There will be more Ellic Act
cases.


- He would like the Commission to
reconsider this policy.


- He believes that this policy is
a bad policy.


(-) J.B. Alijani


- He is a small property owner.


- This policy gives the reason to
not add rental units in a house.


- He agrees with the previous
speaker that homeowners Ellis Acts units.


- It will be bad for San Francisco
to have all these Ellis Act buildings.


- Ways should be looked for so people
can have rental housing.


(-) Will Spritzma


- He is upset that he has to take
time out of his life to come here and protect his property.


- If these types of policies are
going to be implemented, properties who were started from a certain date should
not qualify for Discretionary Review.


(-) Joe O'Donahue


- He sympathizes with families who
want to merge units because their family is growing.


- This policy should be addressed
at the Board of Supervisors.


- This Commission should not try
to solve this problem.


(-) Robin Levit


-
He owns property just a few blocks from here.


- He purchased the property with
the intention of merging the units.


- His parents are very old and
they saw this as providing housing for them.


- People, who have bought these
buildings, purchased them with the idea of merging the units.


- Small property owners should not
be penalized.


(-) Andy Esparza


- He owns property.
 
He purchased the property after renting it
for a few years.


- These types of regulations are
causing him to get education on how these policies work.


- He will find out what the Ellis
Act means to him and what the implications are.


- He has tenants that have lived
in the property for many years.
 
He
won't hesitate to Ellis Act the tenants he has currently.


(-) Lou Lecnito


- This is terrible to have such
hard restrictions on small people that can help their children.


(-) Brett Gladstone


- He is an attorney.
 
He has had a number of calls from homeowners
so he can represent them.


- The costs for people to go
through a Discretionary Review is quite high.


- People get nervous and have a
hard time speaking before the Commission.


- He would like the Commission to
consider this policy.


(-) Craig Lipton


- He is a small property owner.


- He is affected by this policy.


- He understands that there is a
housing crisis map.


(-) Linda Allen


- She is a small property owner.


- She is confused and uncertain to
question the intelligence of this policy or the sincerity of the Commissioners.


- This new rule will cause more
Ellis Acts and not apply to the Commission at all.
 
There will be more illegal units created.


(-) John Bardis


- The people who have spoken today
have all mentioned that there is a housing crisis.


- The existing housing stock is
the more affordable housing stock in the City.


- What is the better
solution?
 
Maybe the City has not been
clear in the way the City has developed this policy.


- This is something that should be
followed up by the Board.


- A clear solution, in ordinance
form, should be established.


- People, who purchased prior to
adoption of first policy, should receive priority to go before the Commission.


- Staff should provide help to
property owners to fill out forms, get information, etc.


 


ACTION:
 
Approved with modifications.
 
Staff to report on January 25, 2001 on the
status of DR's, which are in the pipeline for dwelling unit mergers.
 
A special hearing would probably be
scheduled just for these types of cases in order to expedite these cases.

renovate the property.


- Although they might relocate to
another part of the Bay Area since their business requires it be located on a
pier.


- E.F. Evans has agreed to
purchase the site.


- He has been a loyal businessman
of San Francisco and it's not fare that this decision will have a tremendous
impact on him.


(-) Steve Vettel


- This is a rather unusual case.


- The EIR of this project was
certified in August.
 
The project
sponsor was not able to develop this property because the office allocation had
run out so they had to wait for this year in order to qualify.


- He submitted a paragraph, which
he would like to have the Commission consider as an amendment.


- He would like cases to be
considered which were ready to be considered by the Commission before the
policy was enacted.


(-) Robert Meyers


- He is an architect and a
city-planning consultant.


- He would like to place an
operative date of November 7 so projects before this date should be exempt.

- There are cases, which should be
exempt of this policy.


- Many cases have been at the
Planning Department for many years.


- If an exemption is made, the
Commission will not set a precedent.


- He agrees with the Director of
the Planning Department on this policy.


(-) Sue Hestor


- This approval of this policy is
ridiculous based on the history of the department.


- There have been huge
controversies on Industrial Zones.

Sections 102.7 and 102.13 redefining "live/work" units as "loft
housing" and classifying them as residential uses; repealing Section 233
regarding live/work; adding Section 232 to establish requirements for loft

than the other homes in the neighborhood.


- The design of the structure
makes it appealing yet it is too large for this neighborhood.


- He showed a diagram of the
homes, which have a rear deck.


- He has lived in this
neighborhood for many years and has seen the neighborhood change throughout the
years, yet this house is just too large.


- The DR requestors spent time
with the developers.
 
The revisions made
to the original plans are merely cosmetic and not related to the bulk of the
house.


- Showed an image of a shadow
study made.


(-) Richard Peterson


- The proposed project is totally
out-of-scale in comparison to the rest of the houses.


- This house will have 6
bathrooms, where the rest of the houses in the neighborhood only have one.


- Revisions made to the plans are
only cosmetic.


- An area in the house where a bar
is planned could easily be converted into a kitchen.
 
There are other areas of the house, which could easily be
converted to other things; therefore, the property could be converted into an
apartment building.


- The height of this house will
impact the public open space.


- This is the perfect example of a
mega mansion.


(-) Richard Estes Richardson


- He is one of a few people who
object to this project.


- He lives down the hill of the
proposed project.


- He has lived there for about 30
years


- This project will change the
character of the neighborhood.


- The height of the house will be
intrusive.


- He supports the design review.


- He would have liked to have more
neighbors receive notification of this project.


(-) Harvey Rudman


- He lives in the neighborhood.


- He feels that the developers
have address some of his concerns.


- The building will create a wall,
which will run across most of the property.


- There was no attempt to contact
homeowners regarding this project.


- The homeowners and not the
developers requested the meetings that were set up.


(+) Brett Gladstone


- There were a total of 5 meetings
with the neighbors.
 
Two were formal and
3 were informal.


- Most of the cut backs were on
the side of the project.


- Bay windows were removed


- Many people are coming to him
because they can't seem to find a house that is large enough for growing
families.


(+) Steve Antenaros - Project
Architect


- December 21 (Winter Solstice)
would be the worst-case scenario which is when the sun is at its lowest
therefore shadows at anytime during the day are the worst that it would be
during any other day of the year.


- All the revisions of the
original plan were taken into consideration in regards to impact to the
neighbors.


(+) Joe O'Donahue


- Every building this architect
has designed has been good to the neighborhood.


- This building does not max out.


- This project should be approved.

481
ARKANSAS STREET
, 
Request for Discretionary Review
for Building Permit Application No. 200003245373 for the property at 481
Arkansas Street, Lot 012A in Assessor’s Block 4068.
 
The proposal is to add one dwelling unit to an existing single
family, two-story residence by constructing a one floor plus penthouse vertical
addition.
 
The subject property falls
within a RH-2 (Residential, Two-family) Zoning District and a 40-X Height /
Bulk District.


 
Preliminary
Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and approve the project with
modifications.


 


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Tom Davie


- He lives on the block of the
proposed construction.


- He read a timeline of events
since September of 2000.


- He objects to the side yard
entrance to the proposed lower unit.


- People who will be coming up and
down the stairs will be able to look into his kitchen and dining room.


- Even if the stairs were
enclosed, the design would just not fit in that space.


- Most of the new houses on this
street are two-stories over garage.


- He does not feel that he is
incorrect in quoting something that Mr. De La Cruz sent to him.


(-) Craig Forrestor


- He has lived in Potrero Hill
since 1989.


- He has objections about this
project: this will cause a negative affect on the look of the neighborhood; the
construction is too large for the neighborhood; the structure will impact
sunlight; privacy of adjacent neighbors.


- He strongly believes in wanting
to keep the look of the neighborhood.


- The conversion of two units will
be a loss of dwelling for San Francisco.


- Because of the fact that the new
construction is about double compared to the other houses, it will impact the
sunlight to these houses.


(-) Heather Fitzgibons


- This project will not add any
positive value to the other homes in this neighborhood.


- This large structure will change
the feeling of the neighborhood.


- She works at home and spends a
lot of time there; this construction will invade her privacy and block the
sunlight coming into her home.


(-) Alain Demour


- He lives in the neighborhood.


- He purchased his property there
because of the look of the neighborhood.


- The construction will invade his
privacy.


(+) Phil De la Cruz


- He owns the property with his
son.


- Staff has requested that this
project be modified.


- Since November of 2000, he
hasn't been able to come before the Commission because of family emergencies.


- The construction would add value
to the other properties.


- Displaced a diagram comparing
the height of the adjacent homes.


 


ACTION:
 
Take DR and approve project with modifications proposed
by staff.
