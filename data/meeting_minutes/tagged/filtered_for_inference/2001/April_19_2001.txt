ISSUANCE 
      OF TAXI MEDALLIONS – CITYWIDE
 - 
Appeal 
      of Preliminary Negative Declaration.


The San Francisco Taxi Commission, 
      City and County of San Francisco, proposes to issue approximately 500 additional 
      taxi permits ("medallions"). After implementation of the project, 
      the number of taxi permits available in the City would increase from 1,381 
      to 1,881, an increase of approximately 36%.
 
New permits may be issued if supported by a 
      finding that additional permits are required to meet the public convenience 
      and necessity.
 
Once issued, the 
      permits would result in 500 additional taxis in use. Operation of taxis 
      in the City limits is subject to regulation and review by the San Francisco 
      Taxi Commission.
 
Proposition K, 
      a 1978 initiative ordinance governing the operation of taxis in the City, 
      requires that the permits, once issued, be operated continuously.

Commission Matters




Commissioner Salinas:
 
He 
      has had the good fortune of participating on two other Commissions:
 
Park and Rec and Police, yet he has been greatly disturbed about 
      the comments being made about this Commission.


Although he is not asking for appreciation, it is unfortunate, and 
      it does the public a disservice, to demean the work that this Commission 
      does.





       
      






Commissioner Theoharis:
 
She 
      has a letter for a continuance for the project located at 4038 17
th
 
      Street.
 
This project was granted a continuance last 
      year.
 
The sponsor waived the streamlining 
      act for a one-time, 90-day continuance.
 
The City Attorney mentioned that this could be done only once.


This matter is scheduled for May 10
th
 and the sponsor 
      would like to reschedule for June 7
th
.
 
Therefore, another continuance cannot be granted 
      so the project will be heard on May 10
th
. Staff should notify 
      sponsor of this rule.

NOTE:
 
On March 8, 2001, after public testimony, the Commission closed public

The item was continued

The item continues to be subject to Commission consideration, deliberation

On March 22, 2001, the Commission considered a revised proposal that 
      would reduce the total square footage of the project to 49,500 square feet.
 
Following discussion, the Commission continued 
      this matter to April 19, 2001, to allow the sponsor to submit new plans, 
      to allow the new project to be properly noticed, and to allow adequate time 
      for Department staff, the Commission, and the public to review the new plans.




SPEAKER(S):




(+) David Cincotta – Representing Sponsors:


McCarthy Cook and Payne Weber




- He would like to talk about the residential portion of this project.
 
The first time a residential portion of this 
      project was considered was many years ago and there was an alternative to 
      study residential.
 
This was in December 
      of 1999.
 
In the last month and a 
      half, there has been more consideration on residential.
 
The most significant reason is seeing the mixed-use reality of Mission 
      Bay.
 
There has been more construction 
      for office and residential space.




- The parking and traffic situation will be addressed through allowed 
      valet parking.
 
They meet the demands 
      for valet parking.




- They have talked to their supporters and they are still in agreement 
      with the new proposal.




- The voluntary contributions for childcare, etc., are still in place.




- The design conditions were worked out with Mission Housing Development.




- Because of the change of the focus of this project, they felt it 
      was an opportunity with a fresh design team.


MBH architects are familiar with the area.




(+) Andres Grecci – MBH Architects




- They have been involved with designing Brannan Square, Moma's Restaurant, 
      177 Townsend Mixed Use project, and they have an understanding of where 
      the neighborhood is going and what it needs.




- They first looked at PacBell Park as a basis of where they should 
      start.




- There were a series of elements, which were very important in attaining 
      the desired design.




- One of these elements was a transitional floor to tie the addition 
      to the existing building.
 
This floor 
      occurs in the fourth floor, which would tie the housing and the office elements.




- Another big element was that the towers would break down the long 
      mass of the building with more vertical elements.


This building was too horizontal and too long.




- The courtyard, which is between two buildings, needs to be revitalized.




- The building now feels like a whole building instead of an existing 
      building with an addition.




- Linking this building from what it was to what it could be and 
      the changes in the neighborhood is a very important element, and keeping 
      the existing curtain wall does it.




(+) Jeffrey Liebovitz




- He is speaking on behalf of the members of the Rincon Point/South 
      Beach CAC; he would like to thank the project sponsor for considering a 
      resolution to request removing the gates at the end of the wharf along Mission 
      Creek and allow more activities along the wharf such as leashed dog walking.




- This public benefit will help address item 3 of the CUA, where 
      the project sponsor seeks a rear yard exception for residential units.
 
They support the development of the additional 
      68 residential units.




- This Commission and the developer are giving back to San Franciscans 
      and the public what BCDC mistakenly gave away many years ago in its infancy 
      of the Bay Conservation Development Commission Permit Negotiations process.
 
Today BCDC would never allow public improvements 
      along the waterfront to be closed off with gates.




- This condition will allow for another segment of the continuation 
      of the bay trail and make a natural connection to the shoreline improvements 
      in Mission Bay and along Mission Creek.


They are still troubled by the 5-to-8-year time frame in which this 
      action will occur.
 
He would like 
      to have an amendment for the removal of the gates with the completion of 
      the N2 block of Mission Bay or two years after issuance of the CUP whichever 
      occurs first.




(+) Dick Millet – Potrero Hill




- He has been watching this project for many years and had problems 
      with the building being too tall and the parking problem but this has been 
      resolved.




- The whole community in this area is new.




- He hopes that the overhead wires will be removed, since they didn't 
      show in the renderings, so he assumes that they have taken them out.




(+) Sue Hestor




- This is a really huge improvement.




- The improvements are stunning and are worthy of the Commissioners' 
      approval.




- The waterfront should be opened up as quickly as possible.




- The nature of China Basin is changing so dramatically.




- This is a much better design.

      units proposed at the site (in this case the interior pedestrian courtyard 
      and the air space above is where the rear yard for the proposed units would 
      be located per Planning Code Section 134, there 
is currently no rear 
      yard situated within the existing development nor would it be physically 
      possible to provide one on the site without removing floors of the adjacent 
      Wharfside building). No rear yard is proposed. The property is within a 
      M-2 (Heavy Industrial) District, the Mixed Use Area of the IPZ Industrial 
      Protection Zone), the proposed Ballpark Vicinity Special District’s South

      per the City & County of San Francisco’s Wireless Transmission Services 
      (WTS) Facilities Siting Guidelines, the proposal is a preference 6 (limited 
      preference site).


Preliminary Recommendation: 
Approval with Conditions





       
      




 
SPEAKER(S):


 
(+) Robert Crebs – Representing 
      Project Sponsor




- This petition complies with the San Francisco Municipal Code, the 
      WTS Sighting Guidelines and the Federal Communication Commissions Radio 
      Frequency Emissions Standards.




- The design is visually unobtrusive.




- The proposed installation is necessary for this area.




- All sites of a higher preference were considered or pursued yet 
      they were not technologically feasible or not available for lease.




- A CU is allowed if the proposed structure is necessary or desirable 
      for and comparable with the neighborhood and the community.




- This facility will ensure communication when LAN lines are not 
      working and it will increase safety for residents and citizens of San Francisco 
      from wireless phones.




- Bilingual community meetings were held.




(-) Erick Olsen




- He is here to address the health concerns.


He is a property owner directly around the corner from the proposed 
      site.




- Although the studies up to date have been inconclusive, there is 
      a certain amount of evidence that there are health hazards with these antennas.




- His main question is what can he do to try to block this or find 
      research, which he can present to the Commission, to deny this project?

 - south side between 1st 
      and 2nd Streets; Lot 110 in Assessor's Block 3736.
 
Request for Conditional-Use Authorization pursuant to Section 219(d) 
      of the Planning Code to establish an office use at the ground floor level 
      which will not offer on-site services to the general public within the C-3-0(SD) 
      (Downtown Office Special Development) District and a 350-S Height and Bulk 
      District.
 
The proposal is to demolish 
      the existing two-story-over-basement office building and construct a five-story-over-basement 
      office building containing approximately 11,000 square feet of gross floor 
      area.


Preliminary Recommendation: Approval





       
      




 
SPEAKER(S):


 
(+) Steve Vettel – Morrison and Forrester


 
- The only issue in this 
      CU is if it's appropriate to have the office space extend to the ground 
      floor and basement.
 
They believe 
      it is.
 
The site is so small that it is not feasible 
      for the ground floor to be used for non-office uses.


 
- The site is only 25 feet 
      wide.


 
- Part of the ground floor 
      is taken by the exit stairway.


 
- There is no other frontage 
      for retail or personal use.


 
- The only option is to 
      have the office space extend to the basement.


 
- It is not practical to 
      have a mixed-use building.


 
- The open space requirement 
      on this site is only 230 sf.
 
Because 
      the site is so small and so constrained it is not feasible to put that on 
      the ground floor of the site.


 
- The most feasible thing 
      to do is to extend the sidewalk and put in some benches and some landscaping.


 
(+) Jim Tanner – Tanner Architecture


 
- One of the things that 
      happen in the front of the building is that this building does not have 
      any access anywhere other than through the front of the building.
 
Two exits are required by the Building Department.


One exit is through a corridor.


The second exit is through the back of a stair.


By code this exit is allowed to go through the office space lobby.
 
If there was a retail functions on the ground floor, it would have 
      to have it's own exit.


 
- There is less than 20 
      feet of frontage to do this.


 
ACTION:
 
Approved as amended:

      to be brought before the Commission after it is properly noticed.

SPEAKER(S):




(+) David Silverman – Reuben and Alter




- This application was filed over a year ago and has gone through 
      many changes.




- The project complies with all the IPZ resolutions, residential 
      requirements, no variances are required, etc.




- This will be a positive contribution to the neighborhood.




- He, as well as the project architect, is available for any questions.




(+) Bill Minky 




- He owns the warehouse at 1050 Mississippi.




- This project will be an improvement all around.




(-) Dick Millet – Potrero Boosters




- Are there any drawings of this building?




- Was a 311 notice ever sent out?




- The building is too large and the parking doesn't work since the 
      entrance is too narrow.




- He has a problem with the fact that the two lower floors are 100% 
      lot coverage and the windows are set back for light and air.




- The buildings next door are lower than this project.




- The east side of Mississippi Street is big and brutal.




- There is too much PDR in this project.


It's designed as a loft.
 
The 
      elevator access doesn't work either.
 
The 
      units, which will be for sale, will have two cars and this can cause problems 
      in the parking area.




(-) Elena Myers




- She lives on Mississippi.




- She is also concerned about the height of the building.
 
They look like lofts.




- She would like to have a restriction imposed so there is no overnight 
      sleeping in the industrial units.
 
This 
      would protect them from the overuse of size in residential.




- The street is very jammed during the day.


This project should have its own loading dock.




(-) Favian Lanoy




- The 12-foot door is in compliance and is a requirement by the City.




- There is no problem for cars to move in and out of the garage.

Request 
      for a Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application No. 2000/07/13/5054S 
      to demolish an existing 11-foot, one-story horizontal extension and to construct 
      a two-story horizontal extension approximately 37 feet (including stairs) 
      at the rear of an existing two-story, single-family dwelling in an RH-1 
      (Residential, House, One-Family) District, and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.




Preliminary 
      Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and approve the project with modifications.





       
      




 
SPEAKER(S):




(-) Ambrose Luck – DR Requestor




- He has lived in his home since 1988.




- The reason he is here is because he received notification that 
      his neighbor would extend his property in the rear yard.




- He was surprised because when he purchased his property in 1988, 
      he found out about the zoning in the area and realized that his neighbor's 
      house had illegal rooms.




- His property suffered a fire and he has lived in it since then.




- His neighbor never uses the garage door to park their cars.




- He found out that the electrical permit hasn't been approved since 
      the fire.




- With all the space they have their request is not logical since 
      his neighbor's kids are older now.




- The whole basement in his neighbor's house is illegal.




(-) Sandra Wong – DR Requestor




- Her house is adjacent to the subject property.




- She requested that her neighbor not construct an extension.




- She will agree to an extension only if the recommendations from 
      the Planner are imposed:
 
1) reduce 
      the two-story horizontal extension from 30 feet to 25 feet so that subject 
      property will not be out of character with the neighborhood; 2) increase 
      setback from 3 feet to 4 feet in accordance with the residential design 
      guidelines; 3) eliminate all side facing windows on the proposed extension 
      to ensure neighbor's privacy; 4) issue a notice of special restrictions 
      so that proposed extension will not be used as a separate unit.




- She stresses the setback to be important because if the extension 
      is not set back, the rear yard boundary fence will have to be moved 3 inches 
      over onto her property.
 
This would 
      have a big impact on her since it would cause an impact on air, light and 
      privacy.




- She agrees with the planner's recommendations and if these recommendations 
      were put forth she would have no problem with the construction of the extension.




(-) Shirley Luck




- She lives at 1847 31
st
 Avenue.




- Her objection is that the neighbors will construct something legal 
      from an illegal construction.




- In the past, the neighbors have not applied for permits; that's 
      why there is an illegal construction.




- Her home suffered a fire and her car was burned because of her 
      neighbor.




- Her neighbor will build a kitchen in the basement because there 
      is an elderly person living there and this is very dangerous.


 
(-) Mable Wong – DR 
      Requestor




- Throughout the years, her neighbors and their contractors and handyman 
      have done construction without permits.




- Most of the time she is not home but when she comes home her neighbor 
      and their contractor do construction work yet walk all over her property.




- If the extension is built, this will cause a negative impact on 
      her property.




- Her neighbor is constantly constructing even on Saturdays.




- Her neighbor's house should be monitored by the Building Department 
      because there is a lot of illegal construction going on.


 
(+) Ahmad (last name 
      unclear) – Representing Project Sponsor




- He has been making many calls, between the planner and the sponsor 
      and the neighbors.




- Displayed a photograph of the subject property.




- He has been working with the planner and agrees with her recommendations.




- The only issue he is not in agreement with is to have a 4-foot 
      side reduction, reduce it to 3 feet.




- The project sponsor has paid the penalties for the illegal construction.




- The square footage of the home is quite small.




(+) Sue Wong – Project Sponsor




- Although her neighbors are describing her as a bad person, she 
      is not.




- She believes that there is bad communication.




- It is impossible for her to move the fence by herself.




- She does admit that she installed an illegal kitchen in the basement 
      because she is supporting her parents that live there.




- She is a business owner so she is a very responsible person.




- She would like the Commission to approve the plans. 




ACTION:
 
Take DR and approve with staff recommendations: 
      1) reduce the two-story horizontal extension from 30 feet to 25 feet so 
      that subject property will not be out of character with the neighborhood; 
      2) increase setback from 3 feet to 4 feet in accordance with the residential 
      design guidelines; 3) eliminate all side-facing windows on the proposed 
      extension to ensure neighbor's privacy; 4) issue a notice of special restrictions 
      so that subject extension will not be used as a separate unit.
 
Add an amendment stated by Commissioner Chinchilla: 
      
Project Sponsor is to complete a site 
      survey to establish the location of the property lines.
 
The project Sponsor is to share this information 
      with the adjacent neighbors.

west
 
side of 23rd Avenue, between Vicente Street and Wawona 
      Street; Lot 003 in Assessor’s Block 2473. Request for a Discretionary Review 
      of Building Permit Application No. 2000/11/13/5509s, proposing to enclose 
      an existing lightwell located on the northern side of an existing single-family 
      dwelling. The proposal also includes an infill under the existing second 
      floor. The proposed alteration occurs within the permitted building envelope 
      in an RH-1 (Residential, House, One-Family) District and a 40-X Height and 
      Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and 
      approve the building permit application as submitted.





       
      




 
SPEAKER(S):


 
(-) Michael Davis – 
      Representing DR Requestor




- Staff recommendation is based on many false premises:
 
the significance of the light source, and the planning policy issues 
      involved.




- The pictures displayed by the planner are misleading.




- In light of the current energy crisis, construction that uses exterior 
      light source should be encouraged rather than be eliminated.




- Issues that were requested in the DR request have not been dealt 
      with.


-The Residential Design Guidelines were not followed.


-There are a number of false issues related to permits and non-permitted 
      construction.




- The project sponsor has implied that this is new construction when 
      it really is not.




(-) Stan DeBella – Owner of adjacent property




- He displayed photographs, which were displayed by the planner and 
      explained that the window that is on the lightwell is providing most of 
      the light in the bathroom.




- The dining room window is brightly lit and that all the other detail 
      is being washed out.
 
This is the 
      only significant light source.




- There is a window in the dining room which is facing east but the 
      next house is blocking it.




- The sponsor proposes to increase his kitchen space at his expense.
 
There are windows that already existed.


 
(+) Joan Ryan – Project 
      Sponsors




- They believe that their project is in compliance with all the codes.




- Mr. DeBella's parking concern has been resolved by the adding of 
      a structural steel beam in their garage level.


This would provide two off-street parking spaces as well as one in 
      their driveway.
 
This would effectively 
      create 3 off-street parking spots.




- Professionals have designed the project.




- Accordingly, their family room downstairs is not a defacto 2
nd
 
      unit.
 
It has been designed in compliance 
      with regulations.




- Their lightwell is not in their property grant deed as an easement 
      for his property line windows or exterior plumbing.




- The dining room window and toilet room window will be affected.
 
Both rooms have other windows, which are larger 
      and operable.




- There are other windows, which will not be affected by the construction.




- Mr. DeBella's copper piping is only accessible by their light well 
      and with a ladder.
 
This work was 
      not done with a permit.
 
Mr. DeBella's 
      toilet room window, which is a property line window, was done without a 
      permit as well.




- They have tried to resolve issues with Mr. DeBella and his family 
      through personal dialogue as well as with the San Francisco Community Board.




- They have also offered compensation for the closing of the dining 
      room window.




- They enjoy living there but the flat has become quite small for 
      their growing family.




- With the enlargement of their kitchen, they realize that they will 
      be impacting their neighbor's house.
 
They 
      are sensitive to this and are willing to compensate their neighbor for this.




(+) John O'Sullivan – Project Sponsor




- They would like the Commission to approve their project since it's 
      in conformance with the Planning Code.




- The property line windows at his neighbor's house are redundant.




- Mr. DeBella asked him for permission to go through his light well 
      and look at the plumbing.
 
He didn't 
      know that the work did not have a permit.




(+) James DeVoy – Project Architect




- There is a letter that he sent to the Planning Department which 
      states that there is no way to verify when the lightwells were constructed.




- The property line windows were completed after his client's lightwell 
      was created.




ACTION:
 
Do not take Discretionary Review 
      and approve project with staff recommendation that a Notice of Special Restrictions 
      will be recorded with the property.
 
The NSR will state that the downstairs addition will not be converted 
      into an illegal separate unit.

Re:
 
25 Rio Way


- There is a DR matter next Thursday and he showed a picture of the property.


This project is located at 25 Rico Way in the Marina District.


Many homes have an  established Marina home style. 


Yet this home does not attempt to keep within the Marina style.
 
It appears to be an  ultra modern  design.


- He lives at 27 Rico Way.
 
There 
      are many homeowners that are concerned about this project.
 


- The owners of 25 Rico Way obtained 15 or 17 homeowners stating that they 
      were in support of the property.
 
But 
      unfortunately, the project sponsor mentioned that he (James Meyers) was 
      in support of the project.
 
So when 
      the rest of the neighbors knew that he was in agreement, they signed the 
      support petition.

Re:
 
Orientation Courses are important 
      to the Department


- She has discovered that many planners have gone through  indoctrination  
      courses yet others have not.


- These orientation courses are very important.


- If a planner has not gone through any orientation courses, they should.
