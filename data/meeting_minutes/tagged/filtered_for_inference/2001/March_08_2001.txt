 - 
Request under Planning Code Section 321 (Office
Development Annual Limit) for a determination of design consistency and Project
Authorization of the proposed office development for a five- and six-story
building, including 285,150 square feet of office space, and 23,040 square feet
of areas for service, mechanical equipment, and common areas, for a total of
308,290 gross square feet. On May 11, 2000, the Planning Commission by
Resolution No. 15055 authorized the design of a building of approximately
302,000 gross square feet on MBS Block 28 and granted a Project Authorization
for 225,004 square feet of office space within that building, (Case No.
2000.329B). This application is for the Planning Commission to consider a
Project Authorization that would increase the approved office area by approximately
60,150 square feet, for a total of 285,150 square feet. It would not result in
any design changes.


 
Preliminary
Recommendation: Approval


 


 
SPEAKER(S):


 
(+) Amy Neches – Project Manager –
Redevelopment Agency


 
-
This project involves one full office building and one smaller office building
for consideration.
 
Mission Bay
encompasses 303 acres; it is divided into two redevelopment areas.
 
The two projects consist of 6,000 housing
units, over 6 million sf of office, research and industrial space; nearly 1
million sf of retail as well as a 500 room hotel.
 
This surrounds a 43-acre UCSF campus, which is under development.


 
-
Over 31, 000 permanent jobs will be created as well as 40 acres of new public
parks.
 
The parks will be maintained by
special taxes paid by Catellus Corporation.


 
-
The 6,000 housing units will include 1,700 affordable units.
 
Some of them will be developed by Catellus,
yet most of them will be developed in parcels which are contributed to the
Redevelopment Agency by Catellus for the development of low income housing by
non profit development corporations based in San Francisco.


 
-
The first housing development is already underway.


 
-
Planning is underway for the second development, which will be focused for
senior citizens.


 
-
This project, like all the other Mission Bay projects, has been extensively
reviewed and analyzed.


 
-
The Redevelopment hopes that the Commission will approve this project.


 
(+) Doug Gardner – President of Catellus
Urban Development Group


 
-
They have recently received approval of building permits for these
buildings.
 
The first hundred units have
already begun.


 
-
Mission Bay is a Redevelopment project.


The Redevelopment Commission has taken over 25 actions on Mission Bay
since last Spring.
 
Although they are
here before the Planning Commission because of Prop M authorization, the
decision the Commission makes is quite critical.


 
-
The Gap has already signed a lease for office space.


 
(+) Alison Williams – Partner with AR
Architects


 
-
The primary idea of the building is that it sits in a mid-block 


 
-
The building is a horizontal building


 
-
This building is the only building that has that frontage block.
 
The building has a very simple idea for a
design.


 
-
To the north, the building is very glassy responding to its sunlight
requirement.


 
-
The central bar is of precast concrete with a neutral color.
 


 
-
The glass is all double-glazed clear or double-glazed clear with a horizontal
pattern to help cut down on the glare.


 
-
One of the key features on the building is a very impressive canopy.
 
This provides a daylight illumination.
 
It also helps to soften the parapet line.


 
-
The image of the building is capable of providing night lighting.


 
(+) Stan Smith – Chairperson of the Mission
Bay Citizen's Advisory Committee


 
-
These projects of Mission Bay have gone through many public hearings.
 
There have been many comments – some good
and some bad. 


 
-
The majority of the comments have been positive and he hopes that the
Commission will approve the projects.


 
(+) Jim Chappell – President of SPUR


 
-
There is a tremendous imbalance of both office space and housing.


 
-
This is the reason why SPUR has always supported the Mission Bay projects and
is hopeful that the Commission will approve the project and speed the project
underway.


 
(+) Kevin Beauchamp – Representative of
USCF and Mission Bay Citizen's Advisory Committee


 
-
UCSF would like to express its support for the project.


 
-
The development of UCSF's new campus and the successful realization of Mission
Bay is of great importance to UCSF.


 
(+) Corinne Woods – Vice Chair of the
Mission Bay Citizen's Advisory Committee


 
-
She also lives in Mission Bay.


 
-
They are very much in favor of the project and have looked at the design of the
buildings many times.


 
-
They would really like to have the project approved.


 
(-) Roger Brandon


 
-
The project will be located in a zone that is designated light industrial.


 
-
This area is well suited for industrial and not office.


 
-
This area carries much industrial traffic.


 
-
The City does not need to have a biological campus here.


 
-
This is a poor combination of uses.


 
-
This area should be planned for industrial uses only.

SPEAKER(S):
 


 
(+) Tom McCarthy – Co- President of
McCarthy/Cook and Company


 
-
China Basin is a 689,000 square foot (sf), two building office project located
next to Pac Bell Park.
 


 
-
The project consists of a 480,000 sf wharf side building and a 209,000 sf Berry
Street side building.


- The wharf
side building was built in 1922 as a lumber warehouse and was converted to
office space beginning in the 1970s.
 
It
features an 800 foot long, 33,000 sf award-winning wharf in Mission Creek.
 
The Berry Street building was built in 1992


- There
are many very important companies located in this area.


 
-
In 1998, they filed the initial application for office space under Prop M.


 
-
In the next two years, they met with various companies, organizations, and
groups regarding the project.


 
-
During these years, they have received various comments, suggestions and ideas.


 
-
This facility more than meets the needs of the expansion and provides the
tenants with a convenient parking alternative.


Yet, there are various choices for public transportation.
 
The Third Street Light Rail project is
underway and there is a shuttle service available at China Basin.


 
-
The project includes 62 residential units including 6 affordable units.


 
-
The proposed expansion of China Basin Landing is the correct project.


 
-
China Basin sits at the gateway of Mission Bay.


 
-
They have secured all construction financing.


 
(+) Rodney Friedman – Fisher Friedman
Associates


 
-
He has been in practice since 1956.
 
The
first mixed use project in North America was the Golden Gateway project and his
company worked on it.


 
-
He has received many awards for his project at the wharf.


 
-
China Basin is almost 3 blocks long.


 
-
He made several references to a model displayed at the hearing.


 
(+) Dan Howard – Fisher Friedman Associates


 
-
Working with City staff and neighbors such as Mission Housing, they moved to a
mixed-use project by introducing 62 residential units including 6
affordable.
 
This housing is over and
above the in lieu-housing fee for the housing portion.


 
-
It was a challenge to be able to come up with this design.


 
-
The streetscape and the landscape will be softer and more pedestrian friendly
because of under grounding of the Berry Street utility lines.


 
-
This is the basis for the best urban design and the best City living.


 
-
This is the right project at the right time.


This project provides housing now at the right site.


 
(+) Terry Fancher – Payne Weber Real Estate


 
-
Their firm has had hundreds of employees in San Francisco for decades.


 
-
They made an investment in China Basin recently.


 
-
They are very pleased and very proud to be able to bring housing along with
office at a wonderful location.


 
-
They are substantial owners of various properties in the Bay Area.
 
They hope to bring companies from Silicon
Valley to the San Francisco area.


 
(+) Sue Hestor


 
-
She was the attorney working with the community organization of the
ballpark.
 
One of the things she noticed
with the community surrounding the ballpark was that they had various issues:
 
access to the waterfront and adding housing.


 
-
She worked with housing developers and there were a lot of issues with housing
along the bay.
 
Have these issues been
resolved?
 
Yes.


 
-
The one thing she does not agreement with in the staff report is the zoning of
this area.


 
-
When the commission has problems with solving problems with parking in this
area it is because of the rezoning.
 
The
parking requirements are out of date.


 
-
She would like the Commission to step back and look at the parking requirements
and the rezoning of the area.


 
-
185 Berry is a much better project.


 
(+) Kim Jackson – Hotel and Restaurant
Employees Union Local 2


 
-
She urges the Commission to place their award to 185 Berry Street instead of
801 Market Street.


 
-
Housing is a priority of this commission.


We need housing now.


 
-
This project will meet the priority of this Commission and this City.


 
-
This is the kind of development we need in this City.


 
(+) Pete Goldsmith – President of GCI


 
-
He has been a tenant of China Basin for 10 years.


 
-
He believes that China Basin has been at the front of renovating this area.


 
-
He hopes that the Commission will approve the expansion of this project.


 
(+) Richard Mulkerrins – Able Maintenance
Company


 
-
His company has been established in San Francisco since 1926.


 
-
He supports the expansion of China Basin.


The additional space will create more jobs as well as more housing.


 
(+) David Snyder –
President of the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition


 
-
He has been working with this project for a long time.
 
The project is a good one and is good for
transportation.

They have a resolution drafted to remove the gates.
 
This would be the one and only opportunity to remove the gates.


 
-
The BCDC permit allows them to have gates there restricting access.
 
With this project this would become open
space for Mission Bay, South Beach and for all San Franciscans.
 
It comes into compliance with the open space
requirements of BCDC.
 
Their permit is
outdated since it was done in 1976.
 


 
-
The developer is willing to work with them.


 
-
This project goes a long way in creating affordable inclusionary units in the
Mission Bay Area, which are desperately needed.


 
-
This project is located near the China Basin Landing ferry terminal, it is
located a block away from the Cal Train station and a block away from MUNI; the
transportation aspect is excellent.

Francisco.


 
-
Everyone is ready to begin construction pending the approval of the Commission.


 
-
His company is 100% union and has been since unions were organized in San
Francisco.


 
-
This project has certainty of budget and certainty of financing.

the north side of Jessie street between Fourth and Fifth Streets
.


 
Preliminary
Recommendation:
 
Approval


 
(Continued
from Regular Meeting of March 1, 2001)


 


 
SPEAKER
(S):


 
(+) Tim Tosta – Attorney for Pacific
Resources PCX


 
-
The Pan family, owners and developers of the property, has owned this property
since 1996.


 
-
555 Mission Street has received staff approval yet it's been asked to take some
type of modification to taper its tower.


At the full size it's about 100,000 square feet (sf) of additional bulk,
at the reduced 499,000 sf, it's about 63,000 sf of additional bulk.
 
There is room for one of the other buildings
to be approved if there is a tapering to bring them into alignment.


 
-
These buildings ultimately will be approved because they (project team) have
generally learned to conform over time with the goals and standards of the
Planning Code and General Plan.


 
-
There is a correction on the report since it states that the building has a
rating of good/excellent on use, yet it should be excellent.


 
-
In the projects that are competing with one another, is there an advantage of
one over the other with respect to its marketability?
 
Is it a proven product in its current location or is it a
speculative venture in a new location?


 
-
Is the developer and is the project in a position to be financed immediately?


 
-
Is the developer establishing a track record or can it provide the bonifides
that it can produce the building on time?


 
-
This project, with the Pan family, has established a track record of exemplary
development in San Francisco.


 
-
This building is the only building of the three with no suggested modifications
because the Pan family knows its property so well that they are proposing a
project to the Commission, which is on target, the financing is in place, etc.


 
-
The cash flow generated from Pacific One and Pacific Two can fund Pacific Three
even if its not occupied.


 
-
Pacific Three deserved higher ratings.


 
-
The Pan family has been in the South of Market for the past 6 years.
 
When they developed the project; they did so
considering their specific neighborhood.


This particular project acquires its TDR's from Saint Patrick's Church,
which will allow the seismic retrofit of the church.


 
-
There is a contribution to childcare, which will go to the SOMA Child Care
facility, which was recently displaced from its location.


 
-
This project will also assist City College to relocate its Educated Palace
restaurant from the basement to street level.


 
-
The neighborhood sees this as a welcome addition.
 
The building contributes to the vitality of the new Jesse Street
location.


 
-
The principal tenant of Pacific Place will be Macy's.


 
(+) Jeff Lance – Manager of Pacific
Resource PCX


 
-
The project is in a difficult location.


 
-
Creating more door entries/doorways would create a more open space look.


 
-
$1 million of additional moneys for escrow fees.
 
Their housing fees are higher than 185 Berry Street.
 
The 1.5 million will go to the housing fund,
to the traditional non-profit development for low-income housing.


 
-
There will be no pre-leasing requirements.


 
(+) Judith Baker – South of Market Child
Care, Inc.


 
-
The developer has agreed to fees of relocating the childcare to 8
th

and Howard Streets.


 
-
Read a letter from a parent in support of the development since they will
receive assistance for their relocation.


 
(-) Sue Hestor – San Franciscans for a
Reasonable Growth and Local 2


 
-
The issues with this project are that the people who surround the project are
against the development.


 
-
Cole/Fox hardware will go out of business if this office development is
approved.


 
-
The neighbors of this site will be driven out of business or make it difficult
for them to operate.


 
-
This development will hurt the neighborhood.


 
(+) Tom McCann – Local 38 – Plumbers Union


 
-
He supports the project because it's 100% union.
 
It will create many union jobs.


 
-
He urges the Commission to support this project.


 
(+) Bayardo Chamorro – Owner - Pribuss
Engineers, Inc. (minority business)


 
-
This project will provide jobs for the union labor force.


 
-
He urges the commission to support this project to keep union construction
labor active in the City.


 
(+) Anita Hill – Executive Director of the
Yerba Buena Alliance representing the Yerba Buena Gardens neighborhood.


 
-
She is here to support this project and to endorse it.


 
-
From the point of view of urban infill, everything is right about this project.


 
-
One of the delights of the south of Market is the big blocks and the smaller
alleys.
 
These will be improved with
this project.


 
-
The Union Square Association, the Market Street Association, Monsignor Batanga
and Monsignor Virgil of St. Patrick's Church support and endorse this project.


 
(+) Peter Roger – Superintendent of Plant
Construction


 
-
He supports Pacific Resources and this proposal.


 
-
He is a third generation San Franciscan.


 
-
They are absolutely committed that their project is the better one.


 
-
His association with Pacific Resources has been nothing but positive.


 
-
It is an attractive design and will continue to revitalize the fourth street
corridor.


 
(+) Steven Glick – Dean of the Downtown
Campus for City College of San Francisco


 
-
He has worked in this area for over 7 years.


 
-
This project will allow Pacific Resources to finish the construction of
building 3 and improve the area considerably.


 
-
This project will also help City College improve their downtown campus and
bring the restaurant that is currently located in the basement up to the first
floor and provide their students with a  real world  environment.
 
On the space vacated by the restaurant they
will build a center for advanced technology, which would train students in the
jobs of the future.


 
-
They will also be opening the center on Sundays.


 
-
For these reasons, he urges the Commission to approve the project.


 
(+) Jan Casey – Art Advisor for Pacific
Resources


 
-
She has worked on several large projects in the City.


 
-
They have gone to the community and have chosen various types of art to be
displayed at this site.


 
-
Pacific Resources has done a lot to enforce art in the community.


 
(+) Philip Garcia – Division Manager of
City Park – Teamsters Local 665


 
-
He recommends that the project be approved.


 
-
As a parking operator he has seen the improvements of the 4
th
 and
Market streets.


 
-
Having reviewed the plans of this proposal he is quite impressed with the
project.


 
-
The seismic retrofitting of St. Patrick's church is great. 


 
(+) Jerry Lowrey – Chief Engineer of
Pacific Place PCX


 
-
He has been a local 39 Stationary Engineer member since 1986.
 
He was born and raised in San Francisco.


 
-
This project will be a very needed addition to the area to complete the
renovation between Union Square and Yerba Buena.


 
-
This would be the last piece to complete this project.


 
-
Pacific Resources were kind enough to send him to energy classes.
 
They have asked for his opinion on energy
efficient products and systems.


 
(+) James Hom – Local 22 - Carpenters Union


 
-
He has been a member of the union for 21 years.


 
-
He urges the Commission to approve this project.


 
-
Not only is Pacific Resources union friendly but they are also a very good
developer to work with since they are very friendly and work with the union.


 
(+) Dave Holguin – Local 22 – Carpenters
Union


 
-
He has been a member of this union for 23 years.


 
-
Pacific Resources has been a very good company to work with and would like to
speak on their behalf.


 
(+) Victor Esposto – Cupertino Electric


 
-
He has been a member of Local Union 6 for the past 15 years.


 
-
He has had the privilege to work for Pacific 1 and 2.


 
-
Pacific Resources has been very good to their employees.


 
(+) Fred Bianucci – Cupertino Electric


 
-
He has worked in San Francisco for more than 30 years.


 
-
He has worked specifically with Pacific Resources in several of their projects.


 
-
Many of the projects have brought tourist dollars to San Francisco.


 
(-) Mike Casey – President of Hotel and
Restaurant Workers, Local 2


 
-
He would advise the community organizations to get the money up front.


 
-
Four years ago, their union was in front of the Commission because of the
Palomar Hotel.
 
As a result of that the
conditional use language which was ultimately adopted including language that
said:  project sponsor agrees that the hotel operations will be subject to any
city card check neutrality legislation which becomes effective on or before
March 17, 1998.
 
This legislation was
passed in January of 1998.


 
-
When he went to the operator, Mr. Latour and asked him about signing a card
check neutrality agreement, he said he didn't have to do that and that the person
to go to was the developer.
 
He went to
the developer and they denied that there was any such agreement.


 
-
The language is very clear.
 
They knew
that there would be no proprietary interest.


 
-
This company has violated their word to the City and to the Hotel and
Restaurant Workers.


 
-
He would suggest that the other projects be union as well. 


 
-
Because this company has acted dishonorably and should not be rewarded.


 
(+) Carmen Johnson – Executive Director of
the Agape Outreach Center 


 
-
This center is a community based, non-profit organization, which was organized
specifically for preserving low and moderate-income housing.


 
-
In discussion with the Redevelopment Agency and a private owner to sell a site
on 3
rd
 Street, Agape is in negotiations to develop low income
housing for ownership.


 
-
The infusion of an additional $1 million from 801 Market and Pacific Resource
will significantly reduce the per unit costs and enhance the affordability of
these units.


 
-
Please support and approve this project.


 
(+) Rev. Arnold Townsend


 
-
One of the things heard in San Francisco is market rate housing and affordable
housing.


 
-
Many people have just given up and low-income housing is not heard of anymore.


 
-
Many people are leaving San Francisco and going to other parts of the bay area.


 
-
801 Market has agreed to give $1 million to the housing fund and would help out
the Agape center.
 
This would
significantly change what people have to pay to get into this type of housing.


 
-
It's time for this Commission to approve high-rise housing.


 
-
This project should be approved quickly and with all speed.


 
(+) Craig Allison –
Co-Owner of Plant Construction Company


 
-
They have been in business for 54 years and are a local San Francisco business.


 
-
He would like to talk about trustworthiness of the developer.


 
-
His company stared working on the Pacific buildings with just a handshake.
 
He has never had any problems with this
developer.


 
(-) Jeffrey Leivobitz 


 
-
Regarding public open space, 101 Second is a magnificent building in this
City.
 
It has a grand open space.
 
Yet it's just a lobby.
 
It is not an open space.
 
The proposed construction will have a grand
open space.


 
-
It is an important issue to stop counting lobbies and start counting open
spaces.


 
-
He has worked for several contractors in the City.


 
(-) Bill Barns


 
-
The Supervisor in District 6 has been working on this open space issue.


 
-
185 Berry has a lot of open space yet this proposal is for indoor open space.


 
-
The Park and Rec's priority is to improve parks in the City.


 
-
This project is not going to provide open space.

STREET
 - west side between Sacramento and Clay Streets, Lot 005 in
Assessor’s Block 1004.
 
Request for
Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application No. 2000/11/20/6273,
originally proposing to construct a 22-foot horizontal addition at the rear on
all four levels of the four-story, single-family house.
 
The proposal has since been revised to
construct a 19-foot horizontal addition at the rear, with the fourth level to
be set back six feet from the north side property line. The south exterior wall
between the stairs and garage is proposed to be expanded by four feet and the
garage door will be widened to 12 feet in an RH-2 (Residential, House,
Two-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
 


 
Preliminary
recommendation:
 
Do not take
discretionary review and approve the application as revised.

Note:
 
DR requestor was not able to attend the
hearing.


 
(+) David Tiers – Project Sponsor


 
-
The presentation and the report don't give a history of how this project came
about.


 
-
He had previous discussions with the neighbors and was sure he had a  green
light  on the project.
 
He also felt he
had a  green light  from the planners at the Planning Department counter and
many of the planners involved in the project.


So he felt confident not to take advantage of a project review.


 
-
The neighbor to the north side filed a DR.


All of the negotiation attempts failed.


So they sent a response to the DR.


 
-
At the  11
th
 hour  he received an apologetic call that there would
have to be some reductions made to the plans.


 
-
They were in such a hurry to meet the calendar, that they made some hasty
reductions.


 
-
He would like to give the DR requestor, a 3-foot setback on the top floor and a
6-foot setback on the side that is 90% of what he wanted but would like to have
back the 3 feet he gave on the main mass.

DR and approve plans as modified

TURK STREET
 - between Broderick and Baker Streets, Lot 030 in Assessor's
Block 1152. Request for Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application
No.2000/09/22/1305, proposing to construct a second-floor deck, spiral stairway
and firewall at the rear, southwest corner of the existing building.
 
The proposed addition occurs within the
permitted building envelope in an RM-1 (Residential, Mixed, Low Density)
District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


 
Preliminary
Recommendation:
 
Do not take
Discretionary Review and approve the project as submitted.


 


 
SPEAKER(S):


 
(-) John Flynn – DR Requestor


 
-
He doesn't agree with staff recommendations.


 
-
He is concerned with the early and mid-morning blocking of sunlight and air
with the proposed firewall.


 
-
The analysis states that there will be no sun blockage.
 
It reported afternoon sunlight.


 
-
He displayed photographs of how the proposed addition would block sunlight to
the interior of his home.


 
-
He made some proposals.
 
Instead of
having the project on the west side, relocate the door, which is coming out of
their sunroom.
 
This would not block the
sunlight.
 
They have offered the sponsor
$1,000 to have this done.
 
Another
suggestion was to create safety glass for the firewall in order to get sunlight
coming through.


 
(-) Tomoko Flynn


 
-
The person to analyze the situation did not come to their home for an
inspection.


 
-
Their kitchen eating area is the most important part of their house.
 
They really enjoy the light that comes
through.


 
-
She would like the Commission to reconsider this situation. 


 
(+) Ronda Lyle - Architect


 
-
She respects the DR requestor's concerns about the light.
 
They have tried to address it.


 
-
She is concerned that her client be able to fully enjoy his property.
 
Currently he has no access to the rear yard
since there is no direct access.
 
She is
trying to address this.


 
-
When she started looking at various solutions to this problem, she looked at
various locations.
 
As Glenn mentioned
the east side is not appropriate because of an existing subterranean stair,
which would be very difficult to relocate.


The south side, which Mr. Flynn suggested, poses a lot of problems as
well.
 
The sunroom becomes unusable
since the space becomes transitionary.


It reduces the functionality of the deck area and patio area at grade
level.


 
-
They have tried various changes: make the deck smaller; use a spiral stair
versus a traditional stair in order to reduce the scale of the project.
 
They were thinking of the neighbors when
designing this.


 
-
They proposed to relocate the firewall on their property as opposed to putting
it on the property line.
 
This would
give an additional 6 to 8 inches of more light.


 
-
They would propose that the Commission approve the plans as proposed.


 
(+) Carie Johnson – Co-owner and Project
Sponsor


 
-
He owns the property with his brother.


He lives in the upstairs unit.


 
-
John's proposal that the deck be built on the south side--they never really
considered this because his brother felt it would diminish his light.


 
-
He suggested that the firewall be painted white to reflect more light.

Do
not take DR and approve project as submitted

CASTRO STREET
 - 
west side of the street between
19th and 20th Streets, Lot 003 in Assessor's Block 2696, request for
Discretionary Review of BPA No. 2000/07/26/6145 proposing to merge units three
and two in order to reduce the number of dwelling units in the building from
three to two, in an RH‑3 (Residential, House, Three‑Family) District
and a 40‑X Height and Bulk District.


 
Preliminary
Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and disapprove the project.


 


 
SPEAKER
(S):


 
(+) Gayle Ng


 
-
She and her husband have owned and lived at this address since 1987.


 
-
This project is very important for her and her family.


 
-
In October 1999 they began a 3-phase project to make a home for her mother with
them.
 
In July of last year they
submitted their third phase.
 
They had
completed neighbor notification without any issues when they were told that new
procedures had been implemented.


 
-
Coming here to talk about personal issues is very embarrassing for her and her
family.


 
-
She owes her mother the best care and support since her mother provided for
her.


 
-
Her request is that the Commission allows for an interior staircase in order to
be closer and provide for her mother's needs and not have to go outside and
then inside her mother's apartment.


 
-
She would like to have the Commission approve their request.


 
(+) Michael Vani


 
-
When the building was created there was no direct access to the downstairs
apartment.


 
-
An internal stairwell would allow for them to access the back yard as well.


 
-
If these units were united some how it would allow for Gayle to hear her mother
if she were ever in need for help.


 
(+) William Pashalinski


 
-
Their intent is not to merge units.


Their desire is just to have access to the other unit and care for
Gayle's mother's needs.


 
-
In order to keep the 3-unit building and still construct the staircase, they
would have to keep the kitchen.


 
(+) Joe Chavez


 
-
He has lived in the neighborhood for 40 years and agrees with everything that
everyone has said.


 
-
He would like the Commission to approve this project.


 
(+) (First name unclear)
Swartz


 
-
He is a neighbor and likes Gayle and her family.


 
-
He would also like the Commission to approve this project.


 


 
ACTION:
 
Take
Discretionary review and modify project to include staircase and keep the
kitchen.
