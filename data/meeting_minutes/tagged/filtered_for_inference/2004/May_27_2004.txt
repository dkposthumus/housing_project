B. COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
7. Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner Sue Lee:


Re: Process Question 


- Many times when a Discretionary Review is brought before them the DR requestor has issues that are not always the same as the issues that Commissioners have.


- Regarding cases that have been withdrawn, are these projects going forward?  Are they being dropped?  What does the Department do when a DR project is withdrawn but the project has not accommodated the requests from the Department regarding modifications?  How is this tracked? 


Acting Director Badiner responded:


- Regarding Lurmont Terrace, the project has been withdrawn and will be reconfigured as an alteration.  The Department will take a fresh look at it when it is resubmitted.  If there is a project that the Department has brought before the Commission, staff will take into account the Commission's concerns.


Acting Zoning Administrator Jim Nixon responded:


- On a case that is withdrawn/re-submitted, when staff is aware that the Commission is concerned about certain issues and staff sees those evidence of those issues in the (new) plans, staff would still bring the project before the Commission.


- The Commission can also request a Discretionary Review on any project.


Commissioner Antonini:


Re:  Cell Phone Installation for 2599 Lombard Street


- When a cell phone installation comes before the Commission and the emissions are below the standards, what the Commission decides upon is the information they are provided.


- The only way that the Commission would be able to change the way things are addressed would be if there were any appraisals in terms of the coverage and capacity.


- The Commission is taking the information as valid representations.


Commissioner Bradford Bell:


- She asked that the meeting today be held in memory of Annie Powell who was killed in the Bay View District.


- When people have asked her why she does what she does, she was never able to articulate it until today.  She does what she does so that people like Annie are able to have a future.


- Today's meeting is going to be about humanity, positive forward movement, and cooperation.

8. Director's Announcements


- Welcomed Jim Nixon back to the hearing.


Re:  Upcoming Issues


- The Mayor will release the budget on June 1, 2004.


- The fee ordinance will be heard on Thursday, June 3, 2004.


Re:  Commissioner Antonini's comment:


- Commissioner Antonini is correct.


- Planners don't have the ability to know if the information submitted to them is correct--they are not wireless engineers.  The battles over antennas are being fought about health issues more than anything else.


- It becomes a planning issue as a substitute for what they can talk about.


- Unless the Planning Department hires wireless engineers, planers will continue to struggle with whether an antenna installation is necessary or desirable.


- Maybe this needs to be dealt with at a federal level.

9. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals


BOS - 


Re: Special Planning Audit Committee


- He attended this hearing last Friday.


- It was mostly a positive discussion.


- The most important thing was that towards the end, Supervisor Peskin brought up the management structure of the department.


- The issue about this was actually about how many senior planners there are, etc.


- Sup. Peskin expressed that the senior management level was too heavy.


- This will be an ongoing discussion this budget year.


- He believes that the senior management level is good.  There are good people at that level.


Re:  Special Finance Committee


1) 
Release of funds for the Eastern Neighborhoods


- There was $127,000 still on reserve for the Eastern Neighborhoods environmental review.  Staff has not been able to continue with this environmental review because only a quarter of the funds had been released.  The remaining amount was finally released.


2) 
Supplemental to cover salaries for the past year.
  The fee ordnance was pulled for legal reasons but the budget is based on those fees, which means that salaries based on those projected fees and approved budget still need to be covered.  This item was pulled to do more research on it.


3) 
690 Market Street
 - the Mills Act contract was being reviewed when he left the meeting.  The Board did not take final action and continued the item.


BOA - None

Appeal of Preliminary Negative Declaration
 The proposed project is new construction of 69 residential units in a nine-story, 85-foot tall, approximately 92,900 gross square-foot building covering a 10,313 square-foot site.  A public parking lot currently occupies the project site, which would be demolished.   Up to 62 parking spaces would be located in a basement-parking garage with parking entrances/exits on Shipley Street.  There would be up to 5,000 sq. ft. of ground floor retail space on Folsom Street.  Pedestrian access would be on Shipley and Folsom Streets.  The proposed project requires Conditional Use authorization, a rear yard modification and a variance from dwelling unit exposure requirements.  The site is within a South of Market Residential/Service District (RSD) and a 40-X/85-B Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation:  Uphold the Preliminary Negative Declaration

SPEAKER(S):


(-) Ed Tansen - Appellant - Yerba Buena Lofts Homeowners Association


- He is the developer of Yerba Buena Lofts.


- They have two objections to the Negative Declaration:  1) a two story underground garage cannot be justified at this location because it is too risky for his building; and 2) if excavation is done near the steel piles of his building, there is no way to support them properly.


- No one is going to take that risk at any price.


- If the number of units are cut, there would not be a need for a two story garage.


- This project needs to comply with the California Building Code.  His property determined the property line first.


- If there is an earthquake, the two buildings would bang on each other.


- The environmental group is strictly concerned with the San Francisco Building Code but both codes apply.


(+) Steve Atkinson - Steefel, Levitt and Weiss


- As the staff report notes, the issues of the negative appeal are not environmental issues under CEQA.


- Regarding traffic or shadows, the appellant has not issued information on significant impacts.


- The only reason for this appeal is to delay the project.


- If the Commission follows the recommendation and upholds the negative declaration, then the major issue like the setbacks can be addressed.


- He believes that through the submittals from the project sponsor, the public and this presentation, the Commission will have all the information it needs to make a decision on this project. 


(-) Roger Hall - Clara Street Town Homes Homeowners Association


- He urged the Commission to follow the policies, which apply to setbacks, etc.


- People take pride in their yards.


- The area will be very concentrated and an eye sore to the area.


(-) Brian Fujikawa - Yerba Buena Lofts


- He lives on Folsom Street.


- He is concerned with the large excavation.


- The developers have not responded to the reports submitted regarding engineering and geology.


- There are a lot of questions that still need to be answered.

Request for Conditional Use authorization
 under Planning Code Sections 207.5, 263.11, 271, and 157 to construct a nine-story, mixed-use building with up to 69 dwelling units at a density of one unit per 147 square feet of lot area under Section 207.5, to construct an 85-foot-tall building (with a 16-foot-tall mechanical penthouse) in the 40-X/85-B Height and Bulk District under Section 263.11, to exceed the bulk limits at the 50-foot height by 60 feet in length and 54 feet diagonally (by 48 feet in length and 42 feet diagonally at the 65-foot height) under Section 271; and to provide parking exceeding accessory amounts (with up to 62 spaces for project residents) under Section 157.  On the ground floor, garage access would be provided at Shipley Street, and up to 5,000 gross square feet of retail space would be provided with access from Folsom Street.

(+) Steve Atkinson


- The project is on a narrow and deep vacant lot.


- He displayed an aerial photo from Shipley Street.

(-) Roger Hall


- The egress from the parking garage is right across the street from Silvercrest Residence with studio units for seniors.

(-) Beau Simon - Yerba Buena Lofts


- He lives in the Yerba Buena lofts.

 - 
south side between 4th and 5th Streets, a through lot to Shipley Street; Lot 091 in Assessor's Block 3752 - 
Requests for Variances.
 The proposal is to construct a nine-story, mixed-use building with up to 69 dwelling units, up to 5,000 gross square feet of ground floor commercial space and a 62-space parking garage.  A rear yard modification is sought under Section 134(e) to provide rear yard open space within an inner court and on a 7th floor setback of 10-15 feet along Shipley Street.  A variance is sought from dwelling unit exposure requirements, as the horizontal dimensions of the inner court do not meet the requirements for an open area as defined under Section 140(a)(2) for dwelling unit exposure, and 27 of the 70 units have no exposure other than this inner court.  The site is within an RSD (Residential/Service) Mixed-Use District, and a 40-X/85-B Height and Bulk District.

Preliminary Recommendation:  Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project.


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Barry Brown - Discretionary Review Requestor


- He displayed diagrams of the project showing the shadow impacts during the seasons of the year.


- The property will cast long shadows onto the large bay windows on the west side of the building.


- The bay window currently allows afternoon sunlight and radiant heat into his primary living area during five critical fall and winter months.


- The proposed project to the west will take that away. 


(-) Patrice Motley


- She lives in the other unit of the Discretionary Review requestor.


- It saddens her that they have to be here today.


- From the beginning, they went to the project sponsor to express their concerns.


- There were meetings with the rest of the homeowners association.


- They are trying to peacefully coexist.


- They would like to have the part of the building that has not been built yet pushed back so they can receive some sunlight.


(-) Cristina Wong


- She lives on the opposite side of the building.


- She is not opposed to the construction of the building; she is just concerned about the size of it.


- The light studies that Barry Brown did show how detrimental the project will be.


- She had hoped that everyone could work together.


- A new building will improve the neighborhood.


- She hopes that the architect will consider some of the proposals.


- Her neighborhood association is in agreement with the project.


(+) David Silverman - Representing Project Sponsor


- The height limit in this area is 40 feet but the proposed construction is lower than that.

Mandatory Discretionary Review
 under the Planning Commission's policy requiring review of residential demolition, of Demolition Permit Application No. 2003.06.06.6518, proposing to demolish the existing one-story single-family dwelling in a RH-1 (Residential, House, One-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.

- The city cannot have all the houses be million dollar homes.


- The Commission should deny the demolition.


(-) Father Nazarin 


- He lives on Valley Street next to the proposed house.


- If the purpose of the Commission is to preserve the character of the neighborhood, then they should preserve the house.


- The character has a certain charm.  Trying to build a house with the size that is being proposed would destroy the character.


(-) Jackie Garry


- She has lived next door to the proposed house since 1968.

- The lot can be subdivided and two units created, thereby increasing housing in the city.

- The lot is on a very steep street so the houses step up the hill.


- The proposed houses will be on the top of the hill.


(+) Steve Antenaros - Project Architect


- He displayed a rendering of the proposed houses.


- The upper floors are not visible.


- The design guidelines encourage this type of house.


- Houses can be larger.


(+) Raimond Totah


- He has lived near the proposed house since 1956.


- He will be impacted the most.


- The house is unstable.  That is why the person that lived there moved out.


- If the two poles that are in the garage were taken out, the house would collapse.


- There are a lot of large houses in the neighborhood.


(+) Brian McGee


- He and his family own the property.


- The have had a business in San Francisco for about 40 years.

- The Discretionary Review requestor has tried to sell his house to them.


- The Discretionary Review requestor has been very hostile.


(+) Angus McCarthy - Residential Builders Association


- If people were very passionate against this project they would be here tonight.


- It is unfortunate that it's about 90 percent negotiating and 10 percent building.


- This developer has done a good job designing a project following the Residential Design Guidelines, dealing with neighbor's issues, etc.


(+) Charles Breidinger


- The very top story will not be seen from the sidewalk.


- The houses that are being proposed are truly family housing.


- Parents are moving in with their children and children are moving in with their parents.


- There is a demand for this type of house.


- The children are working downtown and can afford to pay the mortgage.


- Families are joining incomes to pay for mortgages.


(+) Kieran Bukley


- He is in support of the project.


- When it comes to family housing, this would be considered the best example of family housing.


- As far as the top floor, it will not be seen from the street.


- The McGee's do top class work.


(+) Grace Shanahan


- There is high quality craftsmanship in all the projects that the McGee's build.


- This project is no exception.  It would be an ideal family home.

- They have not been able to solve the issues that the Discretionary Review requestor has.


- If the average family has at least two children, houses need to be larger.


- This project is being well executed.


(+) Sean Keighran


- Neighborhood character and good design comes in all shapes and sizes, especially sale prices.


- The people that are opposed to this project are not interested in neighborhood character, but to stop this project instead.


- It is time that communities [accept] the burden of their responsibility for the much-needed housing in San Francisco.


(+) Jim Keith - Residential Builders Association


- There is no place in the planning code that states a building cannot go higher than the neighbor.


- There is nothing in the residential design guidelines that would require taking the top floor off.


- The DR requestor is mistakenly stating that this project should not be demolished.


- Everyone has testified that the McGee's build quality homes.


- He urged the Commission to move this project as proposed.


(+) Joe O'Donaghue


- This is not a monster home.  A four-bedroom home is not a monster home.


- Bigger homes are needed for families.


- There is another new set of values for home needs these days.


- There is no way to see the top floor from the street level.


(-) Tamara Galanter


- She lives on 28
th
 Street.


- She appreciates the developers and has spoken to them about her issues.


- This project is inconsistent with the Residential Design Guidelines which requires that the building be in scale with the adjacent buildings and that it respects the mid block open space.


- She is willing to continue to work with the developers on the issues.


- She requested that the Commission scale down the size of the building.


(+) Mr. Santos - Project Engineer


- The structures that the McGee's build go beyond the requirements of the code [for quality].

G. PUBLIC COMMENT


At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes. 


The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public comment, the commission is limited to: 


(1)  responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or


(2)  requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or 


(3)  directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.  (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))


SPEAKER(S):


Joe O'Donaghue


Re:  Demolitions


- Tomorrow a number of his members will be looking at a piece of property in Oakland.


- Already he is thinking of moving out of this city.


- A member of his organization moved to Burlingame because he was able to purchase a larger house down there.


- The reality is in 1986 when demolition was active in the Richmond, there was no family housing being built.


- The cost of doing "defacto" demolitions is more expensive than doing a complete demolition.


- Demolitions are happening less and less.


- It is important to revisit the demolition ordinance.


Charles Bradiger


Re:  Requiring ground floor retail when there isn't' a market for it.


- He has his office on Howard Street between 7
th
 and 8
th
.  Recently a building was constructed with ground retail that has been vacant for over a year.


- Why is there a requirement for ground floor retail when there is no demand for it.  Windows get broken and vandalism is done to these empty space.


Angus McCarthy


Re:  A market for larger family houses


- He has already outgrown his house because his family is getting bigger.


- Many families cannot purchase bigger homes because there aren't many.


- It is important to allow certain neighborhoods to allow larger homes.


- If people want to purchase a million dollar home they should be allowed to do it.


Shawn Kegran


Re:  Evaluation of having square footage 


- The square footage worries him.  It does not affect his impact as a pedestrian on the street.


- The commission should not pay too much attention to the square footage of a home if it follows the Residential Design Guidelines.


- A candidate to purchase a home can purchase two houses and merge them or he/she can compete with other people who cannot afford a house and rent.


- The housing market is recyclable.


Jim Keith


Re:  Polity on the demolition of residential buildings


- If there is a circumstance when a lot can become a multiple lot and this is not allowed, then this policy is not going to work.


- What people will do is go through the remodeling route and make the houses larger.
