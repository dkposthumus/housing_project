4.  Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner Sue Lee:


Re:  Eastern Neighborhoods


- It was reported to them that money is being released for staff to begin the EIR.


- She  would like to receive periodic updates on the status of the EIR effort and receive a work plan and a timetable.


- The Commission needs to be informed.


- When the policies were adopted in February, the maps were not that legible.  It would be helpful to her to have a large format map of the zoning so that she knows what parcels and what blocks are being referenced.  The large format would be at least 11 x 17 and in color.


- She would like to see a list of projects that are pending since the policies were adopted.


Re:  Status of Budget


- She hopes that the Acting Director will speak on this.


- Also, she would like to see the status of the search for the new Planning Director since we allocated moneys in the budget for this purpose.


Commissioner Antonini:


Re:  Eastern Neighborhoods


- He that staff do exit interviews with PDR firms that have left San Francisco.


- He has a list if staff needs the information.


C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
5. Director's Announcements


Re:  Budget


- The budget was released officially by the Mayor.


- It is a mixed budget for the Planning Department.  It calls for new money to finish environmental reviews that have been lagging.


- It calls for $300,000 for computer operations/equipment.


- It adds five positions to the Planning Department (two new Environmental, two Citywide Planners, and one graphic artist).


- It gives money to hire consultants to do another Better Neighborhoods Program.


- The Mayor requested a 20% cut in support/administrative staff in order to put money into direct services positions opposed to administrative support.  As a result, seven positions have been lost.


- It was one of the hardest things he has had to do as Acting Planning Director.


- Money will be contributed to the support of the City Attorney.


- It calls for about a 14% increase in revenues.


- Regarding the money that was allocated for the Director's search, this was eliminated from the budget.


Commissioner Sue Lee:


- She realizes that Planning is being more appreciated yet there is a lack of understanding that the department needs to be lead.


- She is concerned that there are various projects pending right now for Planning; the Commission is short one member; etc.


- She does not think that support will come from the Mayor's office.


- She is very interested in the Commission participating in the process of hiring a new director as per the Charter.


- She does not know how a search process will begin and not have any funds for it.


Commissioner Bradford Bell:


- It is extremely difficult for the department to face layoffs.


- The choices are to do what is needed to save a few jobs or save the City.  This is a tough job.


- The situation is actually positive even after the layoffs.


- The Director comes back July 1 and at that time, we will schedule a closed meeting to talk to him.  Hopefully, this will happen with what is happening at the Mayor's office.


Commissioner Antonini:


- There is a search underway via the Mayor's office for a Director, but are the funds coming from there rather than from the Planning Department?


- He does not believe that $50,000 is needed for this procedure.


- The openness of the process is more important than the money.


Commissioner Bradford Bell:


- On May 13, the Commission talked about putting a committee of three together to address this.  Is this something that she can initiate?  This might answer Commissioner Antonini's question.


Deputy City Attorney, Susan Cleveland-Knowles responded:


- The issue of putting the committee together can be scheduled.


Commissioner Boyd:


- It is very important to find a leader for the Planning Department.


- The final choice will be made by the Mayor's office after the Commission chooses candidates.


- The Commission needs to be very cooperative and very firm.


- Everyone wants to see the needs of the public related to land use get solved


Acting Director Badiner reported on another matter


- He met with the senior managers of Citywide and is requesting information on finding a procedure to process the plans.  What would the timelines be?  What would be the deliverables, etc.?


- When this information comes in there will be frequent updates to the work plan.


SPEAKER(S):


Joe O'Donaghue - Residential Builders


Re: Processing Permits


- He gets enraged that no one is speaking about processing permits.


- It takes about 6 to 10 weeks before a project is assigned to a planner.


- The Mayor and the Board of Supervisors did not give the current Director his due process.


- There will be a lawsuit filed to block any transfer of funds from the Board of Building Inspection.


- The Planning Department needs to come with a plan and decide where the money is going to go.


- Non one has said that the Planning Director is not getting any pay.  Yet people who have gone on the same program received a salary.  So where is the money that he left?


Commissioner William Lee:


Re:  San Francisco Stat


- He suggested that the Planning Department participate in this system.


Acting Director Badiner Responded:


The Planning Department comes on line for participation in this system next month.

 PLANNING CODE FEE AMENDMENT ARTICLE 3.5, ADMINISTRATIVE CODE SECTION 31.21
.  
Consideration of Resolution of Intent to initiate
 an amendment to Article 3.5 of the Planning Code and Section 31.21 of the Administrative Code.  The purpose of this hearing is to set a future date to hold a public hearing to consider an adjustment and increase in various application fees consistent with the Department's 2004/2005 Fiscal Year Work Program.


Preliminary Recommendation: Approve initiation


SPEAKER(S):


Mary Burns - President of the Greater West Portal Neighborhood Association


- Voting no on raising specific fees for applications for residential character.


- A six-fold increase in the application fee is highly inappropriate and will affect various neighborhoods negatively.


Steve Vettel


- The fee increases proposed is about 316 percent over existing fees.


- The fees that are being proposed for moderate size projects is enormous.


- He does not know where the money is going, the problem is not fees.  The problem is that there are not enough employees to fill positions.


- What is being proposed is not even close to reality.


- He requests that these numbers be looked again before next week.


Joe O'Donoghue


- He echoes the previous speakers comments.


- If the document presented came from a CPA it would make no sense.


- Are the planners really functioning at their best level?


- A General Motors type of accounting system should be taken into consideration.


- Staff needs to assure the public that the fees they are paying are well managed.


ACTION: Hearing Held.  Public Comment Remains Open.

Request for Conditional Use Authorization
 under Planning Code Sections 253 and 271 to allow a building to exceed 40 feet in height in the 65-A Height Bulk District and to exceed the prescribed bulk limit.  Above a height of 40 feet, the A Bulk District allows a maximum building length of 100 feet and a maximum diagonal dimension of 125 feet. The proposal is to demolish the existing three-story commercial building (formerly a television station and most recently a tennis club) and to construct a new six-story, mixed-use building up to 65 feet in height and with a maximum length of 128 feet and a maximum diagonal measurement of 146 feet above a height of 40 feet.  The new building proposes up to 29 dwelling units, 43 parking spaces in a below-grade garage, and approximately 4,700 square feet of commercial space at street level.  A concurrent hearing before the Zoning Administrator will be held for a Variance request.  The subject property is within an RC-3 (Residential-Commercial Combined, Medium Density) District and a 65-A Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation:  Approval with Conditions


(Continued from Regular Meeting of April 22, 2004)


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Bruce Baumann


- This proposal is to demolish the building and replace it with a multistory building.


- There will be two two-bedroom units and one one-bedroom unit that will be below market rate.


- There is a need for family housing so the average size of the units will be very good elements for family housing.


- They have eliminated a driveway so there will only be one curb cut.


- The building will be completely separate on both sides.


- This will be a highly articulated façade.


- There will be a pedestrian based element in order to enhance pedestrian use/environment on the street.


- The adjacent property has a skylight and windows and the proposed project will have setbacks to respect them.


(+) Werner Schmaltz - Project Architect


- He displayed a floor map and explained the general aspects of the project.


(+) Liz Naughton - Project Sponsor


- In August of 2003, they sent letters to all the property owners near the project.


- They met with concerned neighbors and addressed their concerns.


- They also sent information to various community groups.  She has not heard of any comments from these organizations.


(+) Joe O'Donaghue


- He supports the project.  It is very well designed.


(-) Linda Cummins


- She lives near the proposed building.


- Her home will be dwarfed considerably.


- She disagrees with what has been said regarding the design.


- The parking situation is very difficult in this area.


- She is concerned about the loss of sunlight that will affect her home.


- She understands that the City has to grow, but she does not know how affordable these units will be.


ACTION: Approved as Amended:  In the Conditions of Approval, delete item 2.  Item 9, on the Affordable Housing, the below market rate units are two, 2 bedroom; one, 3 bedroom and shall be located one on the second floor, one on the third floor and one on the fourth floor.

Request for Rear Yard and Dwelling Unit Exposure Variances
 under Sections 134 and 140 of the Planning Code.  The proposal is to demolish the existing three-story commercial building and to construct a new six-story, mixed-use building up to 65 feet in height with up to 29 dwelling units, 43 parking spaces in a below-grade garage, and approximately 4,700 square feet of commercial space at street level.  The proposed building measures 122 feet long and 70 feet deep, a rear yard Variance is requested.  A five-foot rear yard is proposed along the western portion of the lot where an 18.75-foot rear yard is required.  A Variance from the exposure requirements is also requested.  Eight units along the west side of the proposed building would not meet the dwelling unit exposure requirement, which requires all dwelling units to face onto either a street or Code-complying rear yard.  The subject property is located in an RC-3 (Residential-Commercial Combined, Medium Density) District and a 65-A Height and Bulk District.

Preliminary Recommendation:  Adoption of the CEQA findings and the Mitigated Negative Declaration


(Continued from Regular Meeting of May 13, 2004)


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Charles Bloszies - Project Architect


- He gave a general description of the project as well as it's historical merit.


(+) Mary Murphy 


- They are here to seek support from the Commission to obtain a Mills Act authorization.


- There are increased costs of various aspects and the Mills Act would help with these costs.


- There is change in the language that she suggested:  take out the language from Page 3, Attachment D that stats: ..."as it exists on May 5, 2004".  This was recommended language from the Landmarks Board.  The deleted language should be replaced with:  "the rehabilitated Garfield Building (including the proposed penthouse addition if constructed)."  The reason for this change is because they would like the Board of Supervisors to have broadest degree of discretion when authorizing the Mills Act contracts.

 for a substantial increase in height as well as the creation of a light well on a Category I Building, The Garfield Building, for the subject property, which is in the C-3-G (Downtown, General) Zoning District, the Kearny-Market-Mason-Sutter Conservation District, and a 110-X Height and Bulk District.


 


The proposal is to:


1) Seismically upgrade the subject seven-story office building (The Garfield Building);


2) Rehabilitate the historic building façades;


3) Construct a one-story vertical penthouse addition that would be set back from both the Market Street and Mason Street facades, and create a light well along the eastern property line;


4) Convert the existing office use to approximately 33 dwelling units;


5) The Project will not provide parking as required by the Planning Code, nor will thirteen of the units meet the technical Planning Code requirements for dwelling unit exposure, and only three of the 33 units will have private open space.  No common space will be provided on the project site, which is completely occupied by existing building.  Given these factors, variances would need to be granted for parking, dwelling unit exposure, and residential open space requirements.


6) The proposed project would provide its required Below Market Rate (BMR) units on site as well as the off-site BMR units required for a proposed companion project located at 690 Market Street (2003.0584MTZXCKLU).


7) The project sponsors are seeking to avail themselves of the Mills Act, which allows local governments to grant property tax relief benefits in exchange for the guaranteed preservation of a historic property.  In order to qualify under the San Francisco Administrative Code, the property must either be designated as a San Francisco Landmark or listed separately on the National Register.  As neither condition is the case with the subject property, the project sponsor is seeking conditional San Francisco landmark status.  The proposed Landmark Designation would become final upon the completion of the proposed project consistent with the Rehabilitation Program set forth by the proposed Mills Act contract.

Request for Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit Application No. 2003.05.29.5746 proposing to construct a new three story dwelling at the front of a lot where a single-family dwelling exists at the rear of the lot.  The property is within an RH-2 (House, Two-family) District, and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.  


Preliminary Recommendation:  Take Discretionary Review and approve the project as modified.

SPEAKER(S):


(-) Nick Russo - Discretionary Review Requestor


- This is the third time that he has had to deal with this issue.


-
 In 1988, a permit was taken out to do the same thing.  He filed a Discretionary Review at that time.  He received a notice to come to City Hall and his request was upheld and the project did not go further.


- In 1999, another permit was taken out.  These plans were rejected.


- The building that exists is not a small cottage.  It is a two story building that totals 2,000 square feet.


(-) Dick Millet - Potrero Boosters


- He is an architect and has been involved in various projects in Potrero Hill.


- This project is a way of extending out an older building.


- The project will be affecting two neighbors.


- The project sponsor will get a lot more money if he does not disturb the neighbors.


- Bay windows should not be allowed either.


(+) Reza Hershemizan - Representing Project Sponsor


- This project will not affect the neighbors.


- If the project had been built by today's code, the project would be a lot larger--especially towards the back.


- He spoke to the neighbors at one of the meetings.


- The length of the building is 33 feet.  If he takes off the top floor, it will not be worth doing.


ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and approved with modifications:  remove the top floor of the proposed house, in part, to mitigate the effect the new dwelling unit would have on the DR Requestor's building.  The Commission finds that this modification is appropriate given the context of the subject block.  


The project entails adding an additional unit in an RH-2 District thereby better utilizing the previously underutilized lot.

RE-OPEN CONSIDERATION OF ADOPTION OF INTERIM RULES FOR THE MISSION IN THE EASTERN NEIGHBORHOODS
: (generally bounded by Potrero Avenue, Cesar Chavez, Guerrero, and Division Streets).
 Public hearing on the adoption of interim policies or a resolution of intent to adopt interim zoning controls
 that would establish areas for Housing and Mixed Use, PDR, and Housing/PDR in the Mission. The Housing and Mixed Use zoning overlay will encourage residential development; the PDR zoning overlay will primarily support production, distribution and repair activities; and the Housing/PDR zoning overlay will promote a mix of residential and other uses while preserving existing PDR space. The initiation of interim zoning controls would require the adoption of a resolution of intent to initiate that will enable the publication of a formal notice for a future public hearing at which hearing the Planning Commission would consider the adoption of interim controls.


NOTE
: On March 25, 2004, Commission President Bradford Bell re-opened the consideration of interim rules for the Mission area of the Eastern Neighborhoods.

E. PUBLIC COMMENT


At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes. 


The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public comment, the commission is limited to: 


(1)  responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or


(2)  requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or 


(3)  directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.  (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))


Janett Craine - Smith and Craine Architects


Re:  212 Union Street


- Her clients have asked them to bring to the attention of the Commission the matter of a recently issued Certificate of Compliance.


- The project restores and saves a much altered old cottage in the Telegraph Historic District.  The project renovates the cottage and has constructed a new cottage.


- By maintaining the scale of the two buildings, preserving the existing cottage and surrounding the space with landscaping, allows for an unusual significant investment.


- The Planning staff have approved all the details of the project except for one:  the treatment of the old cottage's existing front door and access from the Union Street steps.


- The Landmark's Advisory Board approved all the requirements except for the door.


- The Telegraph Hill Homeowner's Association would like to save the door and move it to the level below since the entrance is now from a courtyard.  If the door was moved it would create two front doors which would not be agreeable to the owners.


- She requested that the Commission allow this project to be discussed in a Director's Report.
