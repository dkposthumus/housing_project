TENTH/MARKET/MISSION STREETS MIXED-USE PROJECT (AKA 1401-1435 MARKET STREET)
 - 
Certification of a Final Environmental Impact Report
:  The project site is at Assessor's Block 3507, Lot 39, and is located in the C-3-G (Downtown General Commercial) Zoning District and in the 150-S, 200-S, and 320-S Height and Bulk Districts.  The project site is approximately 95,000 square feet on the west side of Tenth Street between Market and Mission Streets.  The project site is within the proposed Mid-Market Redevelopment Project Area.  The project sponsor proposes to construct a 24-story, 320-foot-tall office building fronting Market Street which would provide municipal offices uses; a 21-story, 200-foot-tall market-rate housing tower fronting Tenth Street which would provide up to 250 units; and a 15-story, 150-foot-tall affordable senior housing tower would provide up to 200 units.  The project would include approximately 313 off-street parking spaces and the total gross square footage for the proposed project would be approximately 1,024,119.  The proposed project would require demolition of seven structures, which contain approximately 166,700 gross-square-feet of vacant office space and removal of 108 surface parking spaces. 


Preliminary Recommendation:  Certify the Final Environmental Impact Report.  Please note that the public review period for the Draft Environmental Impact Report ended at 5:00 pm, June 28, 2004.

7.  Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner Hughes:


Re:  170 St. German


- He commented on a document he received that makes what he believes is a very serious assertion.


- He is not sure if this can be scheduled.


Director Green Responded:


- The Commissioners have the right to make comments on any matter important to them.  


- The matter cannot go into a dialogue by Commissioners unless it is scheduled.


Commissioner W. Lee:


Re:  Status of Planning Director Search


- He is frustrated about reading a newspaper article regarding the Director of Planning as well as a letter sent from Commissioner Bradford Bell directed to Mayor Newsom.  It is also disturbing reading about a project that was done in 2004 where funding was approved for open space and it was not used for open space.


- He feels very strongly that the Commission needs to get moving on this issue.


- He sees three options:  1) terminate the current director; 2) retain him in the position; 3) place his name in the pool of applicants.


- "I have never seen such a dysfunctional department."


- An action item should be placed on the agenda of the next meeting to discuss this issue.


- He requested that Commissioners vote today to determine if this issue should be placed on the agenda as an action item at the next hearing.


- "If Commissioners feel that I am out of line, I am willing to resign from the position of Planning Commissioner."


Commissioner Antonini:


Re:  Status of Planning Director Search


- He questioned if there was going to be a meeting next week (September 30, 2004)?


Commission Secretary responded:


- The 5
th
 meeting of the month has always been cancelled.


Commissioner Antonini:


Re:  Status of Planning Director Search


- He remembers a conversation about a month ago to add it back in.


Commission Secretary responded:


- There was a discussion of having a joint meeting with the Redevelopment Agency Commission, but a quorum was not achieved.


Commissioner Antonini:


Re:  Status of Planning Director Search


- Will the special meeting to discuss the director include discussion on the three options Commissioner Lee mentioned? 


- Would it be a public hearing or a closed session meeting?


Commissioner W. Lee:


Re:  Status of Planning Director Search


- He feels that it would be a two-part meeting; one to discuss the present Director's position and the second part could be to look at other applicants.


- His main concern right now is that the longer this is delayed, the more dysfunctional the Planning Department is as well as their relationship with the Department of Building Inspection.


Commissioner Antonini:


Re:  Status of Planning Director Search


- He would be supportive of a discussion.


Commissioner Bradford Bell:


Re:  Status of Planning Director Search


- She wants to be clear on this issue since there is already scheduled a closed session meeting on October 7 to discuss resumes.


- There is a need for a consensus among the Commission to discuss the position of the current Director.


Commissioner S. Lee:


Re:  Status of Planning Director Search


- She feels that the discussion of the current Director is important but next week does not work for her.


- The Commission has not taken the step to advertise for the position of Director.


Commissioner Olague:


Re:  Status of Planning Director Search


- She would be interested in seeing a search that would be initiated by the Commission.


Commissioner Hughes:


Re:  Status of Planning Director Search


- He feels that an executive session is appropriate.


- The only question is when should that happen in order to have a quorum.


Commissioner W. Lee:


Re:  Status of Planning Director Search


- He feels the frustration that the public and staff are feeling.  The longer the Commission waits, the less manageable staff will be.


- In the next two weeks a decision needs to be made.  That is what he wants to see happen.


Commissioner Bradford Bell:


Re:  Status of Planning Director Search


- What she is understanding is just to add an item for discussion and not an item for a vote on the current Director at the October 7, 2004 closed session hearing.


Commissioner W. Lee:


Re:  Status of Planning Director Search


- If the City Attorney states that a vote can be made than he would like to vote.


Commissioner Hughes:


Re:  Status of Planning Director Search


- His thought is to have a discussion and if possible a vote.


Commissioner Antonini:


Re:  Status of Planning Director Search


- He agrees with Commissioner Hughes.


- Allowing a discussion with a possible vote on the options that Commissioner Lee mentioned would allow the public to get some sort of direction.


Commissioner Bradford Bell:


Re:  Status of Planning Director Search


- She hears consensus that this item should be scheduled for October 7 during closed session:  discussion and possible action on the current director and a discussion on the resumes they have received.


Commissioner W. Lee:


Re:  Status of Planning Director Search


- He thanked everyone for their support and understanding the importance of this issue.


Commissioner Antonini:


Re:  Status of Planning Director Search


- The start time for the closed session will be 12:00 noon?


Commissioner Secretary responded:


Yes, although the start time for the regular hearing will possibly be changed - perhaps 2:00 or 2:30 p.m., etc.


Commissioner S. Lee:


Re:  Status of Planning Director Search


- If there is a possible action on the director then there should be an action on the resumes.


Commissioner Bradford Bell:


Re:  Status of Planning Director Search


- The resumes can be talked about but if there is a discussion about the process then that needs to be talked about at a public session.


Commissioner Olague:


Re:  Status of Planning Director Search


- In the future when there is a discussion on the [current] Planning Director, the decision should be apparent before resumes are collected because the process has been excruciating for everyone.


Re: Various Issues before the Board of Supervisors


- It would be helpful if Jean Paul Samaha would provide weekly reports to the Commission.


Re:  755 22
nd
 Avenue (Discretionary Review)


- She feels that this item came before the Commission very late at last week's hearing.


- She looked again at the report.  She felt that there were certain aspects of the project that she read later that probably could have influenced her vote.  The late hour made it difficult to make a fair decision.


- She is not aware if this could be revisited.


Commissioner Sue Lee:


Re:  755 22
nd
 Avenue (Discretionary Review)


- She asked Commissioner Olague if she is requesting to bring this item back.


Commissioner Olague:


Re:  755 22
nd
 Avenue (Discretionary Review)


- She is requesting to bring this item back and has spoken to the City Attorney on this.


Commissioner Sue Lee:


Re:  755 22
nd
 Avenue (Discretionary Review)


- Just to clarify, when a decision has been made by the Commission, there is no mechanism to revisit or rescind their vote.


Commission Secretary responded:


Re:  755 22
nd
 Avenue (Discretionary Review)


- There is a mechanism for the Commission to rescind their action.  But once the action has been taken and more than a meeting has passed, there is no mechanism the Commission could use to rescind their action.


Deputy City Attorney, Susan Cleveland-Knowles responded:


Re:  755 22
nd
 Avenue (Discretionary Review)


- Similar to 170 St. Germain, if the building permit has not been sent back to the Department of Building Inspection, then the Planning Department or the Planning Commission would still have jurisdiction on the project.


- For 170 St. Germain, there were extreme circumstances.


Commissioner Antonini:


Re:  755 22
nd
 Avenue (Discretionary Review)


- He agrees that an item like this was heard too late in the evening.


- Can the people involved in this case go to the permit appeals?


Zoning Administrator Responded:


Re:  755 22
nd
 Avenue (Discretionary Review)


- The building permit can be appealed by either party or any party.


Commissioner Olague:


Re:  755 22
nd
 Avenue (Discretionary Review)


- She finds sometimes that in the staff report there is a lack of reference to the Residential Design Guidelines.  She finds herself going back and checking the guidelines herself.


Commissioner Bradford Bell:


Re:  Status of Planning Director Search


- She did write the letter to Mayor Newsom.


- Her point on this matter is "crystal clear."


- She agrees with moving forward and having a session on October 7.


- She is reluctant to allow this Commission to be held "hostage" by an old process.  This is an independent body elected half and half by the Board of Supervisors and the Mayor.  When one has the ability to bear pressure on this Commission to force their particular agenda is extremely unhealthy.


- On October 7, there will be some resolution.


C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
8. Director's Announcements


Re:  Items Previously Requested by the Commission


- September 2, Commissioner William Lee requested dates of projects in the Mayor's long-term environmental reports.  The Director submitted in Commissioner's packets a chart of all the major long-range projects and the expected benchmarks for these projects.


Re:  Three priorities over the next few weeks


- 
Housing Element
 - This is a very important document to the Commission and to the residents of San Francisco.  There are major steps ahead to be taken.  All Commissioners have received a letter from the Department of Housing and Community Development of the State of California where they raise some comments about the element.  He, the City Attorney and Mayor's Office will be working very hard to deal with the issues raised.


- 
Eastern Neighborhoods
 - One October 28, the Commission will be conducting a hearing specifically on the Mission District.  He will be sitting down with community groups within the Mission to discuss issues and work up to a larger meeting.  There will be other meetings with Showplace Square and SOMA.


- Department's Functionality - There is a priority to discuss the re-structurization of the department.  There are operating implications that have occurred because of the budget.  There are extreme back logs that need to be addressed.  He will be focusing on this as well.


Re:  Jean-Paul Samaha's presence


- He is usually here to discuss items related to the Commission and the Board of Supervisors.  He is not here today because of other responsibilities.


- The Commissioners should ask him whenever they have concerns or if there are any questions related to issues or policies.


Re:  Status of Planning Director Search


- He asked that the Commission be professional and fair when discussing this issue.


Commissioner Antonini:


- He has a question on the Housing Element being in compliance with the State.  Is staff taking steps to do that?


Director Green Responded:


- The State reviews every housing element, sets goals and implements the State's provisions in regards to what goals and what forecasts should be in the document.


- The goal is to demonstrate that the document that the Commission adopted is in substantial compliance with State requirements.


Commissioner Antonini:


- Is there another deadline for the Housing Element and when should this process begin?


Director Green Responded:


- Staff has not begun the new housing element that has a deadline of 2007 for final adoption and final opinions from the State.


- The focus right now is on getting this document completed.


Commissioner Antonini:


- He would like to be informed on any compromises or meetings with relation to the Eastern Neighborhoods.


Director Green Responded:


- The plan is to have a large meeting in the Mission District.


- It is important to obtain everyone's comments and for staff to provide this information to the Commission.


Commissioner Antonini:


- The restructuring of the department will be planned soon.  He would like to know when this will be presented.


Director Green Responded:


- He would prefer to present this information when there is a full Commission.

Report on SRO Policies


Director Green and Dan Sider gave a presentation on this issue.


SPEAKER(S):


Sue Hestor


- About 10 years ago there were issues about the history of the south of market plan revolving around live/work.  There was a big box of files.  These files should be found.


- Other cities have developed a new type of SROs.


- The rules currently usually apply to rehab.


- The Commission needs more information on this.


- There should be a generic understanding as well.


Charles Bredinger


- There have not been that many SRO projects recently even though there has been an incentive in the Planning Code.


- There are a lot of SROs being built in San Diego, Phoenix, and Las Vegas.


Alice Barkley


- She feels the confusion is that the previous SRO connotation is different from residential hotel.


- These are in high-density neighborhoods.


- All of the new SRO buildings will have elevators, be handicap adaptable, etc.


ACTION: None.  Informational Presentation Only.


D.  CONSENT CALENDAR


All matters listed hereunder constitute a Consent Calendar, are considered to be routine by the Planning Commission, and will be acted upon by a single roll call vote of the Commission.

Request for Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit Application No. 2004.03.01.7434, proposing to raise the existing building two feet to accommodate a new garage in the ground floor and to construct a rear horizontal addition to the existing one-story-over-basement, single-family residence in an RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project.

Request for Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit Application No. 2004.04.08.0828, proposing to convert the existing attic into habitable space and to construct a rear horizontal addition to the existing four-story, two-unit building in an RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project.


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Lock Holmes - Representing Discretionary Review Requestor


- One of the concerns is that this project is too large.


- The mid-block open space is not respected.


- The proposed project would cut into the rear yard quite a bit.


- There is no basis for an exception.


(-) David Thompson - Discretionary Review Requestor


- The owners on this street feel that the project as presented is not adequate.


- Parking is also an issue with this project.


- It is important to analyze the regulations.


(-) Welton Rotz


- The developer has been speaking for about a year.


- They found out that it is not permissible to build a "bump out."


- They would accept a 12-foot bump out with a 5-foot set back on each side.


(-) Bill Higgins


- The code only allows a 12-foot pop out and the project sponsor wants to build an 18-foot pop out.


- He displayed diagrams to show the extent of the pop out.


(-) Barry Bone 


- He has lived on Filbert for 30 years.


- He has parked on the street all that time.


- When he was shown the plans, he was concerned about the parking in the neighborhood.


- Neighbors will be circling the block endlessly looking for parking.


(+) Joe Sherer - Builder


- He believes that they have followed the rules.


- The project will be within the 40-foot height allowed.


- Parking will be for two cars.


- He would welcome the ability to widen the garage door.


(+) Mary Grudnowski - Project Sponsor


- This has always been a building that has two addresses even though there has always been one owner.


- Through the course of the year, her representative has met with the neighbors to discuss thoroughly the project.


(+) Jeremy Nelsen - Transportation for a Livable City

Preliminary Recommendation:  Take Discretionary Review and approve the project with conditions.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of September 2, 2004)


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Steve Vettel - Morrison and Forrester


- This project's Negative Declaration was before the Planning Commission in June of 2004 and the Commission unanimously upheld it.


- The Board of Supervisors upheld the Commission's decision on this project.


- This project does comply with the core PDR policies.


- These are some light industrial artist's spaces.


- They have adequate parking and amenities.


- He recommends that the Commission do not take Discretionary Review unless it's to specify that these spaces will not be used as offices.


(-) Jilllen Doroan


- She is an artist.


- She has worked for many years to promote art space.


- She supports arts development in San Francisco.


- The proposed project as currently designed does not contribute to the neighborhood and is not responsible development.


- There are numerous non-cost productive ways to improve the design.


(+/-) Kellie Seringer


- This is a good project concept yet it does not respond to the content of the neighborhood.


- The building resembles a penitentiary.  It just looks like a box on a lot.


(-) Heidi Sokolowsky


- She is a designer and an architect.


- The project does not really respond to the street.


- They welcome the use but are concerned about the massing.


(-) Ian Green


- This building does not speak to the Arts Component because there are no controls on how much these spaces will rent for.


- He has a real concern about the scale, the massing and the lack of articulation in this building.


(-) Ron Slayen


- His job causes him to make a lot of noise.


- He knows that the noise the project will render will not bother him or the neighbors.


- He is concerned about the size and massing of the project.


- The exterior of this project should be changed.


(+/-) Kathleen Diop


- The units of this project are very small.

- This project will allow people to have work spaces.


- She hopes that she will be moving back to San Francisco soon.


(+/-) Oscar Grande - MAC


- They have met with the developer many times.


- They are concerned about the retention of PDR.  This is not a perfect project but it's on its way to being a perfect project.


- They are concerned that the Latino Immigrant Community will have limited access to the units.


- What this building provides, the community can use.


(+) Mike Sagalovitch


- He is glad that MAC has concerns that this is not PDR.


- He is concerned about the size and mass of the building.


- There is also no ventilation in the building and this is very important.


(+) Richard Stacey


- He spoke about the architectural aspects of the project.


(+) Jeremy Nelson - Transportation for a Livable City


- The project sponsor provided a transportation study.  This should be required by all projects.


- They like the fact that there are bike spaces.


- The parking is upgraded and interior.  There is no row of parking slots in the front.


- There should be a stronger pedestrian realm.


(+) Gary Romain - Project Sponsor


- This project provides an opportunity to accommodate different uses over different times.


ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and approve the project with the following recommendations:  adopt design changes for the Treat Avenue facade that were presented by staff.

Request for Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit Application No. 2002.12.09.3124, proposing to alter a single-family dwelling by adding an approximately 30 foot deep, two-story addition to the rear of a three-story, single-family dwelling, in an RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District. 


Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project.


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Madeline E. Otsea - Discretionary Review Requestor


- She and her husband purchased their property in 1959.


- The extension is out of scale, will be a visual barrier, changes the character of the neighborhood and is a clear violation of the Residential Design Guidelines.


- She recommends that the Commission direct staff to continue to work with the Project Sponsor and neighbors to come up with a design that is in compliance with the Residential Design Guidelines.


(-) Peter Winklestein - PAR


- The Richmond has wonderful mid-block open spaces.  These projects intrude in a way that changes the character.


(-) Claire Alexander


- One of the things that drew them to live in the Richmond was the wonderful open space.


- The addition has the potential to impact future buildings.


- The open space should be preserved.


- A compromise plan should reduce the floors from two to one.


(-) Jim Alexander


- He just saw the plans that were dated June of this year.


- It appears that the owner is willing to change design and he would like to continue working with him to come up with a better plan.


- He opposes the plan as currently submitted.


(+) Richard Ngo - Project Sponsor


- They applied for this project in 2002.


- None of the neighbors came to him to discuss the project.


- He has complied completely with all the requests from the Planning Department.


- He asked that the Commission not take Discretionary Review.


ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and Disapprove Project for the following reasons:


 The Commission found that the existing pattern of mid-block open space on this block was unique within the Richmond District and merited preservation under the Residential Design guidelines.  The Commission further found that the proposed addition would cause a significant negative impact to the mid-block open space.


 The Commission found that the proposed addition was inefficient in its layout by creating a large (550 square foot) unprogrammed and unoccupied `storage' space on the ground floor and only a 240 square foot `family room' on the second floor.

Request for Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit Application No. 2003.09.09.4302, proposing to construct a full floor one-story vertical addition on a single-family dwelling, located in a RH-1(D) [Residential, House, One-Family (Detached)] District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation:  Do Not Take Discretionary Review and approve the Project 


SPEAKER(S):


(-) James Finnegan - Discretionary Review Requestor


- He lives adjacent to the subject property.


- If the vertical addition is allowed he will loose sunlight in various rooms of his house.


- It will cast morning shadows on his gardens and shadows to the east side yard.


- The deck will affect his privacy.


- He would like a setback of six feet.


- Forest Hill is a historic area.  A lot more can be done to bring the proposal more in conforming with neighborhood character.


(-) Joseph Barbaccia


- He has lived behind the subject property for about 35 years.


- He loves living in the Forest Hill area.


- There are still issues that need to be dealt with.


- Because 266 Magellan was built low, decreasing the available light on the east side, the house would loose intrinsic value and cast shadows.


- The Commission should take this into consideration when they come to a decision.


(-) Jacqueline Apple


- She lives on Magellan, almost directly in front of subject property.


- The Pacheco steps are known to be one of the most beautiful architectural steps in San Francisco.


- There are two homes on the block that are from the 1950s.


- The subject property is a two-story home and once it goes to three floors it will become an exceptional presence.


- It is sad that they have to come here and not be able to work things out on our own.


- Her biggest concern is that the proposed project will not be in character with the neighborhood.


(-) Timothy Murphy


- He and his wife have been living in the neighborhood for about 29 years.


- The architectural issue is the main issue for him as well.


- The project is out of conformity and out of character.


- A two-car garage is not an acceptable style for this neighborhood.


(-) Harold Wright - Chairman of the Architectural Review of Forrest Hill


- He recalls that the first set of plans were designed by an engineer and they were awful.


- He suggested that the project sponsor hire an architect.


- He had to make some suggestions even though he is not an architect but an engineer.


- One of his suggestions was to take the suggestions from the neighborhood.


- The new plans show some improvements but he knows that there could be more.


(+) Linda Wong - Project Sponsor


- Her home is a single story.   She wants to build another story because her family is getting larger.


- She was told that she could not build another story because the adjacent homes would loose value.


- After the extra floor is built, it will still be lower than the neighbors.


- She has various signatures of neighbors who are in support of her project.


(+) Andy Forrest - Project Designer


- He was brought into the project in mid May.


- He has lived in Forrest Hill for about 10 years and is aware of all the different styles of homes in the neighborhood.


- He is an engineer but has an architect in his office.


- He has been designing homes for about 25 years.


- There are 16 people who have looked at the plans and do not oppose it.


(+) Grace Shanahan


- The square footage of the house is not that big compared to the rest of the homes in the neighborhood.


- She does not understand how the Discretionary Review requestor has a problem with the sunlight since it will not impact him.


- She encouraged the Commission to approve the project and create a home for the project sponsor.


ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and approved the project with the following modifications:

Request for Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit Application No. 2003.10.22.8304, proposing to construct a vertical addition and add one residential unit at the existing one-story over garage two-unit structure. The project adds two partial floors, increasing the overall building height from 20 feet to 40 feet and converts the building from two to three units within an RH-3 (Residential, House, Three-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.  
 


Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take D R and approve the project.  


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Eleanor Achuck - Discretionary Review Requestor


- She and her husband purchased the property in 1978.


- They are not developers; just regular people who wanted to have something for their retirement.


- They have five units and the rent has decreased.


- It takes them five months to re-rent units that become vacant.


- They agree that the project sponsor can build the third floor.  But is the mezzanine above the third floor necessary?  This would be a luxury addition and could be deleted.


- She just asks the Commission to consider their hardship.


(-) Edward Achuck


- He is the son of the Discretionary Review requestor.


- There are several buildings that are tall.   But everything is two stories above a garage.


- The small mezzanine is totally out of character. He is fearful that if approved, it will set a precedent.


(-) Timothy Chuck


- He and his wife purchased a building in the neighborhood about 23 years ago.


- Value decreases because of the decrease in sunlight and view blockages.


- This project will decrease the value of properties in the area.


- This will affect their retirement plan and their livelihood.


- He is mostly opposed to the top mezzanine.


(+) Greg Kirkland - Project Sponsor


- He and his wife purchased this property a few years ago.  They felt they were the luckiest people in San Francisco.  They love their home and love their neighborhood.


- Their family is growing now so they want to expand their property.


- Before he did anything, he spoke to his neighbors so they could discuss issues on the project.


- He then went to the neighborhood design organization to discuss issues as well.


- He believes that the non-conformity issue is without merit.


(+) Kenneth Rua 


- He is not opposed to the project.


- There is no merit to the Discretionary Review.


- If there were any issues to take Discretionary Review over it should come from the neighbor to the north because it would create shadows that would impact them.


- The project sponsor is an owner occupied tenant.


(+) Kay Chang


- She is Mr. Kirkland's neighbor to the left and to the right.


- She asks the Commission to approve the plans.  The project sponsor has gone beyond the call of duty to discuss the project with all the neighbors and is concerned with the entire neighborhood.  


- This project will enhance the neighborhood.
