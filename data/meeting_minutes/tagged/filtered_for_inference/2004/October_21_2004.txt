SPEAKER(S):


(+) Steve Atkinson – Project Sponsor


- He welcomed Commissioner Alexander.


- There was a proposal made.
 
 They were not able to accept it because it would not be feasible for his client.


- The project presented today does include changes.


- The interim policies should not be imposed on projects that are still in the pipeline.


- The project provides nine affordable units.


(+) Mary Murphy – Representing Yerba Buena Lofts


- She was hoping that there would have been an agreement by now.


- The proposed project is located on a street that has well designed housing projects that required exceptions to open space, etc.


- The design requirements of the policies are perfectly tailored to the physical circumstances of the project.


- She urged the Commission to adopt policies and not controls.


- This project should conform to the policies imposed.


(+) Hope Whitney


- The project sponsor does not meet the height requirements.


- This project seeks to reduce the amount of rear yard open space required.


(+) Ann Marie Kuban - YBL


- This project is denying the urban requirements.


- They want to be good neighbors and are excited about the project but they should abide by the same regulations and rules that the Planning Department requires for the rest of the city.


(+) Paul Bard - YBL


- This area is his home.


- Shipley Street is his back yard.


- He is concerned about the building in its present form because it will damage the feeling of neighborhood.


(+) Ed Tansev - YBL


- He displayed a photograph of a project that was previously approved in the area and compared it to the current project that will be located right next to it.


- He displayed a diagram of the buildings located on the street where the project will be located.


(+) Jeremy Yun


- He lives on Folsom Street.


- He congratulated Commissioner Antonini on his reappointment.


- He is pro-development but it should conform to the guidelines that the Commission set forth.


- He does not understand why a development would be unfeasible if it is built under the Commission and Planning guidelines.


(+) David Cadarian


- He is an architect and lives in the Yerba Buena Lofts.


- The project should respect the scale of the alley.


- He displayed a diagram comparing the current proposed height of the building with the height if the project followed the guidelines.


(+) Azalea Merrell – Carpenter's Union


- This project will utilize high skilled union workers.


- It will provide a number of two bedroom units, which are very much needed.


- Affordable housing is scarce in the city.


- She is concerned that projects seem to start under a set of rules and then another set of rules is implemented.


- She submitted a petition with names of people who would have liked to come but instead signed the petition.


(+) Jim Salinas – Building and Construction Trades Council


- He is asking for the support of this project because it will be 100% union.
 


- This means that it will provide work for good workers.


- The Commission has a responsibility to do good for the City.


- This project sponsor has done due diligence in the neighborhood and the community.


(+) Anthony Faber – SOMA Leadership Council


- Rezoning is being done in SOMA and it needs to be started in the alleys.


- If buildings are too high in alleys, they [the alleys] become a  canyon. 


- He hopes that the Commission will abide by the controls.


(+) Bill Kedem


- He lives near the Embarcadero.


- He is in favor of the project.


- The Variances requested are very reasonable.


- The project will be very pleasing to the eye.


- There are other buildings that are as tall or taller.


- It is not fair to subject the project sponsor to a new set of rules.


(+) Jim Meko


- Everyone wants this project built.


- The SOMA leadership council voted to stand in solidarity with the YBL and other neighbors on the issues still being addressed.


- If this project is approved as presented today, they will support an appeal to the BOS.


- If the Commission does adhere to the policies, the BOS will.


(+) Tim Tosta – Steefel, Levitt and Weiss


- He displayed an aerial photograph of the buildings in the area.


- This is a difficult site.
 
 The project has gone through many changes.


- There is actually no solution.

Requests for Variances.
 The proposal is to construct a nine-story, mixed-use building with up to 69 dwelling units, up to 5,000 gross square feet of ground floor commercial space and a 62-space parking garage.
 
 A rear yard modification is sought under Section 134(e) to provide rear yard open space within an inner court and on a 7th floor setback of 10-15 feet along Shipley Street.
 
 A variance is sought from dwelling unit exposure requirements, as the horizontal dimensions of the inner court do not meet the requirements for an open area as defined under Section 140(a)(2) for dwelling unit exposure, and 27 of the 70 units have no exposure other than this inner court.
 
 The site is within an RSD (Residential/Service) Mixed-Use District, and a 40-X/85-B Height and Bulk District.

Request for Conditional Use Authorization
 to modify conditions of approval set forth in Planning Commission Motion Number 15935 and relating to Planning Department Case Number 99.209C to allow payment of an in-lieu affordable housing fee rather than provide on-site affordable housing, pursuant to inclusionary housing policies set forth in Planning Commission Resolution Number 13405. In October of 2000, the City authorized construction of a 4-story over basement building containing 32 dwelling units, 14,200 gross square feet of commercial space, 75 below-grade parking spaces, and an accessory building with 2 townhouse units. This building is now complete. Conditions of approval require three of the proposed units to be provided as Below Market Rate (BMR) units. This proposal would modify previous conditions of approval to allow the payment of an in-lieu fee to the Mayor's Office of Housing rather than provide the 3 required BMR units on-site. No physical work is proposed. The property is within the Haight Street Neighborhood Commercial Zoning District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


 
 Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions.


 


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Matthew Brannan


- This proposed amendment is to allow an in lieu fee.


- This was not done in the year 2000 when the project was originally approved because the policies were different at that time.


- They are not asking for something drastic.


- When this project was originally granted, the inclusionary housing was just a policy.


- The formula for inclusionary housing was established by the Mayor's Office of Housing in 2002.


- He hopes that the Commission will not penalize them for something that they had no control over a few years ago.


(-) Calvin Welsh – Height/Ashbury Neighborhood Council


- There are three points here:
 
 1) the Height/Ashbury district needs the affordable units; 2) the Residential Inclusionary Program (Section 315 of the Planning Code), while allowing in-lieu fees, actually favors including the housing in the market rate project; and 3) the proposed fee is too little to result in three affordable units in  close proximity to the principal project  as required by Section 315.5.


- For these reasons they request that the Conditional Use be denied.


(+) Mark Brennan


- The Planning Department is recommending that the in lieu fee for this project be at 17% of the total number of units in the project.
 


- He urges the Commission to release the project sponsor of any obligations to either provide on-site BMR units or provide an in lieu fee in place of on-site BMRs.
 


- In the alternative, he urged the Commission to recommend an in lieu fee based on 15% of the total number of units in the project, not the recommended 17%.


(+) Andrew Smith


- He is favor of this proposal.


- It is important to provide as much housing as possible in the City.


- Citywide funds need to be spent in the best possible way.


- He urged the Commission to approve this resolution.


- There is a premium one pays if one builds off site.


(+) Ann Brennan


- The opposition by the Height/Ashbury Neighborhood Council is actually personal.


- She read a letter from the council (previously named Haight Ashbury Improvement Association) dated August 14, 1976 when she and her husband were supportive of a project similar to this one.


(+) Joe O'Donoghue


- This project has become a personal vendetta.


- Mr. Welsh does not offer any reasoning for not building in the Haight/Ashbury area.


- The neighborhood should not be punished because in 2000 the City did not state a certain percentage for the total number of affordable units


(+) Alice Barkely


- It is appropriate to grant the CU and allow the payment of the in lieu fee.


- The funding from the government is insufficient to cover the building cost.


- The City is going to need to look at additional funding so that it could use local funds from in lieu fees to subsidize the housing projects that have been approved by the Commission.


- It would be appropriate for this Commission to grant the Conditional Use.

Movie Theater Demolitions
 - 
Consideration of an Ordinance to amend the Planning Code by adding Section 221.1 and to amend Sections 703.2, 803.2 and 803.3
 to require Conditional Use authorization for any project involving change of use or demolition of a movie theater; amending Planning Code Section 303 to require specific findings as part of a Conditional Use authorization for a change of use of demolition of a movie theater; and making the Ordinance retroactive to any site permit application submitted after July 27, 2004; making findings of consistency with the priority policies of Planning Code Section 101.1 and the General Plan.








Preliminary Recommendation: Approval




SPEAKER(S):


(-) John Malamut – City Attorney


-
 Supervisor Peskin authorized him to bring this legislation to the Commission.
 
 The Supervisor supports this legislation and hopes that the Commission will move it forward to the full Board.


- The amendment that the Supervisor is proposing would be in the retroactive provision.
 
 Rather than referring to a site permit application it would refer to an environmental evaluation application filed on or before July 27.
 
 It is just changing what particular application one is talking about.








- The one other change is that the provisions that amend Section 303 are listed as Subjection I.
 
 Since this was drafted many months ago, this subjection would be subsection k.


(-) Nancy Denney Phelps


- She is a producer of music for film and animation.


- More and more neighborhood theatres are being closed.
 
 This is very sad.


- Community theatres are very much a convenience.


- Many people do not travel downtown.

- He operates the Four Star Theatre in the Richmond District.


- This theatre has been showing independent films for 12 years.


- There have been countless petitions to maintain the theatre.


- The large theatre chains have no concern for the neighborhood.

- Neighborhood movie theatres have served as important community spaces and anchors for commercial spaces.


- It is important to recognize the importance of these theatres.


- This legislation will allow for careful analysis of a proposed conversion from a theatre to another use.


(-/+) Chung Ning Lee


- She spoke through a translator.


- She has been a member of Canaan Lutheran Church for many years.


- Their church has an English and Chinese congregation.
 
 Because they have been growing, they now need to find a new location.


- They would like to have it located in the Richmond District.


- The church members have contributed a lot of money for the expansion of their church.


(-/+) Mrs. Tao Chui Ying


- She spoke through an interpreter.


- She is a member of Canaan Lutheran Church.


- She is happy about the church expanding.

- Currently the church shares space with another church.


- There are many senior members in their church, so finding a place in the Richmond District is important.


(-/+) Gilbert Jay - Attorney


- He represents the Canaan Lutheran Church.


- It is important to have good legislation.


- Canaan Lutheran Church purchased the theatre property in March of 2001.
 
 They were aware that there was a tenant there that had a lease until 2005.
 
 The church has not interfered with their right.
 


- With this new legislation, will there now be an impediment from the tenant for the church to enjoy their rights?


- He is just asking for an exception for the church.


(-/+) Pastor David Tin


- The church actually began serving the community in 1968 in the Richmond District.


- There are about 275 members.


- They are a non-profit organization.


- They have been doing a lot of fundraising in order to purchase property for their church.


- Their plan was to wait until the lease was up in order to do the renovation.


- He went to 15 merchants on Clement Street and they were all supportive of the church.


(-/+) Henry Chan


- He is a member of Canaan Lutheran Church.


- There are about 275 members.


- They are very concerned about the moratorium currently being proposed.


- They don't have a house of their own.
 
 That is why they purchased the old theatre.


- They are trying their best to raise funds.


- They belong to the community and are there to give and not to take away.


(-) Ruth Tam


- She has a childcare center in the Richmond District.


- She was also raised in the Richmond and belongs to Canaan Lutheran Church.


- The church provides a lot of services to the community, especially to children.


- A lot of people in the community need their services.


(-) Ed Jew


- He is a third generation San Franciscan.


- The majority of the people speaking today came to the United States to have freedom.

SPEAKER(S):


(-) Jim Bustamante – Representing Discretionary Review Requestors


- There are about 50 or more neighbors who are opposed to this design.

Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and modify the project.




 


SPEAKER(S):
 
 Same as those listed for item 22a.


ACTION:
 
 Took Discretionary Review and approved as modified:


1.
 
 
Remove the fourth floor from the plan and limit the height of the building to the height of the adjacent building to the north,


2.
 
 
Remove the 12 foot by 15 foot extension from the rear of the building.
 
 External stairs, extending no more than 6 feet toward the rear, may be constructed on the rear of the building in this location.


3.
 
 
Recess the garage door a minimum of 3 feet,


4.
 
 
Recess the front entry door a minimum of three feet and include a stoop and porch roof or similar elements to better articulate the entry,


5.
 
 
Vertically align the entry door and the southerly windows on the front faÃ§ade and the center the garage door on the bay window on the floors above,


6.
 
 
Eliminate the pedestrian door on the north end of the front faÃ§ade or place the door within the recess for the garage door so it is not obvious from the street, or eliminate the interior door leading from interior rooms to the corridor served by the second door,


7.
 
 
Reduce the width of the garage door to 8 feet.


8.
 
 
Limit the driveway width to 10 feet and require landscaping of the entire front yard with plant materials, except the driveway and a walk to the front door.


9.
 
 
A three inch reveal will be required on all front windows,


10.
 
 
Only a half bath, without bathtub or shower, will be permitted on the ground floor.


FINDINGS


The reason the Commission took the action described above includes:


The proposed new construction, as submitted, creates an exceptional and extraordinary circumstance as the proposed construction does not comply with the Residential Design Guidelines, is not compatible with the context of the neighborhood, because it is larger and more massive than neighboring buildings, has a volume and mass that exceeds that of the other dwellings on the block, disrupts the pattern of midblock open space, the height of the building is not compatible, and is out of scale with the other buildings on the block, disrupts the pattern of building heights on the block,
 
 is not consistent with the Priority General Plan Policies of Planning Code Section 101 and does not support and advance the objectives and policies of the General Plan.

SPEAKER(S):


(-) Cathy Keller – Discretionary Review Requestor


- She loves living in San Francisco and was very excited when she purchased her house.


- She requests that the Commission reduce the size of the proposed building.


- Step back the two top floors and maintain the landscaping.

- The Project Sponsor did not seek any input from her or her neighbors.


- The project architect mentioned that she would have to file a Discretionary Review in order for changes to happen to the project.


- She does not intend to delay the project.


- She asked the Commission to take Discretionary Review, set back the top two stories in the rear by 10 and 6 feet and preserve existing trees.
 
 This modest request will maintain the same number of rooms, provide some relief from an overwhelming vertical mass above their open space and allow more light to the downhill properties.


(-) Michael Daly


- He and his wife have lived in the neighborhood since 1982.


- They are asking for a minor setback on the rear of the project.


- There are many successful project sponsors who have their projects approved because they follow the guidelines.

(-) Donna Peck


- She has lived in the neighborhood for 23 years.


- The mass and bulk of the project needs to be considered.


- She is concerned.
 
 She lives at the bottom of the hill and the project is at the top of the hill.


- The building is not only deep but also very tall.


- The rear yard addition will leave neighbors feeling boxed in.


(-) Bruce Bonacker


- He is representing the Glen Park Association.


- They don't normally involve themselves in neighbor disputes but this is a precedent setting development.


- They visited both parties but only the Discretionary Review requestor agreed with their suggestions.

Request for Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit Application No. 2004.04.21.1841, proposing to construct a two-story deck addition to an existing single-family dwelling in an RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project as proposed.




 


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Simon Higet – Representing Discretionary Review Requestor


- He read a letter from the Discretionary Review requestor.


- The subject project will be too large and is completely out of scale.


- There are various signatures from neighbors who oppose the project.


- He displayed a photograph of how the deck will impact his house.


(+) Yikes Scott – General Contractor – Representing Project Sponsor


- They have gone through all of the guidelines and this project is well within the guidelines and the Planning Code.


- The building to the left is the neighbor who is opposed to the project.
 
 Her deck is above the proposed deck.


- The height of the property on Arkansas Street vs. the size of the project on Connecticut Street is a significant amount.


- A statement was made that work was done without a permit and that is absolutely false.


(+) Kelley Dermity


- She has been in the neighborhood for four years.


- She tried very hard to work with the neighbors.


- The neighbor wants a deck that would be a 2 or 3-foot deck.
 
 This is a non negotiable solution.
