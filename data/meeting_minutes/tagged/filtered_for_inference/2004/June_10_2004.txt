REQUIRED SECOND MEANS OF EGRESS
 - Ordinance 
            Amending the San Francisco Planning Code to Allow a Required Second 
            Means of Egress 
Adoption of an ordinance amending the San Francisco 
            Planning Code
 by adding a new section 136(c)(4)(A)(i-v) to allow 
            certain stairways that are a required second means of egress under 
            the Building Code, as permitted obstructions in the rear yard. The 
            California Building Code no longer allows fire escapes as a second 
            means of egress in most cases. This proposed text amendment provides 
            an exemption to meet the requirements of the Building Code. This ordinance 
            also includes changes to Section 311 and 312 to require neighbor notification 
            for the addition of these stairways.


Preliminary Recommendation: Recommend approval 
            of the ordinance to the Board of Supervisors.

 ALTERNATING CASE TYPES
 - 
On February 
            19, 2004
, the Commission adopted the recommendation of Acting 
            Director, Larry Badiner to mix each calendar by alternating case types. 
            (i.e. Discretionary Review type cases would be first one week on the 
            calendar and Conditional Uses and other type cases would be first 
            the next week). The Commission also instructed that this be brought 
            back to them for review in three months. 








At this time, the Commission will review 
                  the effectiveness of the current alternating case type on the 
                  Commission calendars. They will consider maintaining it, modifying 
                  it, or abolishing it.








SPEAKER(S): None


ACTION: Commission directed that cases continue 
            to be alternated on calendar as they currently are.

<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
10. Director's Announcements




- Report on the Certificate of Appropriateness 
            for 212 Union Street.








- Cottage proposed for substantial alternations.




- proposal is to raise the cottage; excavate 
                to provide a living area; put open space on top of living areas; 
                then construct a cottage.


- This project had an earlier Certificate 
                of Appropriateness, it was heard by the Landmarks Board who concurred 
                that the existing building has an entrance on the Union Street 
                steps. They determined that it was important to maintain those 
                steps.


- The project sponsor is concerned that a 
                real stairway to a false entry does not make sense.




- It would be useful to hear from project 
                  sponsor.








SPEAKER(S):


Janet Crane


- She displayed a drawing of the courtyard showing 
            the old building as well as the new one.


- The owners feel that they would really like 
            to relocate the front door to the courtyard.


- They did have a complete permit and Certificate 
            of Appropriateness.


Mr. Freebairn-Smith


- He just wants to assure the Commission that 
            this project, even though it is very old, that nothing casual is happening 
            here.


- The courtyard entry is the most logical way 
            to enter the building.


Jeremy Paul


- He did extensive research on this property a 
            few years ago.


- After putting in lots of research, the owner 
            decided that he was not interested in the challenge of the task so 
            he decided to sell the property.


- He is glad that the new owner is taking really 
            good care of the property.


ACTION: Director Badiner has taken the matter 
            under advisement and will report back to the Commission at a future 
            hearing.

Re: Transbay EIR Appeal


- It came to the attention of staff that a number 
            of Supervisors believed that they did not have the actual EIR. There 
            was some discussion as to whether to continue this item or not. Ultimately 
            it was continued.


Re: 690 Market Street


- This is a major renovation to the building.


- The project sponsor wanted the Mills Act to 
            have relieve from taxes.


- The discussion with the Assessor has taken place 
            over the last year with the project sponsor.


- The Board granted a continuance of this item.


BOA - 


Re: 572 San Jose Avenue


- This was to modify a two unit building. The 
            Commission denied the Discretionary Review. The item was continued 
            again because both sides have new attorneys.


Re: 899 North Pont


- This was a demolition of a gas station. The 
            demolition report indicated that they would be able to do additional 
            soils testing. There will be a Negative Declaration following.

Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions




SPEAKER(S):


(+) Mark Rene - Representing the Project Sponsor


- It is noted on the materials that 6
th
 
            and Market had been the premier district for theater use after World 
            War II, then there was a decline. Since 1990 the area started a late 
            night revival.


- 6
th
 Street after 11:00 p.m. is one 
            of the premier districts now for late night entertainment.


- These types of businesses create a safer area.


- Staff has recommended approval with conditions. 
            However, he would recommend that the hours change from 5 p.m. to 4 
            a.m. on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights and nights 
            before National Holidays.

- He owns a business across the street from the 
            bar.

th
 Street.


- He has worked with Mr. Cruz to fight crime and 
            prostitution and make the area safe.

            a positive impact on that street.


(+) Roger Gordon - Executive Director of Urban 
            Solutions from the Redevelopment Agency


- Mr. Cruz is a member of the Board of Directors.


- He has been working with the Redevelopment Agency

            Market Street and replace the empty store fronts on 6
th
 
            street.

th

- Limiting the entertainment for certain days 
            of the week would hurt the business.


- Many entertainment venues exist with resident 
            units above.


(+) Gerald Sampson


- He is a resident of 6
th
 Street.


- He knows the owner and there have not been any 
            problems with the club.

            ages 12 to 23.

            They have actually passed a resolution declaring San Francisco in 
            a health crisis for the lack of venues for young people.


- The Youth Commission is in support of expanding 
            entertainment venues.


(+) Minish Kaina


- He is an artist and a producer.

(+) C. Cheng


- He has worked with Mr. Cruz on booking events.


- A lot of people have said that they are not 
            sure about going into this neighborhood. The ones that decide to come 
            realize that they can keep coming back to other events.


(+) Terrance Allen - President of the Entertainment 
            Commission


- With the formation of the Entertainment Commission, 
            the Planning Commission can differ many of the responsibilities they 
            have had related to entertainment.


- The conditions that are before the Commission 
            are not from the Entertainment Commission but from the Police Commission.


- They want to standardize, across the City, the 
            way entertainment venues relate to their neighboring businesses and 
            residential uses.

Request for Variance - 
Section 151 of the Planning Code 
            requires one parking space be provided for each 200 square feet of 
            occupied floor area, where the occupied floor area exceeds 5,000 square 
            feet. The proposal to expand the project results in a total of 8,647 
            square feet for the establishment. The project expands the existing 
            use beyond the 5,000 square foot parking threshold and would require 
            52 parking spaces. The project does not propose to add any parking 
            spaces and therefore requires an off-street parking variance. The 
            subject property is in an RSD (Residential/Service) Mixed-Use District 
            with an 85-X Height and Bulk district.


SPEAKER(S): Same as those listed for item 13a.

(Continued from Regular Meeting of May 6, 2004)


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Pat Buskovitch


- This building has been vacant since 1998.


- The owner of the building passed away this morning, 
            butt his daughter would still like to go forward with the project.


- The building cannot be rented for office.


- Most of the buildings in the area are commercial.


- There are a number of parking lots in the neighborhood.


- The building is on a major transit line.


- There is plenty of open space in the front of 
            the building.


- The project will add housing units to the City's 
            housing stock.

Request for rear yard and non-complying structure variances 
            
for the proposed conversion of office spaces to two dwelling units 
            on the second and third floors of an existing three-story building 
            with a full-service restaurant on the ground floor. The proposed conversion 
            would not alter the size of the existing building. Because the existing 
            building already encroaches into the required rear yard, it is considered 
            a legal, non-complying structure, and the conversion of the two upper 
            floors from commercial use to residential use triggers these variances. 
            The site is within an NC-3 (Neighborhood Commercial, Moderate-Scale) 
            Zoning District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.

Require that Adult Entertainment Uses 
            are no less than 1,000 feet from schools, child care facilities and 
            playgrounds - 
Consideration of an Ordinance amending San Francisco 
            Planning Code Sections 221, 790.36 and 890.36 
to provide that, 
            where permitted, adult entertainment uses must be no less than 1,000 
            feet from public and private schools, child care facilities and Recreation 
            and Parks Department children's playgrounds, and making finding of 
            consistency with the priority policies of Planning Code Section 101.1 
            and the General Plan. 


Preliminary Recommendation: Approval


SPEAKER(S):


(+/-) Terrence Allen - President of the Entertainment 
            Commission


- Why is this coming forward at this time? This 
            legislation needs to be understood.


- This legislation came forward as a "knee 
            jerk" reaction to the change in programming at a club located 
            at 220 Jones Street as opposed to a well thought out piece of legislation.


- He does not know all of the details of what 
            will be amended.


- There has to be an equanimity into the law.


- The definition of "adult entertainment" 
            needs to be defined.


- He has the third draft of this legislation available.


(+) Earl Jogers - Chaplain San Francisco Rescue 
            Mission


- The City has almost studiously avoided regulating 
            this industry and this needs to be done.


(+) Bill Barnes


- If the goal is to not have children near these 
            adult entertainment venues, then some guidelines need to be established 
            for both.


ACTION: Adopt with Modifications: 1) Define what 
            adult definition is; 2) a school (K-12, private or public) cannot 
            locate within 1000 of an existing adult entertainment facility; 3) 
            shall not be considered a non conforming use under Section 180 of 
            the Planning Code and may therefore be intensified or expanded; 4) 
            childcare facilities shall make themselves known regardless of size; 
            5) notification shall be given to residents of the neighborhood and 
            6) re-examination of fees.

Request for Discretionary 
            Review

            RH-1 (D) (Residential, House, One-Family, Detached Dwelling) District

SPEAKER(S):


Re: Continuance


Walter Kapland - Representing Discretionary 
            Review Requestor


- There is a substantial number of neighbors that 
            would like to have a continuance since they were only able to meet 
            with the project sponsor just a few evenings ago.


- The Planning process works well when things 
            are resolved outside of Planning Commission hearings.


- Sutro Tower agreed to do a seismic retrofit, 
            which will be finished this weekend. This project is not good for 
            the neighborhood.


- He asked the Commission to request another meeting 
            with the neighbors and the project sponsor to talk about height, bulk, 
            etc.


Jeremy Paul - Representing Project Sponsor


- This item has been continued several times.


- It is time to get this project resolved.


(The above comments were taken under the ITEMS 
            PROPOSED FOR CONTINUANCE category. It was decided to address that 
            question at the call of the item.)


Re: The question of Continuance was again heard 
            at the call of the item.


Walter Kapland


- He submitted a copy of a letter from Paul Negalscue 
            who is withdrawing his support of the project.


- All the people who had supported the project 
            have withdrawn their support.


- He believes that this project can and should 
            be approved in a modified way in the future.


- To have a hearing now would open scabs and put 
            "salt on wounds." This project will not allow for neighbors 
            to talk and find solutions.


Jeremy Paul - Project Sponsor


- During the brief discussion that was held before 
            the hearing, there was mention that the Commission had recently received 
            information therefore justifying a continuance. 


- There is no new information. The comments from 
            the neighbors were filed on April 20. A lot of staff time has been 
            spent on this. There is no time to get involved any more.

            for Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit Application No. 2003.08.11.1725 
            proposing to construct a one-story vertical addition to the existing 
            one-story over garage building in an RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) 
            District with a 40-X Height and Bulk Designation.


Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary 
            Review and approve the project as submitted.


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Gayle Keck - Discretionary Review Requestor


- They are in complete agreement that if the project 
            sponsor agrees to install a skylight in their home, they would agree 
            with the project.


- They have not received a response regarding 
            the request to install the skylight.


- She purchased the house about 20 years ago.


- The window in the bathroom is the only window 
            on that side of the house.


- She and her husband had to move away from San 
            Francisco but rented the house.


- The renters are really concerned about the light 
            that will be lost from that window.


- If they were forced to pay for the skylight 
            themselves, they would have to raise the rent and this is something 
            they do not want to do.


(-) Paul Herman


- He read a letter from the tenant that is currently 
            renting the property who requested that a skylight be installed because 
            otherwise the proposed project would block light and air to the bathroom.


(+) Claire Pitcher - Representing Project Sponsor


- The Discretionary Review requestor submitted 
            a bid and the cost for the skylight would be $16,500 - this is not 
            reasonable.


- She requested that the Planning Commission take 
            Discretionary Review and approve the project as presented by the project 
            sponsor.


ACTION: Take Discretionary Review and required 
            the project sponsor to pay up to $3,000 for the installation of a 
            skylight. Payment shall be upon proof of installation.

SPEAKER(S):


(-) Susan Taggart


- This Discretionary Review is just about preserving 
            the open space.


- Land for gardens is at a premium.


- They want to keep development into the open 
            space at a minimum.


- Her aunt purchased the house recently so she 
            is very interested in what is built.


- There are no buildings that match the project 
            sponsor's project.


- Because there is a flat roof, the height of 
            the extension would be extremely high.


- Bring the extension back 4 feet or remove about 
            54 feet of living space form the proposed project. Require that all 
            roofs be fire rated and metal railings to be kept as parapets.


- They are not asking to change much.


- We are proposing these very small changes.


(-) Jean Taggart


- She is Susan's aunt and is 85 years old.


- The project would block sunlight to her property 
            and eliminate her privacy.


- Being next to her niece and nephew-in-law makes 
            her very happy.


(-) Lol Hansen


- He lives on the same block where the proposed 
            project will be located.


- The block that they live on has very modest 
            houses.


- Most of the lots there have gardens, trees, 
            shrubs.


- The addition is inappropriate for what is on 
            their block.


- To him, the project was shocking.


- There are also concerns of privacy.


(+) Steven Step - Project Architect


- He displayed a diagram of the proposed project.


- The units are not very large.


- The biggest issue is how they work with the 
            neighborhood and how to appeal to their concerns.


ACTION: Do not take Discretionary Review and approved 
            the project.
