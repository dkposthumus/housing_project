2. Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner W. Lee:


Re:  Planning Director Search Status


- He is receiving a lot of calls related to the status for the search of a Planning Director.  What is the status?


Commissioner Bradford Bell:


Re:  Planning Director Search Status


- Since she returned from her trip she has not had time to speak to the Chair of the search committee.  As soon as that is done, she will communicate with the Commissioners.


Commissioner Olague:


Re:  Bringing Back Public Comment to the Beginning of the Calendar


- She has asked this before and wants to know how this item can be scheduled for discussion?


Commissioner Hughes:


Re:  Bringing Back Public Comment to the Beginning of the Calendar


- He is not ready to give his comment about this today but with a bit of research the issue can be discussed in order to know how this Commission's practice is related to the other Commissions and Board of Supervisors.


Commissioner Antonini:


Re:  Bringing Back Public Comment to the Beginning of the Calendar


- Does the public comment period last 15 minutes?


Commission Secretary Responded:


Re:  Bringing Back Public Comment to the Beginning of the Calendar


- When she started with the Commission there was no time limit on general public comment.


- At one time, it seemed that too much time was devoted to this and it caused an impact on items that were scheduled behind it.  They tried setting a 15 minute time limit, but it was not usually followed.  Ultimately, following a public hearing, the Commission amended their Rules and Regulations to change the Order of Business for their public meetings, and placed Public Comment at the end of the calendar.


Commissioner Sue Lee:


Re:  Bringing Back Public Comment to the Beginning of the Calendar


- She is open to discuss this issue.


- She is interested in seeing the research.


Commissioner William Lee:


Re:  Bringing Back Public Comment to the Beginning of the Calendar


- This should be scheduled.


Commissioner Bradford Bell:


Re:  Bringing Back Public Comment to the Beginning of the Calendar


- She would like to have this issue scheduled when there is a full Commission.


Director Green responded:


- He will work with Ms. Avery and provide this information to the Commission ahead of time.

Re:  464 30

Mark Madsen


- He is one of the 50 petitioners who is thankful to the Commissioners who were able to do a site visit.

- He presented documentation on why this report is inaccurate and misleading.


- He urges the Commission to consider this.


Nancy Davis


- She expressed her thanks to the Commissioners who came to see the project.


- It is important to preserve the enjoyment and tranquility of their homes.


John Sanger


- They took the Commissioner's concerns quite seriously.


- They devised and went back to the Discretionary Review requester with revised plans.


- He had not received a response until a day before yesterday, which did not allow enough time to provide the appropriate copies to the department.


- The Commission did not give direction to preserve views.


- He displayed a diagram of the façade of the building.


- He feels that they have been quite reasonable.


Christopher Moscone


- He did respond to Mr. Sanger's proposal and they did take some time to respond because of vacations, etc.


- He did not get a response to their response until [just] before the hearing.


- He appreciates the time that the Commission has taken on this and will allow more time if necessary to try to work out  minor differences.


Claire Pilcher


- This is not a view issue as Mr. Sanger states.


- The garden in the back of one of the neighbors is actually unbelievable so the issue here is not about view but of livability.


Re:  77 Bluxome Street


John Behanna


- He has had his art studio for many years.


- Bluxome Street works because there are a number of businesses there.

- All the units at the podium level have direct access to the courtyard.

Charles Brelinger


- He has received various letters of support.


- There has been very favorable feedback from the community


Charles Lorencen


- There are going to be SROs popping up in the future.


- Perhaps the issue here is density.


- This project is being built to the maximum capacity.


- He urged the Commission to reduce the density and the number of units and make the units larger.


- There are safety concerns related to SRO's.


- He feels that a Mandatory Discretionary Review would be most adequate.


Sean Keagran


- He read a letter from the SOMA Leadership Council who supports the project.


Joe O'Donaghue


- There are many SRO's in various cities of the United States.


- Many people don't seem to like people moving in and out of SRO's.


- The units being built in other cities are actually even quite smaller.


- This project is a good project so long as it meets the standards imposed by the Commission.


Jeremy Nelson - Transportation for a Livable City


- He was concerned previously with the garage, but the project sponsor has reduced it to an acceptable width.


- He displayed maps of San Francisco showing the various districts and showing which ones are transit friendly areas, where car share locations are, etc.

Preliminary Recommendation:  Take Discretionary Review and approve the project with modifications.


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Bruce Bonacker - Project Architect


- The concerns are that there will be loss of sun and privacy, and a reflective glare will be produced.


- He displayed a drawing showing how the new project will impact the Discretionary Review requestor's home.


- The project sponsor has not been available to review and comment.


- The surrounding buildings are taller, but they are built as cottages instead of in the mid-block open space.


(-) Chris Christensen


- He is representing the residents of the building.  He submitted a petition representing people who are opposed to the project.


- He is wondering why the structure cannot be lower.  The building is already on space that should be open.


- These  projects hardly ever turn out the way they were promised.


(-) Vanesa Weisbrod


- She is speaking on behalf of her grandmother.


- The proposed project would intrude on her privacy.


- Loss of light would be detrimental to her health--she is 80 years old.


- Since her grandmother cannot go out that often, she enjoys staying at home and enjoying the sunlight that comes in.


(-) Amanda Powers


- Her kitchen is what her family uses as a family room.


- The proposed project will definitely interfere with her privacy.


(-) James Hutchinson


- He has lived on 17
th
 Street for many years.


- The proposed project will block valuable daylight.


- He does not understand how the project sponsors have been able to live in their home for eight years just fine and currently decide to expand and now the neighbors have to live in their shadow.

- They have been residents of this house for 11 years.


- They simply do not have the money to purchase a new house.  If they are not allowed to renovate, they will have to move out of the City.


- The increase is not that large.


- Their home is quite small.


- They have tried to minimize the impact on the neighbors.


- All of the surrounding structures will still be taller than their home even after the renovation.


- They have MUNI underground next door so there are a lot of vibrations.  They are not looking for master bedrooms either.

- They have no objection to the project sponsor's horizontal extension but they do object to the vertical extension.

- When this neighborhood was built, it was designed with very few parks.  The neighborhood was single-family homes.


- The back yards should be preserved for open space.


(-) Mavis Nathan


- She has never received any notification of this project.  Her neighbors notified her.


- She objects to the project because the project would set a precedent in favor of much larger homes in the neighborhood.


- This will change the character of the neighborhood.


(-) Deborah Brown


- The character of the neighborhood would be disrupted if this project were approved.


- She questions how the Code would allow houses this high in this neighborhood.

Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and Approve the Project with Modifications


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Ray Chang - 1
st
 Discretionary Review Requestor


- There are only five houses on the block that have ever been renovated or extended.


- The proposed project does not fit into the character of the block or our neighborhood.


- There does not seem to be any consideration of the Residential Design Guidelines.


- If the project goes through as is, his home will be devalued.


- The project sponsor suggested painting the wall where the addition is going to be.  He does not care about the color because he does not want that wall there.


(-) Marcela Roar - 2
nd
 Discretionary Review Requestor


- None of the neighbors in the area were notified until they received notification from the City.


- They are concerned about the negative impact this construction will have on their homes, open space and the integrity of the neighborhood.


- The project should be modified by reducing the height 12 feet and the rear extension 18 feet.


- Her husband gets up at 5:30 a.m. to walk or jog so he goes to sleep early.  [The way the houses are now we] can hear noises from the adjacent house.  She requested that a sound wall be installed.  A building inspector should also be hired to ensure that the materials used in the project are of the highest quality.


(-) Eileen Bocken


- She opposes the project.  She lives one block away from the project.


- The size is too massive and she is concerned with its compatibility with the other homes.


- There have been a number of transactions in the Assessor's records.


(-) Sara Del Monte


- She lives in the neighborhood.


- She does not see why the project sponsor needs to build such a monstrosity.


- The homes in the neighborhood are single-family homes.


- She treasures San Francisco enough [to oppose this].


(-) Ellen Chiang


- She was born and raised in San Francisco.


- This addition is too large for the mid-block open space.


- The area is zoned for single family homes.


(+) Rex McClain - Project Architect


- The project sponsors want to add bedrooms and a bath.


- The project sponsors have a large family.


- He feels that having four bedrooms is not an unreasonable expectation.


- Although leaving the first floor open is odd to the project sponsor, they will be using the space as a covered out door patio for their children to play when there is bad weather.


(+) Victoria Liveron


- She and her husband are planning to have another child for a total of three.


- Many of the homes in the neighborhood have gone through renovations.


- They have tried to design the smallest possible addition allowable.


- The empty space on the first floor will be used as a family room or as an enclosed play area.


(+) Alex Liveron


- The requestor's bedroom has a large top to bottom patio door where sun will not be blocked.


- They made an offer to the Discretionary Review requestors in order to deal with the issues they have.


- He has a list of things that they would like to offer to the DR requestors that is available to the Commission.

ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and modified the project by:  the two story horizontal rear addition is not to exceed 13 feet from the existing rear wall.

- The other issue here is the rights of a property owner compared to the rights of the neighborhood.


- Since this has to be negotiated with the people that it impacts, they have made revisions to the plans to reflect their issues.


- He mentioned that although this is the developer's project, he as well and the project architect live in the neighborhood.
