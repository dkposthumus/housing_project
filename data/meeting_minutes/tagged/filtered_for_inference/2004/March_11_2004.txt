10. Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner Antonini:


Re:  Information provide by Commissioner Bill Lee last week


- He thanked Commissioner Bill Lee for distributing the report from the Committee on Jobs of the San Francisco City and County Budget.


- The most interesting item in the report is that the 300 million dollar shortfall was not a one time situation but rather endemic of a structural problem in the budget and is evidenced that there has been a huge increase in the size of the work force from 1995 to 2003; and our per capita spending is far in excess of other cities.


- he has taken part in a study that was done in 2001 and this was exacting the finding when they compared the cities of San Jose and San Francisco.


- He would like to calendar a discussion in the future of this particular study.  It does ask a lot of questions regarding the sort of things the Commission does in terms of approving projects, housing policies, etc.  Do these decisions influence the budget of the City?


Commissioner William Lee


Re:  Landmarks Advisory Board


- Last week there was a presentation from the Landmarks Board.


- Is there enough staffing allocation for historic preservation and for someone to get a Certificate of Appropriateness?


Acting Director Badiner responded:


- The answer is no.


- There have been two staff positions lost in that unit.

Preliminary Recommendation:  Take Discretionary Review and approve the project with modifications.


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Larry Paul - Representing Project Sponsor


- He showed various photographs of how the project would look compared to the adjacent homes.


- He also displayed pages from the Residential Design Guidelines showing how the project could be changed to be in conformance with the guidelines.


- By having a top floor setback it would lessen the impact of the building.


- The rear deck is quite large and does not need to come all the way out.  It could be cut out a few feet.


(-) David Pelavin


- He lives on this street.


- There is a deck on the second floor on the north side.  This deck should be removed because from it one could look straight into his dining room.  There is not much need for that deck.


- If this deck is not removed, he would like to have some privacy lattice installed so there is no view into his dining room.


- This project takes away one of three off street parking spaces.  If there are additional cars with this house, that will create a problem.


(-) Amanda Hillery


- She is concerned with the general character of the neighborhood.


- She is concerned about the footpath that runs to the north of the proposed property.


- This is like a green oasis and is used by the general public.  There are some undesirable rodents and they might be displaced if this project is approved.


- There have been landslides due to erosion.  She would like to be ensured that the proper measures will be taken to not have any of the neighbors be impacted by the instability of the soil.


(-) Jackie Pelavin


- Many of the neighbors have been there for many, many years.


- The proposed house will create a huge shadow and huge scale impact on her house.


- The proposed house will be double the size of her house.


- Every house on this street has setbacks.


- They are not opposed to the project, but there are changes that she would like the Commission to take into consideration.


- She is concerned with landslides.


(-) Eugene Barsotti


- He has lived on this street for 41 years.


- One of the problems with this house is that the lot is designed so that the house could be setback from the sidewalk.


- He does not understand why the house does not fit the size of the lot.


- The house will just look completely out of place.


(-) Patricia Barsotti


- She read a letter from her neighbor who is not in support of the project.


- She could not attend the hearing because she is an elderly, house ridden senior.


(-) Christine Hausson


- She lives right next door to the proposed project.


- The area has not changed for many, many years.


- Prior to filing this Discretionary Review, she wrote to the project sponsor and this person failed to comply.


- She is not opposed to the building; she would like the Commission to look at all the issues presented by the people who are opposed.


(-) Hans Hausson


- This area is noted for landslides.


- The concern about the slippage is very important to him.


- There are a lot of eucalyptus trees and these trees do not have deep roots.


- He is concerned that the roots of these trees will be impacted and can cause a danger to the neighbors.


(-) Charles Cunningham


- Using photographs of  distant views of the area, he showed how the proposed house would compare to the other homes.


- He is concerned with the probability of slides.


(+) Archie Occhipinti


- If he built the project the way the Discretionary Review requestor's architect asked him to he would be invading the sidewalk by 10 feet.


- There is no possible way that the DR requestor could see his deck.


- He has to have an elevator.  There is no way he can get an elevator in a 22 foot pad.


- He thinks that the architect should take another look.


- He is curious to know if he has appeal rights.


ACTION: Hearing Held.  Public Comment Remains Open.  Item continued to April 1, 2004.  Staff is to contact the Department of Building Inspection for input on what (if any) special procedures are needed regarding the soil conditions.  The project sponsor is encouraged to meet with neighbors.

- She presented photographs of the street without the finished project compared to a photograph of the street with the finished project showing how incredibly massive it is and overwhelming for this site.


- At a minimum, one story of this building should be eliminated.


(-) Tony Rodriguez

- Part of Dr. Calvert's lot serves as vehicular access and paring for 13 residential units.

(-) Carrie Novatney


- She agrees with all the concerns of the neighbors.


- No matter what happens, they will be able to maintain their view of Coit Tower.


- She is very concerned about the mid-block open space.  It will be negatively impacted.


(-) Jerry Mutz


- They overlook the mid-block green space to the north.


- His interest in this green space is not about views but about cherishing a soft area and their gardens.


- This area is a home for raccoons and birds and not for an extremely large home.


- The residents of the block really treasure and appreciate open space, greenery and pathways.


- The neighbors approved the previous proposal because it respected the open space.


(-) Catherine Mutz

- She read a letter from Ms. Duffy.


(-) Fred Sherman


- He and his wife live on Lombard Street.


- This is a true neighborhood with a great deal of friendliness and concern.

(-) Jim Salinas

- This little house should have been able to be renovated without designing it in such a large and massive way.


- Houses that are affordable starter homes for some families are being torn down.


(-) Penelope Clark - Co-Chair of the Russian Hill Neighbors

(-) Valerie Young

- She has lived in the area for 18 years.


- She and her husband are opposed to this project because it involves demolishing a medium sized home and replacing it with a very large, very massive, four level structure.

44 LURMONT TERRACE
 - a cul-de-sac on the north side of Leavenworth Street between Greenwich and Lombard Streets; Lot 025 in Assessor's Block 0071  - Request for Variance from the rear yard requirements of the Planning Code to construct a single-family dwelling partially into the required rear yard, within an RH-3 (Residential, House, Three-family) District, and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.  Section 134 of the Planning Code states that in an RH-3 District, in the case of any lot that abuts along both its side lot lines upon lots with buildings that front on another street or alley, the minimum rear yard depth shall be 25 percent of the total depth of the lot, or 15 feet, whichever is greater.  On the approximately 80-foot deep subject lot, this results in a rear yard requirement of 20 feet, with the south side of the lot being considered the rear.  The proposed construction would project into the required rear yard by up to 11 feet at the ground (garage) floor level, extending to within 9 feet of the south property line.  The application requesting a Variance will be heard by the Zoning Administrator.

The problem with that is that no one was notified of this continuance.  There probably would be more people here today to speak on this project.  That is why he would like to have this project continued.


- He is also concerned that when construction is going on and because the street is quite narrow, this could cause problems if there were to be a catastrophe.  He would suggest that the construction equipment be put below the spot where there is a constant bottle neck.


(+) Hector Navarro


- He knows the area quite well.


- He supports this project.  The current building is quite ugly.

PERMITTING TOURIST HOTELS OF 75 ROOMS OR LESS IN THE SERVICE/SECONDARY OFFICE (SSO) ZONING DISTRICT
 - Consideration of an Ordinance amending the San Francisco Planning Code by amending Section 818 and adding Section 818.78 to Table 818 to allow a tourist hotel of 75 rooms or less as a principal permitted use in the SSO (Service/Secondary Office District; adopting findings of consistency with the priority polices of Planning Code Section 101.1 and the General Plan.


Preliminary Recommendation: Disapproval with recommendations.


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Bill Barns - Office of Supervisor Daly


- Supervisor Daly supports the recommendation of planning staff.  Approvals through Conditional Use is a good idea.  Supervisor Daly also believes that by making it through Conditional Use, the question of displacing PDR is addressed.  The Commission would have to have a hearing if PDR is being displaced.


- All of the Commission understands that the South of Market community planning process needs a little work.


- The residents of SOMA are interested in a variety of uses.


- The SOMA residents do not want the Community Planning Process to inhibit development.


- This legislation is appropriate while the Community Planning Process is finalized.


(+) Jim Meko - SOMA Leadership Council


- The staff recommendation is flawed.  If staff included more facts the recommendation would have been approval with some recommendations.


- All seven Commissioners have approved removing SOMA from the Eastern Neighborhoods process.  Now staff has gone ahead and taken the areas back into the process without approval of the Commission.


- Staff is considering a radical down zoning of the area and some of the western South of Market.


- This kind of legislation should be based on the context of a healthy mixed use and not isolating PDR.


- Western SOMA was removed from the Eastern Neighborhoods process because the process was unresponsive to how the residents envision the future of SOMA.  No one supports Core PDR.


- He urged the Commission to approve the legislation.


(+) Ernesto Cerrillos


- He has been a hotel worker for many years.


- He is in favor of building small hotels.


- There would be more opportunities for employees.


- San Francisco is a beautiful city and this would provide a large income for the City.


(+) Circe Sher - Metrovation


- She has been working with Supervisor Daly to allow a hotel on her property.


- She believes that the site on 5th and Townsend has evolved into a good site for a hotel.


- There are great amenities in the area to support a hotel.


- The hotel would have 50 rooms and the design would be elegant and historical.


(+) Wayne Wilson - 655 5
th
 Street Homeowners Association


- Everyone in the association is in support of this legislation because we believe it will bring vitality to the neighborhood.


(+) Mark Dumolien - 695 5
th
 Street Homeowners Association


- He echoed Wayne Wilson's comments.


- Hotels provide 24% foot traffic and it fits with the live/work businesses and others in the area.


- He support the legislation.


(+) Peter Morse - Townsend Association LLC


- He owns a business in the area and has seen how it has developed.


- This legislation would not displace any PDR uses.


- There is a lot of talk about whether the neighborhood should be exclusive PDR.  He is unaware of the discussions on this subject.


- The hotel will enhance the mixed uses in this vibrant neighborhood.


(-) Mark Seiler


- His major concern is that he has not been involved in the community planning process.


- His concern is that his property will be down zoned and this will have a negative impact on him.


- He would like to be included in the community planning process.


(-) David Baker


- He displayed a map of SOMA explaining how it is so out of date.  But this map was printed form the database.


(-) Sue Hestor - Hotel Workers Local 2


- There is no compelling reason to do this outside the completion of the South of Market planning process


- The hotel workers really track what is going on in the hotel industry.


- Right now the hotel industry is going through a tough time.  There is a high number of vacancies.


- The focus was misplaced in the staff analysis.


- It is totally proper to have a finding in this area.


- Local 2 is against this legislation and is against anything that would take away any of the Conditional Use provisions.


(+) Jaime Rossi - Chamber of Commerce


- He submitted a letter from neighbors who are in support of the project.


- Any plans to extend CalTrain would have to stop at 4
th
 and Townsend.


- The area is a truly a mixed use area.


- This is going to bring PDR forward and not backward.


- Hotels create hundreds of construction jobs and jobs within the hotel.


ACTION: Approved the legislation with recommended modifications that would include requiring Conditional Uses in that area and to not allow hotels on sites where there has been PDR use for the last 18 months.

Preliminary Recommendation: Approval


(Continued from Regular Meeting of February 26, 2004)


SPEAKER(S):


(+) David Owen - Representing Supervisor Peskin


- Supervisor Peskin will be proposing at the Land Use Committee the following amendments:  1) the first amendment clarifies what the floor area ratio base is for public buildings meeting a strict criteria for landmark statutes in the ordinance.  The basis of what is used to calculate the amount of TDR that could be available for sale for such a building; 2) where a development lot must be located to transfer P building TDR meeting the historic criteria set forth in the ordinance parallels the existing language in section 128 was omitted in the draft of the ordinance; 3) corrects a missed cross reference which is the old section 5 and is crossed out in the proposed amendment so that the concept of the arts funds could be used on exterior elements needs to be restated at that point in the ordinance.

 -  east side near Berkshire Way; Lot 031 in Block 7277 - Request for Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application No. 2003.08.08.1594S, proposing to construct a horizontal and vertical addition to an existing single family dwelling in an RH-1(D) (Residential, House Districts, One-Family, Detached Dwellings) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District. 


Preliminary Recommendation:  Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project as submitted.


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Denis Driscoll - Discretionary Review Requestor


- He is requesting that the proposed construction be modified because it will cause a negative impact on his property and it is not consistent with the Residential Design Guidelines.


- With his proposed compromise, he will still loose some light and a window but he is willing to compromise.


- He showed photographs demonstrating how with the new construction he will loose a large a mount of sunlight to his property.


- He suggests that they lower the ceiling height from 9 feet to 8 feet.


(-) Joanne Driscoll 


- She and her husband are native San Franciscans.


- Their daughter is allergic to mold and is asthmatic.


- She requests that their family needs be considered as well.


(-) Leslie Zamarripa


- She owns property on Country Club Drive.


- She feels that the project that is being proposed is out of scale and will take away from the planned openness.


- Plans are not customarily read easily.  Once built, projects have proven to be a different matter than what was drawn.


- She is concerned that the height will diminish light and increase mold to the DR requestor's home.  This will be quite a problem since their daughter is allergic to mold.


(-) Nancy Berger


- She has been a homeowner on  Country Club Drive for many years.


- She read a letter from a neighborhood who was not able to attend the meeting and is against the construction.


(+) Therese Peffer - Project Designer and Agent


- The proposed addition would only be above the crawl space.


- They have complied with all of the Planning Codes as well as the Residential Design Guidelines.


- She believes that there will be no impact on the neighbors.


- She has designed a setback of eight feet.


- There are several [existing] precedents in the neighborhood (she showed a photograph of a few on that street).


- She is not clear if the 56 signatures that are not in support of the project saw the project or they are just against construction completely.


- She does not believe that this addition is exceptional or extraordinarily.


(+) Maria Bonkowski


- The construction is just simply because they need an extra bedroom for their child.


- There are many homes that have construction additions.  So the neighborhood will change inevitably.


- The design is harmonious with the other homes.


- She hopes that the Commission will consider their concerns.


(+) Joseph Bonkowski


- He and his wife included the DR requestors many times.


- In the beginning the DR requestors were only concerned with privacy, then it became air, then it became sunlight until they came to a complete stop.

- He displayed a diagram showing the scale of the adjacent homes.


- The proposed house will have a negative affect on his view.


- With the current arrangement, there is a telephone pole and wires coming to his house.  He does not know how the construction will affect these wires.


- The project will also have a negative impact on the property value of his home.


(+) Rodrigo Galimba - Project Sponsor


- The answer to the DR requestor's question is that the construction will not block the view.


- The new house will not extend more than what is allowed.


- The sun rises in the east and the sun travels from east to west.  So from 7 to 10 he will receive a lot of sunlight.

- This home is for their family only.  She hopes that the Commission will approve their proposal.


- The proposed project will comply with the design requirements of the neighborhood.

SPEAKER(S):


Re:  Continuance


Eric Christenson


- He was shocked to find out that this item was not on today's calendar.


- He called the case planner regarding the omission and the planner did not give it too much importance.

- He agrees to the continuance so long as the item is properly noticed.


Rom Vernalli


- He was just told that he was going to be on the calendar today.


- Even though he just found out about being on today's calendar he is prepared to go forward with the case.


Re:  Merits of the Project

- There are Residential Design Guideline issues here as well.


(-) Ruth Bender


- She just moved to Noe Valley.  She loves the character of the neighborhood and the open space.


- When she looks outside her front door she has sunlight.  If this building is approved she will loose this sunlight.


(-) Steban Guevara


- Demolishing and building such a monolith will send the cost of housing out of reach.


- The point here is that people should understand that they need to maintain their homes.


- He is concerned about his garden.  It is an extension of his home and needs to have sunlight all the time.


- The proposed project will allow the people who will live in that building to look into his garden, bedroom and dining room.


(-) Eve Maher


- She feels that this project is not in compliance with this neighborhood.


- It will cut out sunlight for many hours.

- The building should just be scaled down.


(-) Eric Christensen


- He has a lot of support for his compromise for this project because it will only have three floors.


- They are asking to move the stair penthouse, reducing the depth of the building. 


- The neighborhood has mostly three story houses.


(-) Amy Van der Wyk


- This is very important to her because her children spend time in their sunny back yard.


- Her husband went around the neighborhood to see other key lot homes.

- He went to members of the community to discuss the project.


- There have been several letters of supports.


(+) Jim Athenrod

- The project fits the character of the neighborhood and will be a plus.
