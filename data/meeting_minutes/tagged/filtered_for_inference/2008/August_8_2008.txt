Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Condition

(Continued from Regular Meeting of August 7, 2008)


 


SPEAKER(S)


Steve Kuklin, Project Sponsor


-
 
 Since receiving project approval in June 2006, Fifield has been working diligently and has spent a substantial sum of money on the design and permits in an effort to commence construction of the project as early as possible.


-
 
 Uncertainty in the market for condominiums has required us to seek disposition of the project as an apartment building.


-
 
 That process has cost us a substantial amount of time and we are thinking to re-discuss the project with stakeholders.


-
 
 We submitted a letter in April requesting a hearing for formal expansion.
 
 We are asking for a 12 month extension of the entitlement.


Sue Hestor


-
 
 
You can not do what you are being asked to do because the agenda describes a one year extension but the package is asking to modify the project.


-
 
 
The plans do not represent what it is currently in the area. 
 
They are missing different buildings.


-
 
 
You are being asked to require complying with a requirement to give feedback of who are the occupants, where they work and how they get to work?


 


ACTION:
 
 Approved extension of the entitlement to June 15, 2009 deleting all the language that refers to amending prior conditions of approval.

 Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).

Future Meetings/Agendas
.
 
 At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.


 


Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 I just want to mention that I have been re-nominated for another term on the Planning Commission and I am up for confirmation as well as Commissioner Miguel.


-
 
 I would like to take this opportunity to say thank you for the six years that I have served, particularly to staff that has been always professional, prepared, intelligent and respectful.


-
 
 I think that has also has been the case with the other Commissioners that I have served with and in most instances it has been the case with the public.


-
 
 It is very important because, being a city that prides itself on tolerance, someone's opinion is different than yours that they are allowed to voice it freely, be heard and not be intimidated.


-
 
 That is a tradition that we have always had in San Francisco and I would hope that it continues in the future.


-
 
 Thank you to everyone, staff and the Commissioners and hope to see you next week.


Commissioner Miguel


-
 
 As Commissioner Antonini mentioned I am also going through the Rules Committee and before the Full Board for confirmation next week after a short four months. I sat out here because I was finishing an unexpired term.


-
 
 It is interesting that people keep asking me how it feels from having been there [in the public] for many years to being up here and I say that now I have more than 3 minutes.


-
 
 The comments about the staff have been excellent.
 
 I was fortunate, and I think everyone is, to have interface with staff over at least 15 years.


-
 
 I have always found them gracious, prompt and intelligent in the manner of how they handle things.


-
 
 I had no idea what it was going to be like serving with the other Commissioners.
 
 It is a very diverse group in every way that you can expected from age to ethnicity, politics and everything else.
 
 It works.


-
 
 It has been a pleasure and I want to thanks everyone.

 The project also includes a historic rehabilitation component, including an exterior faÃ§ade restoration.
 
 The proposed project would not involve any expansion of the existing building envelope.

SPEAKER(S)


Mara Pletzer, Project Developer


-
 
 Our proposed program will provide critically needed affordable housing for the formerly homeless while also preserving the architectural and historic character of the Tenderloin.


-
 
 It would also accommodate the public health clinic that is dedicated for residents of the Tenderloin and community serving retail.


-
 
 The project represents a collaborative effort of the Mayor's Office of Housing and the City's Department of Public Health.


-
 
 It would provide 172 rental apartments for the formerly homeless and two manager units.


-
 
 Support services are going to be offered on a voluntarily basis.


-
 
 Our goal is to assist tenants in breaking the cycle of homelessness and becoming self sufficient and maintaining permanent housing.


Frederick Napp, Architect


-
 
 This building is a category one building.
 
 It has been determined eligible to the National Register.


-
 
 Over the years, it has been altered on the interior but the most significant interior spaces that you would find in the original building are all there with one major exception.
 
 The main stair that was removed in the 1950's will be re-constructed as part of this project.


-
 
 Fortunately for the project and the preservation aspect, there are so many services that the City is supporting in this building that the non-residential spaces are being retained and rehabilitated.


-
 
 The project is applying for Federal Preservation Tax Credit.
 
 The part II has been approved by the State of California Office of Historic Preservation without conditions.


 


Kaila Priera, Mayor's Office of Housing

-
 
 We are seeking a continuance of this item to allow us to continue our community outreach efforts and to also complete our required Environmental and Traffic Review.

 We got issued a building permit for the gates and the security improvements on site.


-
 
 I am committed as well as the Academy of Art to deal with all issues of compliance and completing all requirements.


(+)Leorid Nakkodkin


-
 
 Spoke in support of the Academy of Art University because it is one of the oldest educational institutions in San Francisco serving a diverse population from the City and around the world.


(-)Hiroshi Fukuda, Coalition for San Francisco Land Use and Housing Committee


-
 
 
Previously I submitted a resolution that the Academy of Art has 17 sites for student housing, all in violation, and all have taken away housing from the City's stock.


-
 
 
We do not need to reward or provide incentives to continue this type of behavior.


(-)John Bardis


-
 
 Why continue this behavior?
 
 This is an outrageous example of violation of the City's Codes.


-
 
 I urge you to deny the Conditional Use.


(+)Kelly Kaiser, Marina Merchant's Association


-
 
 We met with this group several times and we are aware of the other violations but there are some other things that are positive that we have to look at.


-
 
 There are willing to help and work with our neighborhood.


(-)Sue Hestor


-
 
 This has been in the process for about two years and they have not completed Environmental Reviews or their Master Plan.


-
 
 Unless the City does not finally say no, they have no incentive to do what the law requires them to do.


(+)Peter Sing


-
 
 This was a motel and it is not taking away any affordable housing.


-
 
 The only mistake they did was not getting your approval and that is why they are here today.

 We are not dealing here about the motel but legalities and repeatedly illegalities.

Planning Code Enforcement Update Board File No. 080525
 
- 
This Ordinance introduced by Supervisor Peskin would amend the Administrative Code Section 10.100-166 to expand the Planning Department's Code Enforcement Fund beyond general advertising signs
 and authorize the Fund to receive revenues from all code enforcement activities, including monetary judgments, and authorize expenditure of the funds for administration and enforcement of all Planning Code violations.
 
 The Ordinance would also amend the Planning Code Section 303(l) concerning relocation of general advertising signs to delete the requirement to submit a site map, clarify that wall signs are included in the requirements and make technical changes to the language of the section; amend Section 358 to increase the annual inventory maintenance fee from $48 to $75 and to clarify use of the general advertising sign inventory fees and that wall signs are included in the requirements; amend Section 604.2 to provide that violation of the Code's general advertising sign inventory requirements is a public nuisance, to clarify that the definition of the term "general advertising sign company" includes the operator of the sign and that wall signs are included in the requirements, to modify language required to be in the affidavit submitted with the sign inventory, to delete the requirement to submit a site map, to conform the penalty and appeal procedure with Section 610, and to make other clarifying and technical changes to the language of the section; adopting CEQA and Planning Code Section 302 findings.
 
 Preliminary Recommendation: Approval.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of August 7, 2008)


 


SPEAKER(S)


(-)Michael Colbruno, Clear Chanel Outdoor


-
 
 The City has been completely misguided and spending the money on going after legal sign companies when the problems have always been the illegal sign companies.


-
 
 We removed signs in the South of Market, 30 to 40 signs, in the last couple of years and new ones have gone up illegally.


-
 
 Requested continuance of this item to look at the actual cost and to sit down with staff.


(-)Anthony Leones, CBS Outdoor


-
 
 
Objected to the 300% inventory maintenance fee increase because of the two main reasons for the increase.


-
 
 
One being the large number of violations and the other is the legislative nature of the sign companies.
 
 However, there is no detailed information contained in the staff's report on either of these issues.


John Bardis


-
 
 
It is really demoralizing to hear this item being discussed before you when there is an urgent need for fees to cover cost in the department.

-
 
 This project is for a small lot and it is intended to be for apartments and not condominiums.


-
 
 We are really bounded entirely by buildings and we have chosen the better aspect of light and ventilation by putting the open space on the roof making it more secure and available.


(-)Fred Mackota

They need to provide more parking spaces and open space as well.

Concerned about a leaking problem from the empty lot through her garage and hoping that could be address during construction.
