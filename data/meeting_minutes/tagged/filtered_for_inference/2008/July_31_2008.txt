Marilyn Amini


-
 
 
Requested a longer continuance.


-
 
 
Read resolution that passed on July 15 by the Coalition for San Francisco Neighborhoods urging to not take any action on the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan.


Judy West


-
 
 
Supported the continuance for one week and recommended to consider impacts on existing buildings and not just the new ones.

EASTERN NEIGHBORHOODS GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENTS
 
- 
General Plan amendments
 that would, 1) add to the General Plan four new area plans, which include the Mission, East SoMa, Showplace Square/Potrero Hill and Central Waterfront Area Plans; and 2) make related amendments to the following portions of the existing General Plan: the Commerce and Industry Element, Recreation Element, Open Space Element, the South of Market Area Plan, the Central Waterfront Area Plan, the Northeastern Waterfront Area Plan, and the Land Use Index.


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 
Adoption.


 


SPEAKER(S)


Debra Stein, Barrel Block LP


-
 
 I would like to focus my thoughts on the SLI which has been removed from the zoning as to use and to look at heights.


-
 
 The Eastern Neighborhoods rezoning proposes height for SLI properties.


-
 
 A development parcel, between Harrison, 3
rd
 and 4
th
 Streets, has been split up into five different height districts.


Tony Kelly, Potrero Booster


-
 
 Formula retail: it is not that we do not want them but we want the choice and that they support workforce.


-
 
 I have an idea about the pipeline: maybe we should stay with the date of January 2007 but the fee to be $20 or something closer to the Nexus study to show what the actual impact is.


 


Shahab Laygi


-
 
 I have a business for birthday parties and indoor entertainment and I got a letter of determination from the Zoning Administrator classifying this as personal services.


-
 
 I have been having a lot of trouble finding a place and I am considering a parcel in the Bayview.


-
 
 Right now it is going to fall under the PDR district and based on the current proposed amendments, it will not be allowed anymore.


Judy West


-
 
 
I would like to speak on the retail overlay along 16
th
 Street, on the far Eastern side, which I think is a good idea.


-
 
 
Please consider that similar retail component along Potrero Avenue in the vicinity of 16
th
 and 17
th
 Streets.


Chris Durazo


-
 
 I am very disappointed with the way that our proposal for a Youth and Family zone turned out.


-
 
 Staff presented three different zones within the Youth and Family zone in the SoMa without necessarily having a vision for them or the relation to them at the ground level.


-
 
 What we are proposing is something that seems as a threat but in reality is 0 to 120% AMI.
 
 It is very broad.


Steve Conez


-
 
 
I am really here to express gratitude for taking this very seriously.


Brett Gladstone


-
 
 
I hope that the office portion of PDR-Hybrid will not count toward the Proposition M limitations.


-
 
 
I also want to make sure that we talk more about the SEW [Small Enterprise Workspace] and the retail in the 16
th
 Street District and I would suggest a compromise because it would be good for 16
th
 Street.


-
 
 
Regarding legitimatization of tenants, I want to make sure that it is clear that it's payment over time with the fees of what is allowed.


Philip Lesser


-
 
 The environment is the most important thing that we need to protect and it does not have to be at the expense of jobs.


-
 
 We need to provide the housing that will have the workers that then will attract the businesses.


Tom Radulovich


-
 
 We think that there should be four neighborhoods CAC to really guide how the $10 fee per square foot is spent.
 
 Think about that instead of one Eastern Neighborhoods CAC.


-
 
 We think that the neighborhood commercial on the Mission that are still NC-1, 2, and 3 that NCT is a much better zoning for them.


-
 
 The RTO zoning would make a lot of sense on the entire Mission and not just on one corner.


Jazzie Collins, SoMa


-
 
 I want to see less density, more low income families, parks, and schools to have a place that feels like home.


Glenn McNulty, TTM


-
 
 I would like clarification on the retail component of the PDR-1G zoning for my neighborhood.


Tom Gilberti


-
 
 
The proposed code changes for the area are going to be 60 beat 65 decimals and with these levels, you can not escape from the noise.


David Prowler, 888 Brannan


-
 
 The hybrid proposal is very intruding to use and I am happy to hear that a compromise has been worked out and am looking forward to see the language.


-
 
 Height issue for 888 Brannan: we would like you to consider asking staff to continue the 65 foot height zone all the way to the back of our block.


Marilyn Amini


-
 
 It was stated by Mr. Rich that there will be a new staff report next week and the action is scheduled for next week.


-
 
 Questioned how the people would have the opportunity to review material and respond to it.


-
 
 The high cost of material affectively prohibits participation of the public.


Satoru Hosoda


-
 
 
Thanked the Commission and all the people that took the time to meet with our group, TTMI.


Eric Tao


-
 
 
I am glad that the PDR policy passed tonight because it provides certainty.


-
 
 
It is important to understand that not all the pipeline projects will benefit from any of the Eastern Neighborhoods plan.
 
 Those who will benefit should pay the full fee.


Reuben Hechanova


-
 
 
We support the middle income housing, retail control on 16
th
 Street, removal of RTO soft-cap density limit, student housing, no conditional use or no density limits, pipeline projects to be grandfathered from January 19, general use and height.


-
 
 
Concerned about the affordability fee analysis.


Sue Hestor


-
 
 
You need to go to the Health Department and ask them if they think that higher housing right against the freeway is a good idea.


-
 
 
I want to go back to the urban design plan as it was put in the Master Plan by Alan Jacobs that says that you want to see the City from the freeway.


Steven Aiolla


-
 
 
We would like to see improved the BART station heights.
 
 It needs to be a lot higher.


-
 
 
The design review provision for buildings over 75 feet, we think that there needs to be threshold language to prevent debating of the policy.


Jim Salinas, Sr.


-
 
 We strongly support staff's proposed change to make the middle income requirement to confirm the financial feasibility analysis.


John O'Connell


-
 
 We support the date of August 3
rd
, 2007 as a grandfather date because that was the date that the industry got the first notice that there were fees moving forward.


 


ACTION:
 
 
Following hearing, the Commission passed a motion of intent to adopt

 Adoption.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of June 19, 2008)


 


SPEAKER(S)


(+)Jim Meko, Chair of the Western SoMa Citizens Planning Taskforce


-
 
 We voted unanimously at our last meeting to release the Western SoMa Community as a draft for citizen review.


-
 
 PDR policy came too quickly to really be able to have an informational hearing and vote on this in a separate meeting.


-
 
 We concurred that we would leave it to our Business and Land Use Committee to bring recommendations to the Commission.


-
 
 We support the PDR loss and replacement policy as it pertains to the whole Eastern Neighborhoods.


-
 
 The changes that are coming in two weeks are more closely tied in to the Draft Western SoMa Community Plan.


(+)Noreen Burn


-
 
 I support adoption because it is something that has been discussed in many public hearings that I have attended.


(+)Grace Shanahan


-
 
 I am in support of PDR replacement policies and appreciate your commitment to vote today and would appreciate your support.


(+)Richie Hart


-
 
 
We are also in support of voting today on the PDR replacement.


Loui Urbano


-
 
 
Share their own experience of having a project stopped on the process because of the Eastern Neighborhoods and PDR replacement proposals.


-
 
 
It is imperative that the pipeline projects be grandfathered-in and the PDR replacement to not be required.


(+)John O'Connell


-
 
 It is imperative that you move and support this today because many projects cannot move forward.


(+)Joe Cassidy


-
 
 
It is time to move this forward today.


-
 
 
You need to move all these projects forward and put people back to work in San Francisco.


(+)Steven


-
 
 I am here to support the PDR replacement policy and to encourage you to re-introduce a level of certainty to our planning process that for too long has been missing in action.


(+)Jim


-
 
 We just ask for certainty and rules in place and to keep in place while the project is on-going.


(+)Steve Kearny


-
 
 Urged the Commission to pass the PDR replacement policy and to move on because I am losing workers.


(-)Tony Kelly


-
 
 
You really need to vote on the plans before voting on the interim policies with the plan.


-
 
 
Otherwise, you would create a powerful incentive to anybody who wants to get their projects through and not to care about the future of the neighborhoods.


-
 
 
Urged the Commission to wait until next week to vote on this.


Sue Hestor


-
 
 
If you are inclined to vote on this today, do so requiring them to come-in with parking requirements and mandatory Commission hearings.


(+)[No name stated]


-
 
 
This process has taken like seven years and all we are asking for is regulations and certainty.


(+)[No name stated]


-
 
 
A lot of projects that are code compliant have been sitting in the pipeline for four or five years.


-
 
 
Vote on this today.


Jim Salinas


-
 
 This is to put San Franciscans to work and you should consider that those jobs provide decent wages and benefits.


(+)Judy West


-
 
 Encouraged to pass this PDR policy because one of the primary advantages is that this country operates on the rule or law.


[Inaudible]


-
 
 The idea of PDR replacement proposed by The Planning Department is confusing, unnecessary and arbitrary.


-
 
 Encouraged the Commission to support one to one replacement.


(-)Chris Durazo


-
 
 
Concerned with the PDR in East SoMa that has been presented as a housing mixed use area.


-
 
 
Urged to hold the vote on this policy until the Commission looks at the amendment to the SoMa Youth and Family zone.


(+)Alice Barkley


-
 
 There is no reason to delay voting in this particular item because it pertains only to projects that could have been approved by you prior to the adoption of the Eastern Neighborhoods zoning controls.


(-)Jazzie Collins


-
 
 Requested to continue this item to next week because there has not been a through analysis of the PDR in the SoMa area.


(+)Jeff


-
 
 
Urged the Commission to vote on this and to not hold up these projects any longer and let the process continue.


Calvin Welch


-
 
 
I would hope that the Commission would contemplate the significant amendments to this legislation for grandfathering which is an actual requirement to commence construction.


-
 
 
It is something that we see all the time that we saw historically in commercial office development in which developers were allowed by this department to hold commercial office approvals for almost a decade and no requirement to move forward.


-
 
 
If you are going to do this, I would urge you to amend this to require that within two years construction start or they loose their permit.

 Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).


·
 
 
Future Meetings/Agendas
.
 
 At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.


 


Commissioner Olague


-
 
 I want to thank Secretary Avery for having a lot of patience during this process because we had to change calendars and she is the person who has to deal with the development community, project sponsors, staff and the Commission.


-
 
 She handled all of this very well and I know this has been an exhausting effort.


Commissioner Borden


-
 
 I was thinking that it would be great if we have a joint hearing with the Small Business Commission.
 
 With all the talk about PDR and small businesses in San Francisco, I think it is important to talk a little bit through all the issues that small business is facing.


-
 
 Another item: 
 
in the papers this week [there is an article] that the Tenderloin lost their grocery store.


-
 
 It would be nice to have a hearing to talk about the Tenderloin and what plan improvements are there because a lot of seniors are living there.


-
 
 And kind of following on to that, we should talk about supportive housing and housing for seniors.

 DIRECTOR'S REPORT


 


5.
 
 Director's Announcements


 


Director Rahaim


-
 
 Ms. Flores is here and she deserves the credit for this.
 
 We recently received a grant with our community partner MEDA, Mission Economic Development Association, of $45,000 from ABAG and Cal Train for what is called the Eastern Neighborhoods Development without displacement.


-
 
 It is a social justice plan to fund community engagement strategies for small business in the neighborhood commercial corridors in the Mission, particularly along 24
th
 Street.


-
 
 The goal is to demonstrate how regional local planning for growth can maximize benefit for current communities and this will be specifically, of course, in the Mission.


-
 
 We are really please and congratulations to Claudia [Flores] and my thanks for making this happening.
