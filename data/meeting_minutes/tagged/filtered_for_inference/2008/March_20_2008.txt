 Commission Comments/Questions


Â·
 
 
Inquiries/Announcements
.
 
 Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).


Â·
 
 
Future Meetings/Agendas
.
 
 At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.


 


Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 
Complimented Sacred Heat Cathedral girls for their championship in Basketball.


-
 
 
Secondly - an article in the SF Chronicle Real State Section last Sunday on TIC and condominium conversion rules and the lottery.
 
 I would say that it was well written and presented various sides to the issue.


-
 
 
Finally - in yesterday's San Francisco Today, they had a list of City workers and their salaries with percentages.
 
 I think it works into a lot of what we talk about in terms of economic development.


-
 
 
For example it would be interesting to find out the percentage that lives in San Francisco.


-
 
 
It would appear that maybe the factors are not simply economics. 
 
What other factors are involved as we struggle to provide housing for families and keep people that work in San Francisco to live in San Francisco?


-
 
 
It is important to identify schools, quality of life issues, type of housing stock being provided, and recreational activities.
 
 It might be good to do some research.


Commissioner Moore


-
 
 Reminded staff that we want to find an opportunity for a dialogue with Presidio Trust. 
 
We asked for this since September.


-
 
 Another thing that we have mentioned frequently on numerous projects is that the condition of approval, where discussions were critical, be brought back to us.


-
 
 We want to see the legal language and how it is ultimately being passed on to project sponsors.


Commissioner Olague


-
 
 55 Laguna, for instance, is a project that we discussed here and it was taken to the Board and there were some last minute changes to what we thought were the conditions.


-
 
 I was curious as to where those changes ended up. 
 
Did they end up as part of the conditions of approval, environmental document language, or as findings versus conditions?


-
 
 I would like a report back to see the process that was involved and the rational.


Commissioner Sugaya


-
 
 On 55 Laguna; I made a motion that had to do with new construction, design review issues and the historic buildings.
 
 Crafting the exact language at the hearing is almost impossible and that is where the issues lay.


-
 
 Besides, there was the EIR and all the different kinds of permits and conditions.
 
 That one is complicated.


Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator


-
 
 It is a unique case and we had some back and forth among staff where your conditions are properly located. 
 
We ultimately sought the City Attorney's advice.


-
 
 Perhaps, you should put it on calendar for next week under Director's Report.


-
 
 In 99% of the cases, we read back to you [your conditions of approval] when we draft it.


Commissioner Sugaya


-
 
 I think this is going to the Board next week and maybe Anmarie might have some feedback next week.


Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 Just a comment on this issue - I think it is all a matter of degree on situations where it goes to the Board of Supervisors and there is a material change.


-
 
 If it is final language of what we already said, I do not know we necessarily have to see it again.


-
 
 Of more concern is in situations where changes are made like on the design - then we should see it again.


-
 
 For future reference, it might be interesting to see at what point we feel that we have to review design changes as we go forward on buildings that have been approved.


Commissioner Sugaya


-
 
 Just a follow up on Commissioner Moore's comments on the museum issue [Presidio Trust]: 
 
it would be nice if we can get it all in context - the museum, theater addition, lodging, and treatment of the playgrounds - all of it is happening at the Presidio.


-
 
 An article in the American Planning Association Magazine notes that Massachusetts' highest court acknowledges negative impacts of tear downs in mansionization.


-
 
 The court noted the popular trend of mansionization and that the expansion of smaller houses into significantly larger ones decreases the availability of starter homes in the community and perhaps excludes families of low to moderate incomes in the neighborhood.
 
 The City may use its policy power to limit these potential adverse effects.

A-
 
 
Northeast Waterfront Historic District Signs.
 
 This legislation is modeled on similar sign controls for Jackson Square.
 
 The district holds the largest number of pre-earthquake industrial warehouse buildings in the City.
 
 
Passed to the Full Board


B-
 
 
Enforcement Penalties.
 
 This proposed ordinance would greatly improve the Department's enforcement capacity through two new administrative fee processes on complex and minor cases.
 
 The Committee amended it with the recommendations from this Commission to increase the fee for major violations to $250 per day.
 
 It also added an amendment that would strike the ability of the Board of Appeals to reduce the fee for major violations to a flat amount of $1000.
 
 
Passed to the Full Board.


C-
 
 
Zoning Controls on the Removal of Dwelling Units
. This legislation would establish numerical criteria to establish when a demolition had occurred and establish processes for reviewing the loss of a dwelling unit either by a Conditional Use for loss of 4 or more units or by Discretionary Review for less than 4 units.
 
 The Committee began deliberations and it will be picked up again on 
March 24.


 


Full Board


 


A-
 
 
Administrative Code: Large Tourist Hotel Condominium Conversion Ordinance

 This legislation would set the rate of condominium conversion at a rate of equal to the numbers of what is being produced.

SPEAKER(S)


Michael Cohen, Director of the Office of Economic Work Force Development

 The City's Economic Plan is a result of Proposition I, which was a voter approved initiative mandating that the City develop a comprehensive plan for sustaining and growing the City's economy.


-
 
 We are extraordinarily grateful to Ted Egan, the principal author of the City's Economic Plan, who joined the City and became the Director of the Office of Economic Analysis.


Ted Egan, Chief Economist


-
 
 The Controller's Office will be writing an economic impact report on Eastern Neighborhoods.


-
 
 Presented economic performance, economic drivers: knowledge and experience, and goals of the economic strategy.


-
 
 Shared some ideas of the economic strategy priorities for the Eastern Neighborhood.
 
 Strengthening the PDR sector is a major goal of the plan.


Sue Hestor


-
 
 As we shift large sectors of the economy into areas without transit, you are condemning the City to congestion by cars. 
 
Transit is one of the enormous issues with the Eastern Neighborhoods.


-
 
 Proposition M, passed in 1996, limited office space and has high priorities against displacement of PDR.


John Bardis


-
 
 This did not seem that there is much quantity of data to obtain quality goals. 
 
Do we have an economic development plan for San Francisco that really is based on some facts?

Marilyn Amini –
 
Re: Market/Octavia Plan, March 27, 2008 hearing


-
 
 I've requested before that this matter be noticed properly and to schedule a hearing on the potential environmental impact of the modifications suggested by the Supervisors


Sue Hestor –
 
Re: Commission's procedures


-
 
 Suggested that projects with changes take a motion of intent and put them on consent calendar to review those changes, especially cases that you start after 10p.m.


John Bardis –
 
Re: San Francisco's Economy


-
 
 Are housing makers in San Francisco really making decisions based on facts or fiction?

SPEAKER(S)


James Hollenbeck, Discretionary Review Requestor


-
 
 This addition would obstruct views of downtown and the Castro from the historic Douglass Street steps, a landmark we all share.


-
 
 It seems to us that they already have more square footage than most families in San Francisco and they have other options to reconfigure their space to better service their needs.


-
 
 We collected nearly 250 signatures in opposition.


-
 
 This past January, our neighborhood group attempted mediation with the Gashi's through Community Boards and they made it clear they were unwilling to change their plans.


(-)Loren Rohr


-
 
 We would like a setback and the addition of two bedrooms instead of four. 
 
It is a good compromise to meet their needs and preserve the steps.


(-)Robert Bireme


-
 
 The view would be almost eliminated and San Francisco would loose another important landmark.


Cathy Gashi, Project Sponsor


-
 
 Our plans are co-compliant and have been approved to add three bedrooms.


-
 
 Even after the addition, the downtown area of San Francisco and Castro Street would still be visible.


-
 
 We had a study analysis done, which was not required, and that shows that there would be little impact on the corner.

 It is important for this family to stay in the neighborhood because of the genuine quality life and diversity.

Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Take Discretionary Review and modify the project.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of March 6, 2008)


 


SPEAKER(S)


Jeremy Paul, Representing the first Discretionary Review Requestor


-
 
 There is a substantial difference of what is being shown to the neighborhood and what is actually on record for the proposal before you. 
 
There is confusion in the documentation.


-
 
 There is a light well proposed by the project sponsor, not officially provided to staff, that needs to be open and not obstructed.


-
 
 The Residential Design Guidelines said a lot about profiles and meeting the standards of design in the surroundings.


-
 
 I think that this building needs to be redesigned to be more contextual with the setting.




Rick O'Rouke, Second Discretionary Review Requestor


-
 
 There are a lot of people that are concerned about the project.
 
 Not all of them are going to speak tonight, but this is a very serious matter for our neighborhood.


-
 
 The two areas that the neighborhood feels is out of line with the Residential Design Guidelines are:
 
 (a) roofline is incompatible and we're asking that the pitched roof be lowered to a flat roof, and (b); the scale is five feet higher than any other house on the block making it inconsistent.


-
 
 We just want this project to be consistent with the neighborhood.


(-)Melanie


-
 
 We support the growth, but we are just asking that it be managed in a way that respects the character of the neighborhood.


(-)Diddie Dimmer


-
 
 We are not opposed to renovation or expansion in our neighborhood, but we are simply asking that it be done in a manner that is consistent with the style/scale of other houses in the neighborhood.


(-)Cindy Rudor


-
 
 I request that you lower the ceiling heights from 14 to 12 feet.


(-)Mark English


-
 
 By lining up the floor levels at the front of the house, in the back it would be possible to immediately reduce the overall height by 3 or 4 feet without affecting the number of rooms or size.


Louis Felthouse, Architect

SPEAKER(S)


Lu Blazej, Project Sponsor Representative


-
 
 I think we've got it right this time and have proved to be a responsible operator for the last six months and the commitment is to continue it.


-
 
 There is 99% support.
 
 There are a few in opposition from those who have not been participating in the neighborhood meetings.


-
 
 In terms of outreach, we have done as much as possible and I appreciate all the work from neighborhood associations.


(-)Brian Kendall


-
 
 This is not appropriate for a residential neighborhood.
 
 They have violated their permit and have generated over 10,000 phone calls to the Police.


(-)Bruce Carpenter


-
 
 I'm opposed to the project because they have a lack of respect for the neighborhood, the nature of the business on 17
th
 Street, and I'm concerned with the faÃ§ade design on 17
th
 Street.


(-)Alan Gibson


-
 
 Allowing expansion is like rewarding for failing to comply in the past. 
 
It sets a precedence for the future.


(+)Dennis Richards


-
 
 The outreach of project sponsor has been extraordinary. 
 
They have listened to and are addressing our concerns.


(+)Judith Hoyem


-
 
 Read a letter from Steve Clark, President of Eureka Valley Promotion Association, supporting the operation of the CafÃ©.


(+)Alan Beach


-
 
 The CafÃ© has been very terrific to work with and I have visited them frequently. 
 
And as of November last year, as far as I know, there have been no violations.


(+)Dan


-
 
 This is good for the community and tourists.


(+)Sarah


-
 
 The CafÃ© is not a bar style. 
 
It is very inviting and one of the most important things is to have disabled accessibility.


(+)Jane Warner, Patrol Special Police


-
 
 The CafÃ© has been a good neighbor to the community and has had a wonderful working relationship for the last sixteen years.
