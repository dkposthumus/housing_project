 Commission Comments/Questions


Â·
 
 
Inquiries/Announcements
.
 
 Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).


Â·
 
 
Future Meetings/Agendas
.
 
 At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.


 


Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 I just want to mention an article in today's Examiner about rental properties in San Francisco and posing the question of how many of these are actually taken off the market.


-
 
 They used primarily an example of someone who had a property and took the units off the market for five years to do improvements.


-
 
 We do have a method to measure that if it is done through public records.


-
 
 What is less clear is the number of units that is kept off the market by owners who are often times elderly.


-
 
 I have heard in many instances that people are afraid of not being able to terminate the renter's occupancy if things are done that they do not approved of.


-
 
 Sometimes some of the things are probably not really what the law is and things get out of context or made worse than they really are by conversations.


-
 
 The City should make it as clear as possible as to what the real law is in terms what are the rights of property owners and renters, and what the responsibilities to each other are.


-
 
 I am one to expect that there are a significant number of units that are kept off the market just out of fear by property owners that if they have a tenant that is engaged in activities that they are not happy with, they are not going to be able to get rid of them.


Commissioner Lee


-
 
 First, I want to acknowledge Mr. Rahaim for agreeing to meet with a group of 27 Mayors from China for a study group about planning, environment, and what LEED is.


-
 
 Just for the public information, sn November 2, the Mayor will participate in the World Economic Forum.


-
 
 We are going to have also a person from the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce to bring businesses from China to San Francisco.


-
 
 We already have the largest solar panel industry from China opening its office here and we are pursuing a second solar panel manufacturing company.


-
 
 San Francisco has a new sister city in India.


Commissioner Moore


-
 
 I want to acknowledge Sarah Dennis for updating us on the schedule for the Housing Element Update.
 
 I hope and would appreciate if we were notified of the community outreach meetings.


-
 
 It was on a fascinating web seminar about green communities and comparing what we do with European practice and I want to challenge Director Rahaim to actually go over that seminar with me – the one that I downloaded.


-
 
 It is about comprehensive green planning which goes far beyond LEED.


-
 
 It is an absolutely fascinating subject matter and I want to share with you a success story about a city that is fully environmentally integrated at all levels.


Commissioner Olague


-
 
 I would be interested in that.
 
 Maybe we can schedule it after the sustainability hearing.


Director Rahaim


-
 
 I would be happy to do that and I do have a little bit of history with this concept because we were looking at this in Seattle.


-
 
 They actually looked at the entire district as a green community and not just at a building level.


Commissioner Olague


-
 
 I just want to acknowledge CCDC, Chinatown Community Development Corporation, for attending the brown lunch bag at the [Planning] Department earlier this week. 
 
It was very fascinating with all the activities going on in Chinatown.


-
 
 I think that at some point we should have a short presentation during Director's Report from CCDC on the work that they are engaged in and the planning issues.


Commissioner Lee


-
 
 I was not at that presentation but I would be very cautious because CCDC only represents a small segment of Chinatown. 
 
Other organizations may want to present their views.


-
 
 Another issue, I am finding out that in the last year we are spending an average of one hour on each discretionary review.


-
 
 We should have some guidance because we are spending too much time.


Commissioner Olague


-
 
 I think there is a lot of work that the department is doing with the Matrix Report.
 
 I think the department has been working on that.


Larry Banider, Zoning Administrator


-
 
 Just to inform you, we are working on the discretionary review process.
 
 We are developing some proposals and we hope to bring that to you in October.

 Director's Announcements

Director Rahaim


-
 
 It has been one of the busiest weeks.


-
 
 You probably have seen a lot of media coverage over a letter that we sent to the Golden Gate Bay Bridge district.


-
 
 That letter was primarily on design issues and it was sent to the district.
 
 It was not a position of the Mayor and it was simply a condition of the department at this point.

 Introduced by Supervisor Daly.


 


Larry Badiner reported:


 


-
 
 The Board of Appeals is short two members because they are waiting for confirmation and with only three members it is difficult to take action.


-
 
 They are searching for an Executive Director and they had a closed session and voted not to disclose their discussion.

 GENERAL
 
PUBLIC COMMENT – 15 MINUTES


 


At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.
 
 With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting. 
 
Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.


 


SPEAKER(S)


Patricia Vaughey


-
 
 I have five discretionary reviews coming up because there were no compromises and there has been harassing elders. 
 
An application was closed after two years and the developer asked for a revision without paying anything for that. 
 
What is going to be the policy for this department on demolition of homes?


-
 
 More discretionary reviews are coming because planners are saying that projects are code compliant and most of these projects can compromise with neighborhood issues.


Marilyn Amini


-
 
 There is a resolution that is going to be heard before the Land Use Committee on Monday that would allow Conditional Use Authorization for new residential over 20-unit new commercial or retail for over 5,000 square units in a very large area.


-
 
 A letter was sent to you on the 24
th
 saying that it would not be scheduled pending your recommendation.


-
 
 I urge you to communicate with the Board of Supervisors and ask that this matter be held until it is heard here to review and make recommendations.


Tom Radulovich


-
 
 I want to talk to you about timelines and delays that MEA has caused for implementations on some plans.
 
 You should review that.


-
 
 The Balboa Park Plan, the draft plan was release in 2002 and we are still waiting on a program level environmental review.


Jim Meko


-
 
 We were previously scheduled to appear before you on August 21 but we got buried under a pile of Discretionary Reviews and asked for a continuance to September 18.


-
 
 You will be considering adoption of a resolution establishing the Western SoMa Community Plan as the preferred project subject to environmental review.


-
 
 On the previous agendas it was incorrectly identify as an informational presentation but subsequently that was amended to be an action item.


-
 
 I am here to ask that you ensure that both items, our plan and replacement of PDR, be calendared as action items initiating the environmental analysis for the Western SoMa Community Plan.


Paul Wermer


-
 
 I have spoken before about the neighborhood commercial district code that calls for a review which I assume would include community input for the respective commercial districts.


-
 
 I have been told repeatedly that it is coming soon and that we will not be out.


-
 
 Proposed changes are coming to this Commission for Fillmore and Union Streets with no protocol or process.

I have done my neighborhood outreach and basically have the support from all the businesses and a lot of the residents of the block.


-
 
 
There was a concern from some of the neighbors that they would like to see a retail space.
 
 I made efforts to find a customer offering $2.25 per square foot with no success.


-
 
 
This is going to be great for North Beach by providing employment and increased foot traffic.


(+)Paul Scestili


-
 
 I am very much in favor of this usage because the unit has been vacant for a long time.


(-)Joan Wood, Telegraph Hill Dweller


-
 
 The project sponsor promised that there would be retail space below.
 
 There is another Real Estate Agency only half a block away from the proposed one.


(+)Marsha Garland, North Beach Chamber of Commerce


-
 
 That location on Columbus Avenue in North Beach is a very quite block and this project would bring life and business to businesses that co-exist in the immediate area.


(+)Connor


-
 
 I am very delighted to see a plan for that retail space to be occupied because it has been vacant since it was built, almost four years ago.


(+)Shawn Kigrand


-
 
 I am here to support the project applicant because it is consistent with the goals and objectives of the 1900 square feet policy to maintain the character of the neighborhood.


(+)John O'Connor


-
 
 I am here for the project because he tried to lease it to possible tenants and has not found any and he has support form most of the neighborhood.

Request of Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit 2007.12.20.0934, to construct a 3-story horizontal addition at the rear of the existing two-family dwelling and to make alterations to the faÃ§ade.


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project.


 


SPEAKER(S)


(-)Jill London


-
 
 Being a renter there, the parking variance would affect my household by decreasing the number of units from 3 to 2 bedrooms displacing a housemate.


-
 
 The project sponsor has been very vague on the plans for this project.


(-)Peter Rengstorff, Discretionary Review Requestor


-
 
 Concerned about asbestos liability.


-
 
 Tandem parking is an ineffective solution because providing 4 off-street parking spaces is unrealistic and it would increase traffic significantly.


-
 
 The plans were shown for the first time on December 17
th
, 2007 in the middle of the holiday season.


-
 
 It took more than eight months for the sponsor to meet with the impacted neighbors.
 
 That happened two weeks ago, August 28.


(-)Anita Kahn


-
 
 Concerned that the project is going to considerably affect street parking.


-
 
 The main problem with the proposed building is that the size is out of neighborhood's character.


(-)Iris Levitt


-
 
 Parking is a big issue on our block and this project is going to increase it.


-
 
 Shared her own experience of previously requesting a variance for parking spaces and was denied.
 
 The same treatment should be applied to everybody.


(-)Robin


-
 
 We reached out to Planning, neighbors and the project sponsor to mitigate the problems that are going to impact our community because it is such a large project.


(-)Darrell


-
 
 I have tandem parking in my garage and it is very hard to move the cars.


(+)Andrew Mane, Project's Architect


-
 
 The goal of the renovation is to create two family friendly size units.


-
 
 The lower unit, currently three bedrooms, would be two bedrooms and the upper unit would two bedrooms, currently two bedrooms.


-
 
 We are proposing two off-street parking spaces.


-
 
 We have successfully met the Planning Code requirements regarding height, setbacks, and compatibility.


-
 
 We have successfully met with the process sending notifications, meeting with the neighborhood and trying to address their concerns.


-
 
 Regarding the asbestos issue, it is a Health Department issue and it would be taken care of there. 
 
Therefore, there is no merit to take discretionary review.


(+)Bob Vranizan, Owner


-
 
 I have an opportunity to make a contribution to the neighborhood by remodeling a very old, dilapidated building.


-
 
 I met with the neighbors on multiple occasions and we have made changes to accommodate their concerns.


-
 
 Read and submitted letters of support from three neighbors unable to come to the hearing.


(+)Jessica Riebel


-
 
 Supports the project and urged the Commission to approve because this property is the eye-sore of the block -- needing the remodel, and the current garage is not usable.


-
 
 Read a letter of support from a neighbor stating that the house needs to be remodeled.

Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit Application 
#200710165511 to extend the rear of an existing, first and second-level approximately 19 feet of a single-family dwelling within an RH-1 (Residential, House, One-Family) District, and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Take Discretionary Review and approve with
 
modifications


 


SPEAKER(S)


(-)Pavel Knonevsky, Discretionary Review Requestor


-
 
 The project will impact our living covering all the windows of my property and blocking natural light.


-
 
 Our neighborhood climate is mostly foggy, which would increase chances for mildew and I am allergic to it.
 
 This is a health hazard.


-
 
 I understand the need to remodel the house and if there is anyway to reconsider the design to minimize impacts, I will be very happy with it.


(+)Heng-yi Liu, Owner


-
 
 We need more space to accommodate our family including a practice piano room for my wife.


-
 
 Our project meets all the Planning Codes requirements.


-
 
 The distances between the two houses is 7 feet and with the proposed project is going to increase that distance to 11 feet.


-
 
 We understand the neighbor's concern about mildew but mold grows with water or moisture.
 
 The key is to control it.


-
 
 There is no scientific grounds that blockage of sunlight will cause mildew.


(+)Wendy Liu, Owner


-
 
 Submitted a petition signed by most of the neighbors supporting the project.


 


ACTION:
 
 Took Discretionary Review and Approved with modifications offered by staff to match the rear wall and side yard setback to the Discretionary Review Requestor's structure and open the ground level stairs.

(Continued from Regular Meeting of August 7, 2008)


 


SPEAKER(S)


(-)Janet Griggs, Discretionary Review Requestor


-
 
 The project appears to be potentially divided, if not now perhaps in the future, into multiple units.


-
 
 It also changes the character of the neighborhood because it is including seven bedrooms.


-
 
 There is a concern with parking all over the City and the project sponsor is using the garage for storage.


(+)Patrice Fambrini, Project Sponsor Representative


-
 
 The Commission requested that a corrected plan be prepared providing proper dimensions of the Discretionary Review Requester property but the requestor denied access.


-
 
 Most of the neighbors support the project and we are hoping that this Commission will find the revisions satisfactory.


(+)Sandy Mack, Project Designer


-
 
 This project has full support from the neighbors.


-
 
 Parking is not a big issue for this neighborhood.
 
 [Showed photographs of the block]


(+)David Zhu, Owner


-
 
 We are expanding the property because my family is coming to live with me and we need it to accommodate the family.


-
 
 We plan to have only one car because my parents do not know how to drive.
 
 Our intent for the family is to use public transportation.

Request for Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit Application 2005 0503 1415 to demolish the existing structures on the lot and construct a new 4 story, two unit residential building in an RH-3, Residential House, Three-Family District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
 


Preliminary Recommendation: Do Not Take Discretionary Review and Approve the Permit.


 


SPEAKER(S)


(-)Dennis Stewart, Discretionary Review Requestor


-
 
 The proposed project conflicts with the design principles set forth in the San Francisco Planning Department's publication Residential Design Guidelines issued in December of 2003, page 5.


-
 
 The proposed 14 foot increase in elevation height is not compatible with the adjacent buildings which are smaller in size.


-
 
 The project might be within the law technically but violates the spirit of harmony.
 
 It does not provide architectural features that enhance the neighborhood's character.


-
 
 Approval of this permit will continue the slow deterioration of architectural neighborhood harmony that has resulted from previous decisions to allow one by one intrusion of new buildings.


(-)Judith


-
 
 What is being proposed is a demolition of a small building that it is not being shown to be unsound.
 
 Does this building really deserve to be demolished?


(+)Andrew Junius, Project Sponsor Representative


-
 
 This is a building that really does follow the Residential Design Guidelines, steps back on the top, and it is within the neighborhood scale.


-
 
 Architecture is important for the neighborhoods and this project has good architecture with very well articulated building with vertical windows matching the adjacent buildings, nice bay windows as well as a side entrance to the building making it interesting in the front.


-
 
 Light and air should not be an issue because one side is a 15 foot upgrade above the rear yard.


(+)Santos, Structural Engineer


-
 
 
My firm does soundness reports for most residential properties and this one does not require a report because the threshold is worth more than $1.2 million.


-
 
 
There are great architectural features on this project.


(+)Luke O'Brian


-
 
 This building is not historically significant and the project sponsor has been given the permission to demolish the structure at the rear of this building which is not providing any service.


-
 
 The proposal would be increasing living space for people in the neighborhood.


(+)Simon Kwan


-
 
 This lot is a RH-3 lot, which is meant to be high density, and the architect has made efforts to compromise with the neighbors.


 


On the motion to take discretionary review and approved the project to reduce the height by 2 feet on the entire structure and to remove the curved elements on the balcony railings.
