( Tape IA ; IB)
 
 
 
 
(L. Avery: (415) 558-6407)


APPENDIX A of COMMISSION'S RULES & REGULATIONS
 
- On April 17, 2008, the Commission amended their Rules & Regulations - separating out requirements for submittals and hearing procedures.
 
 Those two topics are to be captured in an appendix to their rules and that discussion was continued to May 1, 2008.
 
 The Commission will discuss and consider possible action to adopt, amend, or not adopt proposed Appendix A of Planning Commission Rules and Regulations.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of May 1, 2008)


 


SPEAKER(S)


Sue Hestor


-
 
 Reminded the Commission that they are the original body to consider land use issues and urged them to be on the side of generosity regarding time.


-
 
 The Chair and the Commission have the ability to set the tone of the meeting and move things along and I think that is what you should be doing.


Marilyn Amini


-
 
 
To me the most important thing is the amount of time that you provide for public comments.


Hiroshi Fukuda


-
 
 The amount of time that you provide for public comment is very important. 
 
Also, it is important that you keep a record of the pre-application process.


 


ACTION:
 
 Approved general submission as follows:


-The current practice for submission of case reports and submittals is to continue:
 
 one week in advance for Discretionary Review and standard cases, and two weeks in advance for complicated cases.

-
Revisions should be submitted to staff (and DR requestors) by 5p.m. Tuesday [two days] before the Thursday Hearing.
 
 Revisions submitted at hearings are discouraged and will only be considered at Commission discretion.

 Commission Comments/Questions
 
 
(Tape IB)


Â·
 
 
Inquiries/Announcements
.
 
 Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).


Â·
 
 
Future Meetings/Agendas
.
 
 At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.


 


Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 I noticed that the Mayor had a press release earlier regarding a report that points out higher populations have ramifications and many funding issues. 
 
I thought that was a positive development.


-
 
 I want to bring to the attention of the public that we frequently see the price of homes in San Francisco.
 
 In most recent reports San Francisco is the only county in the Bay Area that seems to show a slight increase in price.


-
 
 However; when you read those reports carefully, they are single family homes.
 
 I am not sure if that is indicative of all ownership, particularly condominiums and multifamily situations.


-
 
 Part of it is that we have a limited supply of single family homes because they have not increased rapidly.


Commissioner Lee


-
 
 A couple of requests: 
 
one involves my greater interest in Director Rahaim's comments in the SPUR monthly newsletter.
 
 I want to ask Director Rahaim if he can provide to the Commission, from time to time, your perception on some of the things that the Commission and staff have not looked into.


-
 
 I'd also like to request that staff and the City Attorney's Office review DR procedure.
 
 In the mid 90's, there was a process where only four commissioners would take DR. 
 
Is there another way to have a sub-committee for DR's because it takes so much time?


-
 
 We put a lot of money in the Matrix report. 
 
I would like to have from you your sense of what we can do with the Matrix report. 
 
Because of priorities and budget issues, I would like to get a sense what the Mayor's Office is going to provide you, the department, and the Commission to implement the Matrix report and if there is anything we can do to be helpful.


-
 
 A week and a half ago the Mayor's Office of Economic Development had an economic conference in Chinatown.
 
 I'd like to ask the City Attorney's Office what the process would be if we decide to start looking at the rezoning of the Chinatown.


Commissioner Sugaya


-
 
 55 Laguna Street with respect of the mitigation monitoring program: 
 
can we get at some point how staff is looking at implementing that particular plan?


Commissioner Moore


-
 
 I have a question for Director Rahaim. 
 
With our limited resources, or staff resources, the backlog for the Commission, and major policy projects in front of us, why do projects already in the initial stages requiring height reclassification, already have neighborhood opposition before they are in front of us, but they are encouraged to do EIRs?


-
 
 I am talking here about a project on Van Ness and Filbert.
 
 Why are we encouraging these types of projects to go into EIR knowing full well where they are going?


Director Rahaim


-
 
 My understanding is that we are required to review the project and to process it f they file an Environmental application and pay the fee even if does not meet the current zoning because they can apply for a zoning change.
 
 We are legally obligated to proceed if the sponsor requests it.


Commissioner Moore


-
 
 Are the hours that staff anticipates to spend on this project anywhere near that of what it costs to apply for such a process?


Director Rahaim


-
 
 Certainly on the Environmental Review, our cost is covered by the project fee.
 
 That is why the fees are as high as they are.


Zoning Administrator


-
 
 They would also have to apply for a conditional use and/or reclassification/rezoning. 
 
We have the ability to charge time and materials if our costs exceed the base fee.


-
 
 But if they want to apply, we have the obligation to review their application.

 DIRECTOR'S REPORT

 Director's Announcements


 


John Rahaim, Director


-
 
 Yesterday I did visit with the Chinatown Community Development Center and had a very interesting discussion with their staff about the issues they see in the neighborhood.
 
 I actually took a tour of the neighborhood through their eyes.


-
 
 One of the issues was whether we should be looking at some planning work around the central subway stations.
 
 I am going to explore that because it seems to be a good idea.


-
 
 About the Matrix report, we are looking at coming to you early to mid June with our initial responses to the Matrix report.
 
 There would be short, mid, and longer term efforts that we will be undertaking to improve the procedural process in the department.
 
 DR procedure is one of the things that we want to look at to be in the short or mid term.


-
 
 Next week we will have an early special hearing at 11a.m. to look at PDR replacement.


Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator


-
 
 We had originally budgeted to take on the DR process as part of the Matrix. 
 
We were going to try early.
 
 As a matter of fact, I was going to start during this hearing to read the 2001 report and start pulling together those ideas to report to the Planning Commission.
 
 I think we do have a range of options.


-
 
 As you know, we are in a general advertising review process.
 
 Proposition G was passed and we were founded to do a survey. 
 
We did the survey and we were ahead of the process and expected to be done about this time.


-
 
 Since January we have been in enforcement mode on the general advertising signs --sending out violations.


-
 
 We have, so far, 59 signs removed and we had our first hearing in front of the Administrative Law Judge last month.
 
 We did not fair very well at the beginning because it was staff against some very well versed lawyers.


-
 
 There was opportunity for further submittals and yesterday the judge released his findings on a case on Folsom Street, which we won with a $50,000 fine, the removal of the billboard and the award of administrative cost to us and the City Attorney.


-
 
 Staff has done an outstanding job, particularly Jonathan Purvis, Kimberly Durandet, Daniel Sider, Elaine Forbes and the City Attorney.


-
 
 The other point I want to let you know about is the Action List. 
 
There will be a response to Commissioner Lee's request about restaurants and the expediting process in next week's packet.
 
 I believe the Hospital's memorandum is in today's packet.

– 
Passed.


D-
 
 
1575 South Van Ness
 
– This was a conditional use that you took a 3 to 3 vote on.
 
 In the absence of positive action, the case is in effect disapproved.
 
 Staff drafted a memorandum reflecting what we thought a resolution of disapproval would say.
 
 The Board 
Overturned the disapproval with conditions:
 to revoke the conditional use permit for up to three years if the conditions are not met, maintenance of the building, signs to be reviewed and approve by Planning Department before installation, street trees, all equipment shall conform to the noise ordinance, project sponsor shall provide information to the department in connection to the neighborhood impacts from the project.


 


Board of Appeals


 


A-
 
 
1060 Gilman Avenue
 
– Previous permit in 2004 to build a new three story building in a vacant lot. 
 
There was a DR filed and the Commission took DR and denied the project.
 
 The property was sold and the new owner submitted a permit in 2006, which was exactly the same as the previous one. Staff should have brought that project to the Commission but there was no clarity on that.
 
 We will put in writing the procedure for cases like this.
 
 
Continued to June giving the opportunity for the project sponsor, staff and DR requestor to work on the design.

Informational Presentation of Public Artwork -
 On April 28, 2005 the Commission adopted Motion 16997 approving a mixed use building at the site. The conditions of approval of this Motion include a Public Artwork requirement pursuant to Code Section 149. The conditions of approval also require that the final art concept and location be submitted for review by, and be satisfactory to the Director of the Planning Department in consultation with the Commission. This site is within the C-3-S Zoning District, and a 200-S Height and Bulk District.


 


SPEAKER(S)


Richard, Artist


-
 
 There was a rich history on Folsom Street. 
 
It had been developed early on with vineyards and stables prior to 1849. 
 
It changed hands relatively few times in history.


-
 
 Along with the content of the artwork, it has to do with the conditions of the site. 
 
Being the darker side of the building, we are trying to brighten the area choosing white marbles.


-
 
 We are adjacent to the AT&T Plaza and we want to welcome the neighbors with equal views from the Folsom Street side and the AT&T Plaza side. 
 
In a sense, we are joining the Plaza and bringing a water feature to the artwork.

Request for an exemption pursuant to Section 309 to add 52 off-street parking spaces to the previously approved 64 off-street parking spaces in a mixed-use building currently under construction -
 The building is to have 114 dwelling units, each containing at least two bedrooms and at least 1000 square feet. Under this proposal there will be a total of 116 off-street parking spaces, 108 of which will be stored and accessed by mechanical stackers. Two of the spaces will be dedicated to car-share vehicles.

 Disapproval

SPEAKER(S)


Alice Barkley, Project Sponsor Representative


-
 
 
When this project was approved in 2004, there was an extremely high demand for housing of any kind.


-
 
 
There is a substantial increase of families living in that area and the project is definitely designed to be family friendly.


-
 
 
Project Sponsor had paid the 10% in-lieu fee and has volunteered and agreed to conditions of approval, if the Commission approves the application, to pay the difference between the 10% to 12% inclusionary requirement fee which is approximately $750,000.

-
 
 
It is not realistic for families in the South of Market to not have a car.
 
 You need to give the families the tools to actually live and stay there.

Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit Application
#200702053372 to extend the rear of an existing, first and second-level and add a partial third level, and relocate the garage door from the rear to the front, of a single-family dwelling within an RH-1(D) (Residential, House, One-Family, Detached) District, within the Westwood Park Residential Character District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project.


 


SPEAKER(S)


Anita Theoharis, Discretionary Review Requestor


-
 
 
As discussed in our initial submission, the primary purpose behind the creation of the RCD was to protect the neighborhood's character by prohibiting vertical expansion.


-
 
 
The Discretionary Review analysis fails to contain any meaningful analysis of the impacts of this type of development in the neighborhood as a whole, rebuttal of our design review conclusion, and to directly reverse the choice mandated by Planning Code Section 244.1


-
 
 
The whole purpose of Code 244.1 was to make Westwood Park subject to a separate set of rules and intended to avoid the uniquely detrimental impacts vertical additions could have on the RCD.


(-)David Melamed


-
 
 The vertical addition will impact the light on our yard.


(-)Robert Geleta


-
 
 Requested looking at this project and go by the guidelines.


(-)Kurt Meinhardt


-
 
 Westwood Park is a unique neighborhood and its design guidelines were set up to address vertical addition impacts.


(-)Greg Morris


-
 
 We have tried to capture, as a document for our neighborhood, the work that has gone to preserving the neighborhood.
 
 [Showed photos]


(-)Hugh Byrne


-
 
 92% of all of homes in Westwood Park are one story or one story over basement and it is a well preserved neighborhood.


(-)Kathy Betiks


-
 
 My hope is that you would approve our efforts to save it from the potential destruction of its architectural and historical heritage.


(-)Caryl Ito


-
 
 Urged to reject the proposed vertical addition because of the neighborhood's uniqueness being family friendly.


(-)Geoff Williams


-
 
 There are valuable reasons to preserve the neighborhood and not allowing vertical additions can even help global warming using natural daylight.


(-)Anne Chen


-
 
 We sent out a letter last Friday about this project and we have received 200 replies representing 400 residents opposing this project.


(-)Clyde Theriot


-
 
 As a resident of Westwood Park, I am urging you to take discretionary review.


 


 


(-)Stephen Theoharis


-
 
 244.1 say that the general guidelines are now amended by the Westwood Park Guidelines, which is un-rebutted, to avoid vertical addition.


(-)Greg Clinton


-
 
 The legislative intent was that when an extension is desired, it should go out or down but not up to preserve the neighborhood's character.


Joseph Railla, Project Architect


-
 
 The Westwood Park Association's concern is that there are some 100 1-story left out of the track of 685 houses and predominantly they are 2-story houses.


-
 
 Another concern is the uniformity of building height and massing that accentuates the low density of single family homes.
 
 San Francisco is a vertical and diverse city.


-
 
 The house would be only 3 feet – 2 inches higher than the up-hill neighboring house and there would be no impact to light and air because there is no encroachment into the rear yard.


(+)Sululagi Palega


-
 
 The addition is to accommodate the family and what we need to preserve is the people that live in San Francisco to maintain its diversity.
 
 [Submitted letters of support]


(+)Bernice Cole, Owner


-
 
 Originally, we sent out notification to the immediate neighbors and when it was brought to our attention, we requested an eight week extension to work with the neighborhood.


-
 
 The project is to accommodate our family.


(+)Shawn Nicholson


-
 
 
The guidelines indicate that not all vertical expansions are intended to be excluded.


-
 
 
I think we have to consider modest vertical extensions that are in line with the historic significance of the neighborhood.


(+)Jenny Morrison


-
 
 
The neighborhood has changed and families should be encouraged to stay and not to leave.


(+)Jeff


-
 
 
I support the project because it is a modest extension and a horizontal addition is not a good idea because of the loss of the shared open space [small park for children]


 


ACTION:
 
 
Took Discretionary Review and approved horizontal addition but disapproved the vertical addition.
 
 Encouraged architects on both sides to explore possible further horizontal expansion to the south side and rear yard.

Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project.


 


SPEAKER(S)


Lynn Grano, Discretionary Review Requestor


-
 
 
This project does not rehabilitate the historic structure. 
 
It merely saves the faÃ§ade.


-
 
 
Contrary to the General Plan, it does not preserve/conserve the existing housing character in this neighborhood made up of single family dwellings and 2 to 3 unit apartment buildings.


-
 
 
If you are inclined to grant the permit, I would suggest putting a condition that some of the units be affordable.


-
 
 
It would impact street parking, privacy and open space.

WESTERN SOMA CITIZEN PLANNING TASK FORCE STRATEGIC ANALYSIS MEMOS (SAMs)
 
- The first of three informational presentations of the Western SoMa Strategic Analysis Memos - This initial presentation covers the analysis of 
Housing
 changes in the Western SoMa Special Use District since the adoption of the South of Market General Plan Element in 1989.
 
 In addition, the Western SoMa Citizens Planning Task Force will describe the analytical tools created to evaluate appropriate new housing development locations in the Western SoMa Special Use District.
 
 Finally, the work undertaken by the Task Force and the owner of the 8th and Harrison Streets project site will discuss lessons learned and insights gained during a two year working relationship to shape a forthcoming development proposal for a mix of uses on a three acre parcel.

th
 and Harrison Streets for land use alternatives]


Jim Meko, Chair of Western SoMa CitizenTask Force


-
 
 It just made so much sense to us to do it this way and help you understand this community before we set out changes.


-
 
 We just want a plan that works and that the entire neighborhood can embrace.


Tobby Levy


-
 
 
We want to embrace developments that preserve people and uses that are existing in the area.


Marc Solomon


-
 
 We need to have a balance between what the people want and what the developers want to build and hope that what we are doing in the Western SoMa is going to help do that.


Anthony


-
 
 Being on the task force has been a real joy because we are very reasonable people and we have brought up very good things in a cooperative way.


Keith Silva


-
 
 
I have been following the task force and it is doing a great job.


Scott Kipper


-
 
 
I really enjoy the process of integrating developers with the community as well as the City being involved.


Bob Meyers


-
 
 
The task force has been doing a lot of work and I suggest that the subway be discussed more in Planning, and that the concept of increase density in heights where appropriate along 4
th
 Street be included in the Western SoMa.
