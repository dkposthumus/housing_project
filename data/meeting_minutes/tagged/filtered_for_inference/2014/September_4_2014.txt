Commissioner Wu:


 
I just wanted to welcome Commissioner Richards. We’re happy to have you join us here. 
 


Commissioner Antonini:


Welcome to Commissioner Richards. During our break, my wife and I took a trip, for about a week, to Chicago and we saw a lot of baseball and a lot of rain, but there were a lot of things that we didn’t see, which actually was very enlightening. We were out between seven in the morning and sometimes until midnight, so we got a good idea of their equivalent of the financial district, which for them is the Loop and their equivalent of our shopping area and hotel area, Union Square, which is, in their case, Michigan Avenue as well as a lot neighborhoods, that would be the equivalent of our Castro or South of Market, and a lot of parks, Lincoln and Grant, as well as a lot transit rides up to Wrigley Field and
  
a lot of other parts of Chicago. And, it was really nice that we didn’t see any trash on the sidewalks. The sidewalks were pretty clean. There was no graffiti, that I saw, and although there were panhandlers and we know Chicago has some significant problems in some areas, which you hear about, I didn't see a single person passed out on the street or sleeping in a doorway or anything so, and this was true of the parks and the transit too. So, although we know that Chicago has challenges it seems like at least in the most visible areas of the city they seem to be doing something right and it wouldn't hurt if we probably consulted with the people in Chicago and see what their policies are in regards to some of the issues that I brought up. I also would like to ask that we adjourn today in memory of Rashawn Williams. For those who have not heard, he was a young man, 14-year-old who was stabbed to death, just because he was going to a candy store and some person, who knew him and didn’t like him, resorted to stabbing him and it was fatal. And he was a promising young man who risen from a challenging background, to have straight A’s. He was an athlete and he had been accepted at Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory and it’s just a tragedy, and we need to eliminate the culture of violence, but that being said, I think, I would like to memorialize him as we adjourn our meeting.

140381 Administrative, Planning Codes - Amending Regulation of Short-Term Residential Rentals and Establishing Fee.
  
Chiu.
  
Supervisor Chiu reintroduced his amended Short-Term Rental Ordinance.
  
The revised Ordinance has several changes, which staff is still in the process of evaluating.
  
Some of the more obvious changes include including single-family homes, excluding SROs and other affordable housing units, and placing the Planning Department in charge of the enforcement and management of the short-term rental program.
  
It does not require rental platforms to report the number of days a unit has been rented, and leaves out other key enforcement recommendations from the Planning Commission.
  
We should have a more comprehensive understand of the revised ordinance in the next couple of days.
  
This Ordinance is scheduled to be heard at the Land Use Committee on September 15.

1333 GOUGH STREET/1481 POST STREET PROJECT
 - south side of Post Street between Gough and Laguna Streets on Lot 37 in Assessor Block 697 - 
Public Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Report
. The project entails demolition of a parking structure and construction of a 36-story, 398-foot-tall (416-foot-tall to roof of penthouse) 437,500-gsf residential building west of the existing 1333 Gough Street building on the project site. The proposed building would contain a café on the ground-floor and 262 dwelling units on floors 2 through 36 above. The project also includes renovation of an existing fitness center at 1333 Gough Street including construction of an 8,000-gsf indoor swimming pool addition fronting on Geary Boulevard. Pedestrian access to the project site would be provided from Post and Geary Streets. A 10-foot-wide publicly accessible walkway would facilitate mid-block pedestrian passage through the project block between Post Street and Geary Boulevard. The project also includes construction of a 442-space, 180,000-gsf subsurface parking garage with two freight loading spaces. Vehicular access would be from two driveways on Post Street and one driveway on Gough Street. The project site is in a RM-4 (Residential, Mixed, High Density) Use District and 240-E Height and Bulk District. The proposed project would require map and text amendments to reclassify the site’s existing height district to 410 feet. The project also requires modifications to a Planned Unit Development and Conditional Use authorization by the Planning Commission.
