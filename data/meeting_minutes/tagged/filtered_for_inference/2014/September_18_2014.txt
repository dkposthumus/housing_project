Commissioner Antonini:


A couple of things, last night I was able to go to see a preview of the renovated Masonic Auditorium. It had been before us and it was approved, as you know, and I think it was very well done and as we had mentioned during our discussions and as I voted, ultimately had been mostly to improve the facility, which I think in my opinion they did and made it a lot more functional. The other item I wanted to mention, I hope many of you have been able to watch Ken Burns’ excellent series on PBS Channel 9, on the Roosevelt’s, which is going to have its fifth night, tonight. I have seen three of the four nights and I think it's extremely well done, and from the histories I have read over the period, it seems to be very accurate and the nice thing about it is they don't hesitate to mention the warts, that is, the times when these individuals did things that might not have been the best or not made the best decisions. In any case, it is very important in the formation of the America we know today, the period of time characterized by both Presidents, Teddy Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt and of course Eleanor Roosevelt also is featured extensively in there. And the second episode ended with one of my favorite quotes by then President Theodore Roosevelt at the Sorbonne in 1905, the quote is known as, "It is not the critic that counts,” but basically what Roosevelt was saying to his audience is, it’s the one, the man in the arena, as he puts it, the one who is actually doing the deeds and risking his life and doing the best he can to do good is the one who really should get the credit not the person who just criticizes, and doesn’t offer any constructive criticism or anything in replace of what is being proposed and the job that’s being done by as he says, the man in the arena. I think it's one of my favorite quotes and it was a fitting ending to the second episode. 


Commissioner Moore:


I’d like to ask the Director; if at all possible, the Commission received a letter from Perkins and Coie, who are now representing the Academy of Art, giving the Commission an update on the Academy. I believe that that update is a little thin relative to the detail many of us have spent on it over the years and I do think the public, just as well as, the Commission deserves a slightly more detailed update because we have asked more detailed questions. The second point is in yesterday's e-mail I received a wonderful copy of San Francisco Heritage with a draft on the Cultural History of the City. It takes, like snapshots of particular events and buildings and places. I understand the Historic Preservation Commission had a presentation by Heritage. I am wondering if we could have a similar presentation, because ultimately we at least should know -- while it does not influence what we do, it gives us a broader understanding of the larger issues which tie it all together. Would you consider that to be possible, Director Rahaim? 


Director Rahaim:


Absolutely, we can work with the Chair to make that happen.


Commissioner Moore:


Thank you.


 


Commissioner Richards:


I guess parlaying off what Commissioner Moore said, I too was pleasantly surprised to receive these documents from San Francisco Heritage in the mail. I think, you know, we look at preservation through kind of a physical environment lens, the style of architecture, how old the building is, and maybe what happened there, but from a cultural point of view we have a little bit of catching up to do. I know the Gay and Lesbian Context Statement was adopted more than ten years ago. I know that there was an African American Context Statement that was adopted and I know it’s in the works to have a Latino Context Statement that’s coming, and I think, part of what makes San Francisco the wonderful place it is, is the social and cultural heritage that we have, and case in point, if you go online and look at the Heritage booklet on sustaining our living history, some of the most recent kind of things that have been publicized around changes in the social and cultural heritage started with the Pied Piper Bar and I think Commissioner Antonini, you could probably speak to that. That kind of started the ball rolling, on well wait a minute, if we had the Pied Piper go away and the Golden Dust Lounge go away and the Tonga Room go away, what is San Francisco going to look like? We had The Eagle go away which is a leather bar South of Market, went away for two years, it’s come back, that’ great, Esta Noche in the Mission is gone, the Roxy Theater’s lease is up for renewal, I know Sam Wo is gone, they were there 100 years, Marcus Books is gone, and now the The End Up, which has been around, if you ever read 
Tales of the City
, probably 40 years now, it ‘s a fixture in the nightlife scene in the South of Market, their building is up for sale.
  
So, I really think that getting our arms around what we can do strategically to prevent displacement for these kinds of businesses is good. And, actually on the back of one of the pamphlets, they talk about strategies that they would like to implement, that's why I would like them to also come to the Commission. The second thing I wanted to mention is, I asked Director Rahaim and staff if they could produce, I guess a pro forma in the pipeline report for the housing coming online. We keep referring to the income levels of
  
housing, above moderate, is 120% of AMI, moderate is 80-120%, and then low income, lower than 80.
  
I’ve only been here two meetings, we've had some discussion around what kinds of BMR units they are going to be, folks in the Mission want 55% or less or even lower than that. We hear that there is a big gap in the moderate income units to the point of, that we only produced about a quarter of what we need. And low income on 61 percent and we’re way above moderate, at about 200 percent. I asked Director Rahaim if he could actually take a look at and maybe eyeball, for the 4,000 units coming, beyond 2014 in Hunters Point, Treasure Island and Park Merced, to give us an idea of what the world would look with those projects online. Would it move any of these numbers significantly or are we still, basically operating with the same deficit foundation in the low and moderate? I look forward to receiving that. My last point is, I struggle with the last two meetings with definition of family housing. I came across something on Twitter two days ago that what was retweeted by San Francisco Business Times and it was the First Republic Luxury Home Index. It kind of opened my eyes to, wow, this is what we are kind of dealing with. The luxury home defined by First Republic, and I’m sure that there’s other barometers out there, is a home that’s valued at $3 million, it has three or more bedrooms, and it has 3,000 or more square feet.
  
You can fit a family in that, of course, you can fit a family in a size less than that, but I think for my purposes and my lens moving forward, I'm going to call that definition a luxury family house, anything less than that would be family housing. So, the 26
th
 and Clement we had called into a definition of what a family housing really would be. The 115 Telegraph Hill certainly is a luxury family house. That's kind of the lens I'm going to start looking at. If you want to refer to it, it’s the First Republic Luxury Home Index, it’s online. Thank you.


Commissioner Johnson:


Thank you very much. My first point here, I was thinking about this since our first meeting and would really like to request starting with a presentation from SFMTA. I would like to see how, starting with at least, starting how they are going to phase in the transportation improvements particularly in the area encompassed by the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan and eventually what will encompass the new Central SOMA Plan. We talk a lot about, there is a lot of maps of what the future state will look like, future, future, but I would like to understand what the phasing is going to look like and how that is going to come in over time, and how they are actually measuring when one phase is completed and when you need to move to the next phase in terms of density, in terms of intensification of various MUNI lines. I would like to have at least an informational presentation on that and potentially maybe in the future we can move to maybe a joint meeting or some other method of having a little bit more coordination between the Planning Department and SFMTA. My second one, is so minor, I almost hate myself for saying it. I noticed in our last few hearings when we had DR's, when it came time for comment that oftentimes individuals who technically are part of the project sponsor team, either they are co-owner of the property or they are related to the owner of the property or there is a very close relation would come up for comment and be confused as to why they couldn't speak because they should have been considered part of the project sponsor team. You are always going to have people who are unfamiliar with how the Planning Commission works, maybe they haven’t come to a hearing before, so we are going to have to deal with that, but I think that one thing we could make a little bit easier is in our agendas we have standard language underneath the regular calendar that talks about the project sponsor team 
includes,
 colon, and then it lists off a few things. One of the first ones says the sponsor or their designee and I’d like to find a way to maybe add another clause that just clarifies who else would be considered part of the sponsor team, so if you have an ownership interest in the property or some sort of clarifying language I think that would be helpful. I wasn't going to say it the first couple of times, but then it happened a few more times and I want people to understand when they can make comment, what group they should be a part of, who they should be communicating with, so they are not confused when they get here. Thank you. 


Commissioner Wu:


I think that's something we can work on with the Commission Secretary. 


Jonas Ionin, Commission Secretary:


If there is nothing further we can move on but, just quickly to respond to Commissioner Johnson. The Historic Preservation Commission just yesterday adopted new rules and regulations for their procedures, and as a part of that Commissioner Johns is actually working with staff on a handout that would go along with how to make a public presentation and what to expect. Maybe we can adopt something similar for the Planning Commission that could be a part of applications that go out to applicants.

Director’s Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


Thank you. Good Afternoon, Commissioners, just two things. With respect to the Academy of Art, we will be happy to prepare a more detailed memo on the status.
  
Just so you do know, we are on track for the release of the Draft EIR in November, which has been the kind of date that we've been working toward for quite a few months. Secondly, I wanted to just let you know that we are working with the Office of Economic and Workforce Development and the developer of the Flower Mart. There has been a lot in the media about this; there has been a lot discussion in the community about this. There is no architectural design that is yet proposed but, but we believe it’s possible given the size of the site to fully maintain a Flower Mart on that site.
  
The developer is willing to work with us on this. Further, the Mayor has directed the Office of Economic and Workforce Development to work with us and the developer to ensure that the Flower Mart is actually maintained on site, with any new development that is there.
  
We are very early on the process; they haven't even applied for their Preliminary Plan Assessment yet, but we will soon be working with them when they do make that application to ensure the Flower Mart does, in fact, stay on site. We anticipate that it's physically possible to do that. 
 
We will let you know as the applications come in, over the next twelve months or so on the status of that.
  
That concludes my presentation. Happy to take any questions.

Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission


 


LAND USE COMMITTEE: 


·
         
Short-Term Rentals. 
Commissioners, you heard this item on August 7.
  
At that time you recommended approval with 16 amendments be made to the legislation
[1]
. These requested changes were delivered to the Board.
  
At the land use hearing, the Director emphasized the shared goal of created a legal avenue for this use and thanked the Supervisor for taking on this challenging issue.
  
At the same time, the Director emphasized the need to focus on three key changes:
  
1) Ensure that the system is not abused by creating real limits on the number of days a unit can be rented.
  
2) Dedicated budget for enforcement staff. And 3) Limits for hosted units too.
   
There was about 7 hours of
  
public comment.
  
A representative from one hosting platform, AirBNB, came to the hearing and addressed the Board. 


 


As part of the Board discussions, there were Significant amendments were made to the V2 ordinance.
  
Supervisor Chiu introduced 8 amendments which were incorporated into the ordinance.
  
(person can only have 1 perm. residence, only 1 registrant per unit, suspend permission if there is an outstanding Code violation—until violation is cured, posting ads w/o registration is a violation, need a valid business registration, hosting platform shall maintain record of tax payment—not maintaining these records is a violation by the platform, hosting platform can respond to alleged violations at the administrative hearing).
  
Supervisors Wiener (in consultation w/ Farrell) amended the ordinance to require that the Planning Department shall send mailed notice to the property owner when a resident applies for the registry.
  
Supervisor Kim amended the ordinance to add the HOA (if any) related to the unit to the interested parties list who are eligible to sue. The Committee orally amended the Ordinance to limit the rentals to 265 every year and not just the year prior to getting on the registry.


 


Supervisor Kim stated that she wanted to create a 90-day limit for both hosted and non-hosted units.
  
She was interested in the funding to support the program and wanted to hear about how DBI’s codes would come into play.
  
Supervisor Chiu offered to bring the DBI director to a LU hearing the next week, but Supervisor Kim felt more time would be needed to resolve the outstanding questions.
  
She referenced the 16 modifications of this commission.
  
Supervisor Cohen suggested a two-week continuance and the committee voted to reconsider the issue on September 29.

BOARD OF APPEALS:


Zoning Administrator Scott Sanchez: 


The Board of Appeals did meet last night. One item that might be of interest to the Commission is
 
70 Crestline. This was before you as a Discretionary Review at the end of 2012. It was staff initiated. Staff had recommended denial of the application. The Commission approved it. It was for new construction of a 4-unit building in Twin Peaks. Subsequently to that, the neighbors who were opposed to the project appealed it to the Board of Appeals. The Board of Appeals denied the application. There was some question about whether or not there were some limitations associated with the subdivision that established this property back in 1962 and Public Works had issued a condition saying that you could not build on this area. They subsequently revoked that and asked the Planning Department and Building Department to look into it further. We researched that and actually did find evidence through minutes from 1962 Planning Commission hearings which did indicate that this was to be maintained as open space.
  
So, we conditioned the subdivision, as such, that was issued earlier this year and it was not appealed to the Board of Supervisors, as such conditions could be. So those conditions are in full effect. Last night was a rehearing request brought by the project sponsor. The Board’s noting that these conditions are in place and that they had previously denied the permit, denied the rehearing request, so their denial of the application stands and the project could not move forward. I'm available for any questions. 


HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:


Preservation Coordinator Tim Frye:


Good afternoon, Commissioners, Tim Frye, here to share with you the results of yesterday's Historic Preservation Commission hearing. To begin though, I do want to mention that Commissioner President Hasz appointed two members to a 
Cultural Heritage Assets Subcommittee
 at yesterday’s hearing
.
  
Commissioners Hyland and Matsuda will form that Committee. I'm sure if we asked the Commission they would be delighted to have a member of the Planning Commission as part of that Subcommittee. They intend on meeting over the next month and provide specific recommendations how the Department and the Commissions can implement some of the recommendations in the San Francisco Architectural Heritage White Paper on Cultural Heritage Assets, but we are happy to relay the information to the Commission, if this Commission does want to participate in that Subcommittee. The hearing started with a meeting of the Architectural Review Committee. They reviewed the design for the Van Ness BRT that's going to run in front of City Hall and in the portion located within the Civic Center Landmark District. As you are probably aware, the Historic Preservation Commission, as well as, the Civic Design Review Committee of the Arts Commission is reviewing the design for the public realm improvements and platforms proposed by MTA as part of Van Ness BRT. There are still several meetings, design review meetings that need to take place before either Committee or either Commission make a final recommendation and we'll keep you posted on those results. Ultimately though, the Commissioners, the Design Review Committee was supportive of the project. They did request some more information in particular around replacement trees, minimizing some of the details of the platforms. They had some questions about the canopy structures and the wind screens. We will be preparing a memo of the Architectural Review Committee’s recommendations. If you are interested we can certainly forward you a copy as well. The Commission then moved on to approve several Certificates of Appropriateness.
  
Several were located in Liberty Hill Landmark District, one in the Alamo Square Landmark District, and one in the Jackson Square Landmark District. All were approved as recommended by staff. Finally, Preservation staff gave an overview of all Planning Code incentives related to preservation. It was more of an informational presentation to set the stage for the review of Supervisor Cohen's legislation regarding PDR conversion to office in landmark properties. Ultimately, during the discussion of the proposed legislation, the HPC continued the item to its October 2
nd
 hearing. In the interim they are interested in providing a letter to this Commission for your consideration, just so you know some of the thoughts going on in their heads about how they believe the legislation could be more effective. Some of the questions they still have and staff is working on some response right now is, they want to be as useful as possible to the Zoning Administrator, Department
  
staff, and this Commission as the final deciders on whether or not this PDR space should be converted to office. They do have some questions about process. They do want to have a better idea of what's expected to them and they discussed how they could provide some criteria so they are able to discuss the merits of proposals for buildings and really how these buildings could be rehabilitated provided that the PDR is converted to office. Like I said, we'll be providing this Commission a letter before your hearing on the item on October 2
nd
 and they’ll be having a discussion the day before to provide you some more robust recommendations on how they think they can be more effective in that process. Finally, just to let you know, at the beginning of the summer we presented an overview of the Draft Preservation Element as part of the General Plan. The HPC spent the entire summer reviewing the Draft Preservation Element. We had our open house at the Old Mint last week. We had a great turnout; there were about 50 participants, a lot of folks providing great recommendations on how to make that part of the General Plan an effective document. We had various organizations, neighborhood organizations, SPUR, the National Trust and the Presidio Trust attended. There were a variety of preservation and design firms that participated and we are still continuing to receive written comments. Once we have compiled those comments, we will certainly forward them to you, as well as, the HPC before we bring that to you for adoption, we believe in early 2015. That concludes my comments to you and I'm happy to entertain any questions. Thank you.
