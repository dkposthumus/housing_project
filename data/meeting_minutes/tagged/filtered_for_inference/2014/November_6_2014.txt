Commissioner Antonini:


I can’t go, let the day pass without making some positive remarks about the Giants, but not just that they won the World Series, but their motto was “Giant Together,” and I think it was very appropriate. If you listen to the parade and the speeches, very many of the players and others not only just thanked the fan base, but thanked the City of San Francisco and the people of San Francisco specifically, and they do typify a group that is part of the community. As you know, many of the players live in the City during the season, as does Bochy and Sabean, right by, so they are around, you see them and they do, they’re an active part of San Francisco, so that’s really gratifying to see and I think that part of the, it’s a symbiotic relationship between the fans and the people and the team, when you have that kind of relationship. So, a wonderful event and certainly very well done on part of the team and all concerned.

, so we are two weeks into it. It seems to be working well so far and I think Director Rahaim will give a further report at the next meeting, but I just wanted to report that. It’s been years in the making and it’s nice to see that is finally up and running.

LAND USE COMMITTEE:


There were no items concerning the Planning Code or Planning Department at the Land Use hearing this week, however there were several items at last week’s Committee hearing.


10/27/14


·
         
130788 and 140844 Planning Code - Formula Retail and Large-Scale Retail Controls.
  
Sponsor: Department and Supervisor Mar.
  
Supervisor Mar sponsored the Planning Commission’s Ordinance with several amendments, while tabling his Ordinance.
  
By doing this he included many good government measures included in the Department sponsored legislation that are intended to reduce redundancies and ambiguity in the Code. 


·
         
The proposed amendments to the Department’s sponsored Ordinance included:


o
   
Retain the threshold number of 11


o
   
Codify the Upper Market NCT method for calculating FR concentrations for all CU 


o
   
Delete the requirement that the Economic Impact Study include an analysis of impacts to permanent employment in the impact area (on the advice of the econ consultant)


o
   
Require the Economic Impact Study for FR uses over 20,000 sf as part of FR CU, excepting grocery stores 


o
   
Require 30 day public notice for FR CUs


·
         
Supervisor Weiner made additional amendments to the Ordinance, which include:


o
   
Codify the requirement that staff recommend disapproval of FR application when the concentration is over 20% in the Upper Market NCT (this is currently Commission Policy and not codified)


o
   
Remove Business and Professional services from the list of FR uses


o
   
Reinitiate the CU requirement for Financial and Limited Financial service in the Castro NCD, Upper Market NCT and 24th Street – Noe NCD. (This change only impacted non FR uses.)


o
   
Added a grandfathering clause for any application made to the City prior to 10/24/14 to be under the old ordinance


·
         
The committee then duplicated the file and added 2 additional amendments to the duplicated file.
  
The duplicated file will come back to the Planning Commission for your review and consideration.
  
Those two amendments include: 


o
   
Making Supervisor Weiner’s subsidiary interim controls permanent – these controls require a CU when a business alters one or more features to be exempted from FR controls after the Department has already deemed it a FR Use; and


o
   
Exempting personal and financial services from FR if they are located at upper floors.


·
         
With that the item was sent to the full board with recommendation. 


 


·
         
120881 Planning Code, Zoning Map - Uses, Conformity of Uses, Parking Requirements for Uses, and Special Use Districts (Starr).
  
Otherwise known as the NE Ordinance, this Ordinance made a number of changes to parking, use, and sign controls primarily in the NE area of the city.
   
Portions of this Ordinance have already been adopted by the Board and integrated into the Planning Code, which some parts, such as sign controls and issues dealing with Port Property, have not been to the Land Use Committee yet.
  
The Ordinance that was before the Committee this week dealt the following issues:


o
   
Facilitating the conversion of historic buildings and nonconforming uses in existing buildings to housing. 


o
   
Updating the requirements for accessory uses in Commercial and Residential Commercial districts. 


o
   
Rationalizing chan ges of use in NC districts. 


o
   
Making parking requirements consistent in transit-rich certain districts of the city. 


o
   
Discouraging above ground parking and excess parking in the transit rich C-3 districts.


o
   
Modifying streetscape improvement requirements; and


o
   
Improving the organization of the Planning Code, and remove outdated provisions.


This Commission held multiple hearings on this Ordinance, eventually splitting up the 540 page Ordinance into 3 different phases.
  
The Commission heard the issues taken up by the LU Committee this week in May 2012 as part of Phases 2 and 3.  For both Ordinances, the Planning Commission voted to recommend approval of the ordinances with modification.  All of the Commission’s recommended modifications were incorporated in the revised Ordinance that was before the LU Committee this Monday.
  
At that hearing, there was no public comment and no questions or comments from the Committee members.
  
The Committee voted to recommend this item to the Full Board.

141006 Interim Zoning Controls 2nd Street Ground Floor.
  
This is a resolution imposed interim zoning controls that require conditional use authorization for new office uses facing 2nd Street, from King to Folsom Streets, for eighteen months.
  
As you are probably aware, this is as an interim control so the Ordinance will not before you for a recommendation.

120796 120814 141023 Divisadero Fillmore NCDs, and the Development Agreement for 181 Fremont Street,

120881 Planning Code, Zoning Map - Uses, Conformity of Uses, Parking Requirements for Uses, and Special Use Districts
.
  
The NE Ordinance passed its first read with no comment from the Supervisors.


·
         
140844 Planning Code - Formula Retail and Large-Scale Retail Controls.
  
At the Board, an additional amendment was introduced by Supervisor Weiner to clarify the grandfathering clause to be specific to complete applications made to the Planning Department. This was deemed a non-substantive change and the Ordinance was unanimously passed by the Board on First Reading.

 Continued to November 18


·
         
141068 Public Hearing - Appeal of Conditional Use Authorization - 431 Balboa Street.
 The Board did hear the CU appeal for 431 Balboa Street brought by residents regarding the Planning Commission’s approval of an AT&T Mobility macro Wireless facility.
  
Residents raised concerns similar to those raised during public testimony before the Planning Commission regarding potential health effects of RF emissions, whether the facility is needed to meet a gap in service, and the aesthetic effects of the antennas and screening measures. 


 


Residents and Supervisor Marr, whose district the facility is proposed in, raised further concerns regarding potential building code violations, how RF standards would affect surrounding properties and the effects of RF emissions on neighborhood restaurants, childcare centers and schools in the area. Residents also raised concerns regarding the notification process.


 


Lastly, Supervisor Marr discussed with staff and the Project Sponsor, deployment alternatives if the site was denied, to which staff provided examples of scenarios, such as the carrier choosing a similar preference, though lower building height location nearby, or as an alternate pursuing a wider number of antennas and equipment boxes within the public right of way on wooden poles where the City has more limited jurisdiction over siting and design. The carrier indicated their likely recourse would be litigation if the site was denied. Supervisor Marr made a motion to uphold the appeal and deny the CU, but the CU failed to obtain the supermajority required to overturn the Commission’s approval, with 5 votes in support. Though not required, a subsequent motion by Supervisor Farrell to approve the CU was ultimately approved by the Board with 6 votes in support.

1608 DOLORES STREET
 - the Request is for a 
Mandatory Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit Application No. 2013.11.27.3000. The proposal involves moving the front wall of the existing building forward, expanding the side walls to the side property line, adding a rear addition, and increasing the height by two-stories. The work is tantamount to demolition. The work will maintain the existing number of dwelling units (3 units), by reconfiguring floor plans to establish one unit per floor level. A three-car garage will be introduced at ground level. 
This action constitutes the Approval Action for the project for the purposes of CEQA, pursuant to Section 31.04(h) of the San Francisco Administrative Code.
