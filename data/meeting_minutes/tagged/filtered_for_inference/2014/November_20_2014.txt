Commissioner Antonini:


Just now we approved another of many condo conversions, which were allowed by legislation from last year, and that's the good news because many people who were, most of the time, unrelated and had been living in groups of - in this case 6 different units, sometimes 5 relying on each other to remain solvent and
  
to pay their parts of the shares worth in this unwieldy partnership with TIC were they are allow to convert, because they are all owners anyway, and most of these are entirely owner occupied and a few that have occasional renters within them so that's
  
is a good news, the bad news is part of the legislation, I think in my opinion, is contrary to some of the parts of general plan, because we should encourage affordable homeownership and TIC’s were one of the methods where people in this situation, could get into, often unrelated people, who would come together to buy a unit as a
  
group, as a tenants in common and get into the homeownership thing, which is something we should support because the more home ownership we have the less problem we have with people being displaced, I think, because even if someone does want to take over something that you own, they have to pay you for your property, so, I think,
  
it should be encouraged and it's just too bad that that’s the way this legislation came down because now they're not going to allow the conversion of 5 and 6 unit TIC’s, maybe, I am not sure about that and there’s a 10 year moratorium on the conversions of existing TIC’s is getting
  
into the loop, that often time is a 10 year wait. Anyway, it maybe something that in the future we can deal with to encourage people to pursue homeownership if possible.

Good afternoon Commissioners, just wanted to report, last night there was an

event, that I spoke
  
as part of
  
a panel on
  
Proposition M where the office allocation, I guess there was some confusion as to whether it was Prop M or actually 5M,
  
and the -- it was a discussion, Commissioner Richards actually attended last time, there was about a hundred people in attendance, I presented this, essentially the same presentation that staff presented to you a few weeks ago and there was a discussion amongst panel members about the effects of Prop M on what they perceived would be the effects would be on their office
  
development, and in the future of office development in the City and it was a fairly lively discussion very, very interesting group people who attended, so I just wanted to report on that.

Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission


                


LAND USE COMMITTEE:




·
        
140875 Ordinance Amending the Third Street Alcohol Restricted Use District.
  
This Ordinance seeks to exempt Small Beer Manufacturing from the prohibitions on establishing new on-sale and off-sale liquor establishments in the 3
rd
 Street Alcohol RUD.  Currently the Third Street Alcohol RUD prohibits new liquor stores, bars, and nightclubs serving liquor/alcohol without food service.
  
The Planning Commission heard the proposed Ordinance on October 23 and unanimously voted to recommend approval of the proposed Ordinance with modifications.  The Commission proposed modification was for the Board to consider requiring Conditional Use authorization for Small Beer Manufacturing.
  
On November 17 the Land Use Committee heard the proposed Ordinance.  The public comment was again favorable.  The Land Use Committee voted to move the Ordinance to the full Board of Sups with a favorable recommendation without requiring a CU for Small Beer Manufacturing.

·
         
141064 Public Hearing - Appeal of Conditional Use Authorization - 115 Telegraph Hill Boulevard.




·
        
This project includes the construction of a new three-unit residential building with three off-street parking spaces on a mostly vacant lot.
  
The project required a Conditional Use because it would result in 4 units on a property zoned RH-3.
  
The Commission heard the CU on September 11, 2014, and approved the CU with a 5-2 vote.
  
The appellants were appealing the CU because they believed that the Project does not meet Section 303 of the Planning Code, General Plan’s Priority Policies, the Residential Design Guidelines or the Urban Design Element and that the project does not comply with the Housing Element.
  
They also believed that the Planning Commission erred in determining that the existing rear yard building included only one unit and that the Planning Commission’s Conditions of Approval were inadequate to address the Project’s construction impacts.
  
The Board heard the Environmental appeal and the CU appeal together, there was a lot of testimony against the project, mainly around impacts on the neighborhood and views from the nearby open space, but there were also several members of the public that spoke in favor of the proposed project.
  
Supervisor Yee asked questions about the size of previously approved projects on the site as well as how many square feet the original housing on the site contained.
  
Supervisor Chiu asked for staff to clarify the point on public views and whether the project was consistent with the General Plans protection of public views, which Staff assured him it was.
    
The first vote was to uphold the Department’s Categorical Exemption for the project, which the Board did by a vote of 7 (Breed, Chiu, Cohen, Farrell, Tang, Wiener, Yee) to 3 (Avalos, Kim, Mar) with Supervisor Campos absent.
  
The second vote was to uphold the Commission’s CU decision, which the board did again by a vote of 7-3.
  
The motion included 11 additional conditions of approval added by Chiu that dealt with construction management, many of which were on the plans that the Commission Approved.
  
They also included a condition requiring the sponsor to consult with Garfield Elementary School and the School District prior to finalizing construction plans.




 


INTRODUCTIONS: 
There were no introductions this week. 


 


BOARD OF APPEALS:


The Board of Appeals did meet last night, one item of interest
  
to the Commission was the Discretionary Review you heard for the property back at 1264
  
6
th
 Avenue, you heard back at the end of April, the appellants in this case,
  
raised concerns about the compatibility of the proposed addition, which I think this Commission found to be modest, it was about a two foot extension overall for the building, the appellants argued that the building was not compatible with the neighborhood and
  
also that there were 
 
procedural issues and failures with the Planning Commission and how the DR hearing was processed. The Board of Appeals found there was no issues with the project, that it was compatible with the neighborhood, Commissioner Honda in particular, noted the diligence of this Planning Commission in reviewing and processing this discretionary review request, and the Board unanimously upheld the decision of the Commission not to take DR in the project,
  
the next meeting for the Board of Appeals will be on December 10
th
.


 


HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:


Good afternoon Commissioners, Tim Frye, Department staff, here to share with you, a couple of items from yesterday’s Historic Preservation Commission hearing. The Commission initiated landmark designation on two properties yesterday, the first is Swedish American Hall, located at 2168 to 2174 Market Street,
  
the Swedish American Hall
  
has been on the HPC landmark designation work program since 2011, we've been working very closely with the new tenants of Swedish American Hall
  
and also the Swedish Society to garner their support, and the designation report
  
was very well received, the HPC complimented staff on the thoroughness of the report and initiated the landmark designation based on events and architecture. Events because of the Swedish American Hall Building significance for its long-standing association with San Francisco Swedish and Scandinavian communities, and under architecture, as a architecturally significant work by master architect, August Nordeen. The next property that the HPC initiated landmark designation was 186 to 194 Gough Street, this is also known as the R.L. Goldberg Building, this was a community requested initiation, the two existing tenants requested that the HPC add this building to the landmark designation work program in June. As a result, they hired their own consultant to prepare the designation report and we presented the Department’s analysis and that designation at yesterday's hearing. The Commission also unanimously designated the landmark designation on this property as significant architecture expression of an early 20th Century mixed used classically inspired designed building.
  
The building is significant under architecture, which is Criterion C.
  
Both items will be heard at the December 17
th
 HPC hearing, where the Commission will finalize
  
its recommendation for the Board of Supervisors, which we believe they will take up the items early 2015, that concludes my comments.
