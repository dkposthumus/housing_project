Commissioner Wu:


I want to welcome Commissioner Johnson, she most recently comes to us as the Chair of OCII with a wealth of knowledge. I look forward to working with you.


 


 


Commissioner Moore:


Welcome Commissioner Johnson, delighted to have you. I’d like to tell you a story, which I hope will inspire Director Rahaim to do the same.
  
I read something in the paper, which really made me laugh, and that is, Supervisor Farrell sponsored a scholarship, two scholarships, each a thousand dollars for students of San Francisco State University to find outdated City laws, and I am sure Mr. Sanchez will be interested in this.
  
Students came forward with 30 laws, ranging from the City’s minimum wage to prohibitions on walking cats on leashes. However, Supervisor Farrell chose two students who identified two very, very funny laws. One that lets people apply for permits to keep cows on private lots and another one that requires all gas stations to provide separate restrooms for women and men. The one about the cows I thought was really outstanding, and I am encouraging Director Rahaim, with the summer students, to perhaps sponsor ongoing investigations.


 


Commissioner Johnson:


Hi, I feel like I should say something. I am really happy to be here. It is nice seeing all of you, I’ve gotten to know - I think some people I met five minutes ago, everyone else I met over the course of the appointment process. I am really excited to be here.


 


Commissioner Antonini:


I’d like to also welcome Commissioner Johnson, looking forward to working with her in the future. 
 
I want to just comment - - I was asked to speak before the Northeast Mission Business Association last night, very good group, very interesting group, but they raised a question that I wanted to bring to the attention of staff and it is one those ideas where maybe the left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing.
  
One of the speakers has a PDR property, which we’re trying to take care of PDR, and she was concerned, because her particular property, which is on 16
th
 Street, between Harrison and Folsom, which most of the properties are PDR properties. There is a plan, possibly to eliminate parking on the side of the street where her business is and the other PDR businesses are, at least for part of the day, and if that were to happen, they basically would be out of business because these businesses apparently don’t – aren’t big enough to have loading zones and a lot of their products and customers have to bring their goods to these businesses and the supplies that they need to produce their product and other things. So anyway, I think no decision has been made yet. They are trying to figure out how they are going to get a transit only lane down 16
th
, which makes sense to me, but one of the choices is eliminating one of the traffic lanes, another choice is eliminating the parking.
  
And, this particular individual said, yellow zones are not enough because a lot of their customers and suppliers are not - - particularly the customers are not necessarily commercial vehicles, so they would be unable to use the yellow zone. Anyway, something to look at, make sure that MTA considers the nature of the businesses, where they may be thinking of eliminating parking in a particular area to promote transit.

Director’s Announcements


                                


Director Rahaim:


Thank you. Good afternoon, Commissioners. I also want to welcome Commissioner Johnson on behalf of the Department, we look forward to working with you and please call on us as you need to understand the very lengthy and complex processes that we have and we’ll try to minimize the amount of paper we send you every week. Commissioners, I wanted to if you will allow me to take the time to introduce many of our summer interns who are here in the audience today. We have 19 interns this summer, many of them are here, maybe, I could ask you to standup, while I announced your names.
  
I know that not all 19 of you are here, but, and I don’t have – we don’t have the time to go through the backgrounds of each one, so I’ll just simply give you the names: Sophia Lai, Luke Norman, Arianna Urban, Melisa Ruhl, Nathalia Kwaitkowska, Nicole Jones, Andrew Doyle, Justin Panganiban, Kirby Olson, Amir Hajrasouliha, Emma Reed, Jonique Green, Esmeralda Jardines, Devin McCutchen, Binh Nguyen, Andrew Perry, Maria DeAlba, Megan Calpin, and Ada Tan. Most of you, I believe are here for a 10 week summer program. We welcome you to the Department. I am sure that we look forward to working with you and I also just want to take a moment to thank Tina Tam, who is the primary organizer of the summer internship who has done a fantastic job in organizing the program and – training the interns – giving them a range of experiences in the Department and in the City, so we welcome you for the summer.

Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission


 


LAND USE COMMITTEE: 


July 14


·
         
140235 Administrative Code - Information from Project Sponsors Regarding Their Anti-Discriminatory Housing Policies Sponsor: Campos
  
The Land Use Committee heard the proposed LGBT Anti-Discriminatory Housing Policies Ordinance.  The proposed Ordinance, introduced by Sup Campos, will amend the Planning Department application intake procedures to require the Planning Department collect an application requesting information from project sponsors of projects with at least 10 dwelling units about any internal policies they may have that prohibit discrimination against the LGBT community in the finance, sale or leasing of dwelling units.  The Planning Commission heard this item at its July 10, 2014 hearing.  The Commission voted 5-0 in favor of providing a recommendation of adoption to the Board of Supervisors.  Public comment at this meeting noted that the LGBT community continues to face discrimination in housing markets throughout the US and emphasized the importance and utility of the data that will be collected as a result of the proposed Ordinance in helping to remedy this situation. The Supervisor’s discussion of the proposed Ordinance was brief.  Only Supervisor Weiner commented.  He noted that the proposed Ordinance would provide valuable information and made common sense.   Supervisor Kim made a motion to move the proposed Ordinance to the Full Board and the motion was seconded by Sup Cohen.  


 


FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: 


July 15


·
         
140036 Dwelling Unit Density Bonus for Affordable Housing. Sponsor: Wiener, Cohen and Kim. 
Passed its Second Read


 


·
         
140593 Planning Code - Fee Elimination.
  
Sponsor: Mayor.
 This item eliminates four Planning Code fees.
  
The Ordinance passed its second read at the Board this week.


 


·
         
140675 General Plan and Planning Code Amendments for Visitation Valley/Schlage Lock.
  
These two items are intended to implement the Visitation Valley/Schlage Lock plan that was previously under the jurisdiction of the Redevelopment Agency. This ordnance came to the Planning Commission on May 8 of this year, which unanimously recommended approval. It was at Land Use on June 30th, where it was forwarded with recommendation.
  
This item passed unanimously on its first read as amended.
  
The amendments included an amendment to the Planning Code ordinance to say that the Ordinance would not become effective until the DA become effective, and the General Plan ordinance was amended to say that it will not become effective until the Planning Code ordinance becomes effective.
  
These amendments were done to ensure that all three ordinances would take effect at the same time. In particular, the Board did not want to end up with a situation in which the Planning Code and General Plan amendments were adopted without the DA being executed, in which case the Developer would get favorable rezoning without having committed to the increased public benefit commitments in the DA.


 


·
         
140645 Resolution of Intention - Establishing the Transbay Transit Center Community Facilities District Sponsors: Mayor, Kim.
  
The Board unanimously passed two resolutions relating to the Transbay CFD:


•
              
Resolution of Intention to Establish the Transbay CFD


•
              
Resolution of Intention to Incur Bonded Indebtedness up to $1.4 billion


This is the first of 3 legislative actions required to form the CFD – expected to be fully complete in December.


 


·
         
140413 General Plan - Amendments Related to the 2014 Update of the Recreation and Open Space Element.
 Sponsor: Department/Commission.
  
This Commission approved adoption of the ROSE on April 3 with a vote of 4-2. On its second read Supervisor Avalos joined Supervisor Wiener, Yee, and Campos voting no on this item, but the ROSE update did pass its final read at the Board on a vote of 7-4.

BOARD OF APPEALS:


Scott Sanchez
: 


The Board of Appeals did meet last night. A couple of items that might be of interest first would be a jurisdiction request for 399 Fremont Street. This was the project that the Planning Commission has approved several times over the years and extensions.
  
This was, again the project is about a 42-story building, with 152 units in Rincon Hill. The jurisdiction request was submitted by the Project Sponsor, and so there was a dispute regarding the fees that were calculated for the impact fees.
  
The permit was issued last June and they submitted the first construction document earlier this year. Under the Code you pay the fees that are in effect at the time you submitted the first construction document and fees are indexed annually on January 1
st
, so on January 1
st
 the fees did increase, and last year were $32 million and change and went up to about $33 million and change. The jurisdiction request, because they disputed that, we should be indexing and increasing those fees annually and there is also a lawsuit again the City as well, but the Board last night unanimously denied the jurisdiction request. Another item is 1767 North Point Street, which was an interesting issue and appeal, just to note that the permit was going from two dwellings units plus housekeeping unit to three dwelling units on the permit. I think there was some - this caused some confusion, neighbors thought this was legalizing a unit or allowing some illegal unit here, the zoning only allow two-dwelling units, but under the Planning Code, housekeeping units are classified as dwelling units, so under the Planning Code there was no change here. So, for the public who have housekeeping units that is under the Planning Code considered a dwelling unit and the Board unanimously denied the appeal there and allowed the permit to continue. The final item was 405 10
th
 Street. This was a suspension request that I had issued for a building permit application, that allowed a recycling center at 405 10
th
 Street. That permit was issued in error, without requiring neighborhood notification. It is in the SALI – Service Art Light-Industrial Zoning District, which requires neighborhood notification when you change use categories. This was approved in error over the counter so we suspended that to allow time for the notice. The permit holder appealed that because they had made sizeable investments in leasing the property and purchasing equipment. The Board did find that permit was issued in error and upheld the suspension request, so they will have to decide how they would like to proceed next. That was all. There will be a hearing next week, one item that may be of interest next week is actually the appeal of a health permit for an MCD
  
on Ocean Avenue and this was related to the case that we had a couple months ago.
  
So, that was appealed, the permit was issued for the other MCD in the neighborhood. That was appealed by the project sponsor for the case that was before you, so I will have the results for you next week, and I am available for any questions.


 


Commissioner Antonini: 


Mr. Sanchez, just a question on 399 Fremont, I didn’t quite understand what their argument is because it sounds like the fee is based upon the date when the project pulls the first construction permit, which is clearly in this calendar year, so, I mean, what are they challenging? I don’t understand what the challenge is. 


 


Scott Sanchez: 


That’s an excellent question. We think the Code is very clear.
  


 


HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:


 


Tina Tam:


Good afternoon President Wu and members of the Commission, Tina Tam for the Planning Department. In Tim Frye’s absence, I am here to present the report for this week’s hearing at the Architectural Review Committee and the Historic Preservation Commission. On Wednesday, July 16
th
, the ARC reviewed and commented on the proposed exterior changes to 50 Fell Street. 50 Fell Street is a Category 1, Significant Building under Article 11 of the Planning Code.
  
Constructed in 1931, the structure at 50 Fell Street is an L-shape, Spanish Colonial Revival building, designed by Architect Willis Polk.
  
At the hearing, ARC agreed with the Planning Department staff’s recommendation and assessment that changes are needed in order for the project to be consistent with the Secretary of the Interior Standards and comparable with the historic building and property.
  
Specifically, the ARC commented on the proposed design and material for the new doors and windows, new ramp and railings, and the new playground in the courtyard. The project does need a Major Permit to Alter and that will be scheduled before the HPC in the near future. Also, on the 16
th
 of July, the HPC heard two items on their calendar. The first one is the review and comment for the Preservation Element, this is a second hearing of the draft element for the HPC, and this hearing focused on Objectives 4-6. A subsequent hearing will be scheduled on August the 20
th
 to discuss Objectives 7 and 9.
  
Please note that the hearing will be followed by a series of other public meetings with various stakeholders and will be reviewed and revised by the Planning Department before they conduct their environmental review.
  
Upon conducting the – and completing the environmental review, the document will be presented before the HPC and the Planning Commission for endorsement. The adoption of the element by the Board of Supervisors is anticipated to take place in 2015. The second item on their calendar was the National Register nomination request for 1772 Vallejo Street, which is also known as the Burr House. The Burr House is located in San Francisco, Pacific Heights Neighborhood, on the north side of Vallejo Street between Franklin and Gough. It’s designed with a blend of an Italianate and Second Empire style influences. The building was commissioned by former San Francisco Mayor, Ephraim Burr, as a wedding gift to his son Edmond Burr, a chemical engineer, and his wife Anna Bernard. The property also includes two other buildings in the back, a one-story wood frame vernacular cottage and a one-story auto garage.
  
The property is also known to the City as City Landmark No. 31. As recommend by Department staff, the HPC adopted a resolution to recommend to the State Historic Preservation Office to list the property on the National Register of historic places, comprising of not only the main building, but also the one-story vernacular cottage and the gardens. Unless you have any questions for me, that concludes my report.
