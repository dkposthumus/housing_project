DIRECTOR RAHAIM:


Good Afternoon Commissioners.
  
We will shortly be presenting our first on a series of hearings on the budget, so I’ll defer that. Two things to report on, last night we had the public meeting on the release of the first phase of the Urban Forest Master Plan. We had a very good turnout. We probably had 150 people in the room. Supervisor Wiener came. It was a very good meeting. The real focus of this Plan has been on the street tree issue and how to retain that, and grow that over time, and in particular the maintenance of that issue, so part of much of the discussion was on the maintenance of street trees which the City has been of late turning over to private property owners and the goal of this plan is to set the stage to allow that maintenance responsibility to go back to the City. Supervisor Wiener has actually has been a strong supporter of doing so. It was a very good turnout. There is money already in next year's budget for us to continue to work into the next phase and we are working with our partners at DPW, the Park’s Alliance and Urban Forest Counsel to kind of move this forward. The second thing, I want to tell you about it,
  
is the Housing Task Force, that was created as a result of the Mayor's Executive Directive, a couple of weeks ago. We had the first meeting of that task force last Friday. That Task Force is being chaired by Tom Hui of DBI and co-chaired by myself. There were about 20 people in the room. We went through a little bit of getting organized meeting, the first meeting. The goal of the Task Force is to, what we concluded was the goal, I should point out that President Fong is on that task force as well.
  
The goal is to kind of
  
develop a series of short-term recommendations that we can implement without legislation that would help housing protection especially for low and moderate income housing recommendations, that secondly would require legislation and thirdly to also develop some longer-term policy recommendations around the production of low- moderate to low income housing. That task force is meeting again tomorrow with some initial thoughts from the staffs of both departments who will go over those. The Mayor has asked that we respond at least to the Directive initially by the end of the month. The task force will continue to meet afterwards to talk about these longer-term policy questions as well. That concludes my report and I'm happy to answer any questions. Thank you.

Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission


          
 


LAND USE COMMITTEE:
  


·
         
The Land Use Committee held a hearing for AT&T, the Department of Public Works, and the Planning Department to discuss the roll-out of the at&t u-verse telecommunications upgrade.
  
“The Land Use Committee held a hearing for AT&T, the Department of Public Works, and the Planning Department to discuss the 
 
roll-out of the at&t u-verse telecommunications upgrade.
  
The hearing focused on the permitting and site installation of the sidewalk cabinets (Surface-Mounted Facilities, or SMFs), the current community outreach and permitting process, and suggestions for improvements to the process.
  
Supervisor Wiener opened by providing background on the Categorical Exemption granted to the boxes’ installation, and an Appeal to the CATEX which was denied.
  
DPW BSM (Lynn Fong; John Kwong) delivered a presentation on the current process and procedures – based on DPW Order 175,556 (August 2005), the MOU between AT&T and the CCCSF (July 2011) – for box permit application, public outreach, and installation. Of the original (in 2008) 726 proposed SMFs, 185 have been approved and 2000 protests have been lodged. Of this set of approved SMFs, 136 have been installed to date.
  
The Supervisors asked DPW BSM about the status of Planning’s involvement in urban design review and placement of the boxes.
  
DPW BSM confirmed that Planning has been folded into the application review process; and that Planning has been actively involved in researching best practices and mitigations for the boxes (greening).
  
DPW BSM confirmed that each application that DPW receives from ATT is also routed to Planning for review and recommendation(s) for the appropriate greening mitigation.
  
ATT (Marc Blakeman, Regional Vice President of External Affairs) then delivered remarks and responded to further questions from the Supervisors.
  
The ATT representative disagreed with the suggestion that ATT should fund maintenance for the greening mitigation options.
  
Public comments comprised next two hours of the hearing, with members of the public registering various frustrations with the public notifications, outreach and engagement process.
  
DPW BSM (Lynn Fong) was invited by Board Members to close the hearing by providing additional clarification to issues raised in the presentation by ATT, and in public comment.
  
Supervisor Weiner, DPW, and Planning are developing an Ordinance for all SMF facilities (including those proposed by ATT), which will address the issues aired in the hearing.” 
Supervisor Weiner, DPW, and Planning are developing a code specifically for the boxes, which will address the issues aired in the hearing.


·
         
Two ordinances for the “Adjacent Parcels” were before the Land Use Committee on Monday. 
The first item was an ordinance amending the General Plan by amending the boundaries of the East South of Market Area Plan to incorporate 40 nearby parcels on Mission Street. This ordinance also amends the Market and Octavia Area Plan to incorporate nine adjacent parcels along Mission and 10th Streets, and amends the Western South of Market Area Plan to remove one parcel on 10th Street. The second piece of legislation presented was an ordinance amending the Zoning Map to revise use districts and height and bulk districts for parcels adjacent to and within the Western South of Market Area Plan, and to extend the Van Ness and Market Downtown Residential Special Use District.
  
This Commission approved these two ordinances unanimously on October 10th with a minor modification.
  
Since then Supervisor Jane Kim sponsored this legislation and amended the language to reflect this Commission’s recommendation.
  
There was no public comment. Supervisor Weiner asked two questions related to any potential changes to the Western SOMA Plan, specifically whether more restrictive zoning would be imposed as a result of these amendments. Mr. Teague responded that there would be no height changes or new restrictions on zoning; in fact, the zoning change to MUO from SLR along Mission Street would in fact be more permissive, allowing for office uses. 
The Land Use Committee moved this legislation forward to the full Board for their approval.


 


·
         
Also at LU was the Fulton Street Grocery SUD.
  
Supe Breed.
  
This request is associated with a development project located at 555 Fulton Street that would demolish the existing building on the site and construct a new mixed-use project with residential uses and a ground-floor grocery store. The project was originally approved by the Planning Commission in 2010. On October 3, 2013, the Commission recommended extension of the SUD for an additional five years. The Commission also recommended several amendments to the SUD. Last week, Planning Staff described the commission’s recommendations including: 1) working with staff on language to enable formula retail uses at the site, provided that the future grocery store tenant would provide food that is affordable to the neighborhood 2) increasing the allowable size for commercial uses to increase the flexibility in potential tenants; and 3) increased signage controls.
 Supervisor Breed noted that she is still considering whether formula retail should be permitted at the site, but that she wanted to enable the other facets of the development. She recommended that the Committee accept the Commission’s recommendation for more strict signage controls
[i]
—and these were approved by the Committee last week.
  
This week the Committee recommended approval to the FB and on Tuesday the Board approved the ordinance as amended on first reading.

BOARD OF APPEALS:


Board of Appeals did meet last night. One item, that I think maybe of interest to the Commission is the project at 1050 Valencia Street. Back on December 12
th
, the Board of Appeals took action on this item. You heard this in December of 2012 it’s at the corner of Hill and Valencia Streets, a five-story mixed use building. The Board of Appeals took action on it on December 11
th
 and added conditions to the permit related to construction activities and that's to address concerns of the adjacent Marsh Theatre, but they also took the 5th floor off of the building, last night they considered written findings related to their decision last week as part of submittals, the appellant submitted arguments that the Board’s decision does not comply with the State law for the Housing Accountability Act. The Board had questions on this last night the applicability of the statute and continued the written findings to the end of February to allow additional briefing from the parties to address this matter. That is all the report from the Board of Appeals. I would like to thank Corey Teague for covering while I was out for November and December, and appreciate the tremendous job and it’s much appreciated. Thank you.


HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:


Good Afternoon, Commissioners, Tim Frye, Department staff, here to share with you a couple items from yesterday, Historic Preservation Commission hearing. The Commission began with Election of Officers, the Commission voted to maintain Commissioners Carl Hasz as President and Commissioner Andrew Wolfram, as Vice-President.
  
At that time Commissioner President Hasz appointed or maintained the appointments to the Architectural Review Committee of Commissioners Hyland, Pearlman and Wolfram, with Commissioner Hasz remaining as ex-officio member. The HPC also considered a request for hearing for an Administrative Certificate of Appropriateness at 280 Union Street, in the Telegraph Hill Landmark District, the Admin. C of A, which was approved by staff, was to construct a non-visible roof deck on a non-contributing building within the District. The hearing requester contends that the building constructed in 1987 was not built according to Code and was actually constructed taller than the allowable height limit. Planning Department staff presented that along with our Code Enforcement staff and DBI, we did examine the site and found no evidence of any error, and proceeded with processing the Admin. C of A. After testimony by the requester and the property owner, the Commission determined that the Planning Department operated within its jurisdiction on the Administrative C of A delegation and denied the request for hearing. The Commission also initiated Article 10 Landmark Designation for 2 Henry Adams Street. It’s currently known as the Design Center, and historically known as the Dunham, Carrigan and Hayden Building. This is the first hearing, out of two hearings where the HPC will weigh the merits of the property as an individual landmark for Article 10 of the Planning Code prior to a vote by the Board of Supervisors. The Commission also gave a positive recommendation to a piece of legislation to authorize and rezone St. Boniface Church, a local landmark at 133-135 Golden Gate Avenue to be rezoned to C-3 and also be able to take advantage of the Transfer Development Rights program. Finally, the War Memorial Complex Certificate of Appropriateness for the Veterans Building, this is a previous Certificate of Appropriateness that the HPC approved. There was a small design modification to some non-visible skyline on the top portion of the roof which required re-review. The Commission supported the modification with an amendment that the veterans be invited to the mockup of the new skylights along with the other mockups that will be presented to Planning Department Preservation staff. That concludes my comments unless you have any questions. Thank you.
