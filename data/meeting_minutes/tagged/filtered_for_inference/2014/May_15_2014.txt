Commissioner Antonini: 


Comments on a couple of things, and one is an unfortunate situation that occurred last week. Some of you may have seen this on the news, which was reported by KTVU, David Stevenson. A small restaurant in the Mission District was vandalized and painted with graffiti saying, “Get out,” and so, Stevenson looked into this and it actually turns out it’s Locals Corner, which is one of Michael Bauer’s top 100, but it’s a very small place, and it's exactly what we’re asking restaurants to be, locally owned, sustainable food, locally grown, modestly priced from the menu that I looked at. So, I really don't know what the whole point was. Apparently, there were some claims that people were turned away, but the restaurant was filled the night they came there, as was the case when I went there and they said they we only have 20 seats, we can’t take everybody that wants to get in there. So, I think this sets a bad example for San Francisco and people are engaging their moneys and their efforts into starting small businesses are terrorized and also this group is not formula retail. They do have three establishments. One of the other ones is a local market, which everybody is crying for. They have a market, that, you know, will actually do pickup and delivery, no parking a couple of blocks away on Harrison Street and their third place on 24
th
 Street, which is an even more casual establishment.
  
So hopefully, I just wanted to note that, because there were some people who were trying to defend the vandals.
  
I don’t quite understand their logic, so anyway.
  
Another issue, I'm reading a book now that I think would be very good, book for all us to read, who is interested in planning issues. It's called Dead End Suburban Sprawl and the Rebirth of American Urbanism and the author is Benjamin, um, I think his last name is Russ, I can't read my writing here, but in any case, I am about halfway through it. It is very interesting. He goes through the whole history of the streetcar suburbs, which really weren’t suburbs, they were areas like the western part of San Francisco or the southern part of San Francisco,
  
where they were made accessible by the building of streetcar lines and then the beginnings of urban sprawl and all the bad things that went with them, auto-dependency. 
  
It is kind of strange, because - - I haven’t been to Europe for about 40 years and it’s probably changed, but I remember going to places like Paris and Rome and not really seeing suburbs in the sense that we have them.
  
The cities would grow out, and the city would go and go, and then you'd reach the countryside and then you would come to a town that was some miles away from the city itself.
  
So hopefully, they’ve been able avoid the problems we have here. And the third thing I want to comment, I went to an event last night sponsored by TMG Partners. I saw President Wu there.
  
Very interesting, it was a forum on the role of tech. 
 
Some very interesting speakers and they talked about disruptive innovation.
  
Basically, the point was that these firms have been very successful because they disrupt the standard operating procedure for so many industries, not because of the internet, but because they have the internet as a tool they can apply and they can do things that have been quite successful. 
 
One thing they pointed out, which I wasn’t aware of, but apparently AirBnB it has – or will soon have, as many rooms or – for -- under their auspices available to people who wish to use them worldwide as does Hilton Intercontinental, which is the largest hotel chain in the world.
  
So it’s an interesting concept, but I think the Internet made that possible for that sort of thing to be done.

Director’s Announcements


                


Director Rahaim:


Good afternoon, Commission.
  
Our new engineer in staff, Susan Gygi, wanted me to let you know that this week is National Infrastructure Week - but as the Department gets more involved in these larger transportation issues, sea level rise issues, we're much more engaged in major infrastructure planning than we’ve ever been before.
  
So, the week is kind of celebrated by the many engineers around the world as kind of looking at emerging solutions and best practices being developed to modernize our aging infrastructure.
  
So I just wanted to take a moment to thank the departments that are all involved with this. Obviously, we work closely with DPW and MTA and others -- PUC
  
and other city agencies who are very closely involved in this. 
 
I think we’re all developing a new found appreciation for the infrastructure of the City and how important it is to keep it up in our aging cities. That concludes my report. 
 
Thank you.

Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission


 


LAND USE COMMITTEE:
  


·
         
Hearing (Sup. Weiner) - Street Widths in Hunters Point Shipyard and Candlestick Point Developments.
  This was hearing requested by Supervisor Wiener to discuss the Fire Department’s decision to require a minimum street width of 26’ in the new Hunters Point and Candlestick developments.  The Development was originally approved with 20’ street widths, but the Fire Department has asked that most streets have a minimum of 26’.  At the hearing the Fire Department explained their policy rationale for requiring these changes, which focused mainly on safety and the ability of their trucks to function properly during an emergency.  Other City departments, including the Planning Department and DPW, focused on their policy rational for signing off on the original 20’ wide street widths, which are consistent with the City’s Better Streets Plan, the Pedestrian Safety Strategy, and “Vision Zero” policy.  The Department was represented by John Rahaim and Neil Hrushowy.  The Supervisors were very engaged in the presentation and there were several public speakers, the majority of whom supported the City’s original decision to have 20-foot wide streets.  In the debate, it was clear that both sides were motivated by public safety concerns and while no resolution came from the hearing, it helped illuminate the various issues and overlapping city priorities. This was only a hearing and no action was taken.  The Committee closed the hearing and tabled the item to the call of the chair.

140062 Mayor Lee and Sup. Cohen.
  
Planning Code changes to P Zoned Districts for the SF Plaza Program.
  
This Ordinance would amend controls in the Planning Code for P Districts in order to facilitate the new SF Plaza Program.
  
This item was heard by the Planning Commission on May 1 of this year and rwas recommended unanimously for approval.
  
There was very little discussion on this item, as the committee was close to losing a quorum because of the previous hearing, but the Committee did express support for the overall program and gratitude to City Staff for working with the community to modify the Ordinance based on their concerns.
  
The Committee voted to move this Ordinance to the Board with a positive recommendation.
