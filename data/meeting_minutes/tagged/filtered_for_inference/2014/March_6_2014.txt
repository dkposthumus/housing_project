Commissioner Antonini:


Yeah, just commenting on, there was an article in the Chronicle on Sunday, which was interesting, written by Heather Knight. It talked about the discrepancy between the highest income and lowest income groups in San Francisco. Apparently, it was set to be the highest in the United States, but I think when we look at these sorts of things, we have to realize San Francisco is a special situation. First of all, we're a City and County, so that being said, often times other cities which are being compared are part of the county and generally affordability requirements or suggestions are by a county level, and so in many instances, you will have public housing or affordable housing spread out throughout many cities in a county. It might lessen the amount of that type
  
of housing, in a particular city, that’s the focus of the study, also in San Francisco you dealing with a city surrounded by water and the victim of decision in 1856, which I think was unfortunate, when the county line was put right south of San Francisco and the rest of -- was San Francisco was made into San Mateo County so, what you have is in cities very close to San Francisco, like Pacifica, Daly City, which incidentally is the highest populated city in San Mateo County, with a 105,000 residents, and Colma and South City, and Pacifica, are a lot -- of housing that's a little bit more affordable particularly to the middle class so I think if you looked at San Francisco, in the context, what most
  
of the other cities that are being compared, it would be that it include areas that are just to the periphery of these cities, then you probably get a little different take on this difference between incomes and the lack of middle income residents. 
 
Although we do have a big
  
problem, because we don't have enough housing that is acceptable for people in the middle income range, particularly those with families, particularly houses that are single family homes that are attractive to people, who have children, and we have to strive to build as many as we can, I doubt we are going to be able to change the county line and you know the Bay is where it is,
  
and some of these other factors are beyond our control, but we certainly can ameliorate some of the problems by preserving as many single-family homes as we can
  
and by creating, as many new ones as we can, with the land that is available, so, I think when we read this study we have to kind of realize, you know, we're comparing apples and oranges even New York City, which has -- is a city with 5 counties or 5 boroughs, although there's more of a density than San Francisco,
  
there's more room to spread housing out in the different boroughs, it’s not like San Francisco. San Francisco is more like Manhattan, where it is much denser and more concentrated. So, it's always good to read these and kind of look at all the factors involved.


Commissioner Wu:


I wanted to comment on what's called the Housing Production Summary. I think the name is going to change, it’s been updated, it’s the comparison of what’s been entitled and built compared to the arena goals. And so, we now have the numbers through the end of 2013, starting in 2007 and in the over-moderate category there has been 190 percent of what was projected, so you know we are clearly way over in the over-moderate category, and then under on the goals for all the other ones.
  
I just want to mention this to say that, I believe a number of discussions will be happening about the Housing Element upcoming, and I think that we should use this to guide our policy development going into that process.

Director’s Announcements


                


Director Rahaim:


Good afternoon, Commissioners. Just wanted to let you know that we're kicking off a new Public

Realm Design Plan for Ocean Avenue and we are having two public events in the next few days. One is this Saturday, which is a site walk on Ocean Avenue, from 10:00 A.M. to noon, meeting at the Fog Lifter Café, which is at 1901 Ocean Avenue and the second is next Wednesday the 12
th 
from 6:00 to 8:00 pm.,
  
at Lick-Wilmerding High School, which is 755 Ocean. We are kicking this off with our partners and the other agencies in the local community to look at pedestrian improvements on Ocean Avenue. Secondly, there was a -- you might have heard that there was a press conference this morning, the Mayor and several Department heads where there to announce the new Pedestrian Safety Strategy for the City reflecting the need to really increase pedestrian safety in much of the City because pedestrian accidents have been on the increase in the last couple years, and the Mayor and Department heads and Board of Supervisors are all together putting forth this strategy that would not only look at enforcement issues, but design issues and short term solutions that will help improve pedestrian conditions all over the City, interesting statistic is that, there are six street segments that are responsible for 60 percent of the serious accidents, so this strategy will obviously looking at those segments of streets very intensely from a design standpoint, and a management standpoint, enforcement standpoint, to really address those issues. So we'll keep you informed on the statistics as we move forward, as this is implemented.
  
That concludes my report.

NONE 


FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: 


·
         
140136 Market & Octavia CAC Appts.: Krute Singa, Kenneth Wingard, Dennis Richards, and Jason Henderson 
Approved.


·
         
Landmark Designation for 660 California Street.
  
This property is commonly known as Old St. Mary’s Rectory.
  
The designation will change from an “unrated” building to a “contributory” building.
  
The HPC recommended making this change on Nov. 20, 2013.
  
This week the Full Board approved the ordinance on FINAL reading.


·
         
Zoning Map change for St. Boniface.
  
This property is located in the Tenderloin. Supervisor Kim sponsored the rezoning. The rezoing from RC-4 to C-3-G will enable the existing landmark building to be eligible for transferable development rights. In January of this year both the Historic Preservation Commission and the Planning Commission recommended approval.
  
This week the Full Board recommended approval on first reading.


·
         
Planning Code Text Change.
  
This change would allow certain nonconforming structures to be rebuilt.
  
The Planning Commission considered this ordinance most recently on Feb 6, 2014.
  
At that hearing the Commission voted 3-3 to recommend approval.
  
As there were not four affirmative votes, this constituted a failed motion.
  
After the hearing, the 90-day limit for a Commission recommendation expired—this resulted in a defacto recommendation of disapproval.
  
At the Board’s committee hearing last week Supervisor Kim amended the ordinance to specific that the text change only apply to the block and lot with the proposed Apple Store.
 This week the Full Board approved the ordinance with that amendment and supporting findings, on first reading.


 


INTRODUCTIONS:


·
         
Supervisor Mar 
introduced a hearing request on the Budget & Legislative Analyst’s report on SF’s strategies to prevent & fill commercial vacancies.


·
         
Mayor Lee and Supervisors Cohen, Campos & Chiu, 
introduced a revised version of the ordinance to amend Production, Distribution, and Repair (or PDR) Zoning Controls.
  
Commission, this revised ordinance is currently scheduled for your consideration next week.


 


BOARD OF APPEALS:


No Report


 


HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:


Good Afternoon Commissioners, Tim Frye, Department staff, here to share with you the results from yesterday, Historical Preservation Commission hearing, just one item to share with you, the HPC gave its final recommendation to the Board of Supervisors for the landmark designation of the Dunham Carrigan & Hayden Building at 2 Henry Adams. The building is significant for its association with the company and with the products that the company produced during the gold rush as well as the post 1906 reconstruction.
  
The building is also a fine example of the early 20
th
 Century American Commercial Style, constructed of brick and heavy timber framing. The Commission unanimously approved their final recommendation, that the building appears eligible for local landmark designation. They did amend our requested amendment of the ordinance to require a publicly accessible historic interpretation to be located on the site of the property, which will be included before the item is heard before the Board of Supervisors at a future date. There were a few tenants that spoke, at the hearing and raised some concerns about primarily not the designation, but the change of use of the property. The Planning Code allows for landmark properties with the Showplace Square Area Plan, to convert from PDR zoning to office as-of-right. The concerns again were not over the landmark designation, or over the proposed landmark designation, but the potential change of use. The property owner has applied for a -- to convert the property to an office use. While that conversion is as-of-right because of the size of the property this Commission will hear an office allocation at a future hearing and those items will likely -- those issues will likely be raised before you at that time. That concludes my presentation. If you have any questions, I’d be happy to answer them, thank you.
