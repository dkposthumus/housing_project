Commissioner Moore:


I would like to make a comment on the item we just approved on consent and that is the incredible transformation of value. The addition of this small one of a kind retail store has made to the building, which was very controversial when we approved it here. That particular store has almost transformed the building. 
 
It is amazing, because all of a sudden the attention goes to the ground floor, which is very active. It's a very nice store, I'm vegetarian, I don't shop there, that's another story, but it's quite beautiful and I'm extremely happy to see that as an addition to that particular neighborhood corridor.


 


Commissioner Antonini:


Unfortunately, some disappointing developments in the last few days, which many of you are familiar with. America's Cup, the Lucas Museum and today in the Chronicle mentioned that we may have a problem with funding for the park on the top of the Transbay Terminal. 
 
These are all very sad events and particularly with reference to the situation in the Presidio, although the Presidio Trust is entirely separate from the City and County of San Francisco, a lot of the attitudes may have rubbed off on them because obviously the kind of process that Lucas had to go through led to the fact that he's moving to Chicago now, and I don't quite really understand all of it.
  
Seems like we were really good, we used to make something out of nothing.
  
Now we make nothing out of something. 
 
This return to nature and all these concerns are sometimes overdone, but -- and then in regards to the park at Transbay, if the paper report is correct we're short in funding there and I know that there's quite a bit of money coming out of Mello-Roos already, they have a lot of needs that have to be met, but the numbers involved here as was the case with the America's Cup, in terms of a city that's got a budget of 7 or 8 billion dollars, it's not a lot. 
 
I mean, I think we've got to find a way out of our funding to get that park built at the same time the terminal is finished. 
 
Whatever can be worked out with the other parties there between the Transbay Authority and the individual builders and sponsors in the area who have obligations, that is also encouraged, but I think regardless of what happens, a city that spends 150 million a year on homeless situations without any noticeable improvement and spends 500 million with non-profits with -- I am not quite sure with what most of them are improving as far as the quality of life, we certainly can find 5 or 10 million to get some of these jobs done. 
 
It's just unfortunate that we often have an attitude that was maybe typified unfortunately by the Italian soccer team last, a few days ago. When you play to tie or play not to lose, you end up losing, and you know, we know that from prevent defenses in the NFL, prevent defenses end up causing -- it prevents you from winning and I think we’ve gotta have a little more positive attitude in San Francisco and go out after things and willing to spend the money to make things happen, so let's hope that we find people, like hopefully the Warriors, who have enough interest in being here that would put up with the process and put up with the cost to get to San Francisco, but we can't expect everybody to have that much perseverance.

Director’s Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


Good afternoon, Commissioners, if I may, on the issue of the park, I was a bit surprised to see that in the paper as well, we are looking into the specifics of that that was clearly not the intent. 
 
The intent was the park open with the terminal, clearly the surrounding property owners were also -- had that expectation, so we are looking into the details on that. 
 
Secondly, Commissioners, I wanted to, when, I will put Kate on the spot right now, I wanted to announce that I will be selecting Kate Conner as our new Housing Implementation Specialist, as you know this was a position that was placed in the budget at your request to talk for a person who does all things housing all the time.
  
Kate has shown a lot of experience dealing with housing issues.
  
She'll be working on a number of housing issues - - policy issues and also project issues to move projects through the process across departments working in a number of different housing related projects, so we welcome Kate to her new position. 
 
And that concludes my report, thank you.

BOARD OF APPEALS:


Good afternoon, President Wu and Commissioners, Corey Teague, Planning Department staff.
  
The Board of Appeals did hold a hearing last night and there were two items on their agenda that may be of interest to this Commission.
  
Both of those cases were extremely similar.
  
They were both situations where a single family home had an illegal unit on the ground floor. 
 
There were building permits applied for and approved by the Planning Department and the Building Department and those permits were issued to do the necessary work to remove those illegal units.
  
Both of the appellants claimed that the Mayor's Executive Directive regarding affordable housing and the removal of units, both legal and illegal, should apply in their situation, however, that directive only requires the DR process in that scenario, if the existing building contains three or more dwelling units and that was not the scenario for either of these cases, and
  
the Board of Appeals upheld both building permits. 
 
Those are the only cases at the Board of Appeals last night that were relevant to the Planning Commission.
