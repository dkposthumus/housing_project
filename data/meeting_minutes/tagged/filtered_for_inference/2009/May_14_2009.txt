 Commission Comments/Questions




.
 
 Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to 
 


.
 
 At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.




 


Commissioner Antonini:


On the issue of heights in the downtown area, in addition to discussions as these things move forward, it would be good to have some kind of presentation in keeping with what many members of the public called for, and that is a history of the heights issue during the 60s and 70s in the downtown commercial areas.
 
 If memory serves me right, we went to lower and lower heights, and one unintended consequence of that is we have a lot of buildings that are approximately the same height and perhaps not as much large ground level open space as we might have had if the buildings had been taller.
 
 I don't know if that is necessarily the case, but it is certainly worth noting as we move forward with future discussions of any future buildings or changes in that area.


 


Commissioner Borden:


Two items:
 
 A month or so ago, Judge Kopp came here regarding 800 Brotherhood Way and we had a conversation about Letters of Determination and how those were done.
 
 We talked about calendaring that sometime.


Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:


That is on the calendar next week


Commissioner Borden:


The other issue is we talked about looking at car share and parking requirements in projects and having a hearing on that topic and maybe coming up with some legislation.


Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:


Staff has a working group that is proceeding with that.
 
 I don't know what the timeline is, but as soon as the Commission requested it, we put a group together and we are working on that issue.


Commissioner Moore:


Regarding Mission Bay project update:
 
 I want to know which projects in the economic downturn have been approved and are now stopped.
 
 I not only want to know about the biotech projects, but also the residential.


Zoning Administrator Badiner requested clarification:


Are you asking for something from the Redevelopment Agency that identifies which projects they understand to be on hold?


Commissioner Moore:


That's correct


Commissioner Sugaya:


I have a copy of a mitigated Neg. Dec. for 1080 Sutter Street.
 
 Does that require any planning approvals?


Zoning Administrator Badiner:


I'll take a look at that.


Commissioner Miguel:


I was part of panel on housing and low income housing in San Francisco.
 
 There were five of us being questioned by the current group of CORO Fellows.
 
 Also, I've been able to join Department staff in meetings with Supervisors Maxwell and Chiu to brief them and give them an update on DR Reform.
 
 I have met with people regarding the 430 Main project that is before us.
 
 I was able to attend the meeting of the Duboce Triangle Neighborhood Association as well as have a presentation on the Ocean Avenue Kragen site development that is coming up shortly.
 
 I have requested of the secretary that we close the meeting today in the memory of Brian O'Neil.
 
 He was the Superintendant of the GGNRA with 25 years in the National Park service.
 
 He was known all over the country as an expert on how a federal government agency should interface with other government bodies.
 
 He understood land use.
 
 He understood built areas. He understood natural areas.
 
 He passed away yesterday at 67 years of age.
 
 This is a great loss to the park service and to the Bay Area in general.


Commissioner Moore:


I participated in a seminar on inclusionary housing led by experts from across the country.
 
 It was interesting that there are more than 200 communities in the United States that are actively pursuing inclusionary housing.
 
 And some, believe it or not, at significantly higher rates for BMR than we are doing.
 
 Most noted was Davis California at between 30 to 35 percent.


Commissioner Antonini:


I neglected to mention that I had met with the project sponsors of the Ocean Avenue Kragen site and also with parties involved in the issues surrounding 430 Main Street.

 DIRECTOR'S REPORT


 


8.
 
 Director's Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


Per the request of several commissioners, staff and I met with the Acting Director of the Small Business Commission.
 
 We had a good conversation about how to share information and talked also about the idea of a joint hearing in the future.
 
 We're going to work some more on that and decide what those topics of that joint hearing be.
 


Zoning Administrator Badiner:


Commissioner Moore already mentioned the Mission Bay report we put together that was in your packets this week.
 
 We will follow up on her additional questions.
 
 There is also a memo that Commissioner Antonini requested about historic preservation in Savannah that we responded to.
 
 I want to let you know that we are proceeding with an effort on universal planning notices.
 
 We have numerous different kinds of notices – over 40 different kinds of notice that have accumulated over the years that we've had the Planning Code.
 
 This is an effort to reduce those to a manageable number to avoid issues and questions and get some standardization.
 
 There is a meeting this Tuesday at six o'clock in the Planning Department offices to kick this off and hear from the public their ideas and which way we should go on this.
 
 We would ask if you are planning to attend this meeting that you contact Maria Oropeza at 558-6307.
 
 Mr. Sider is here to introduce to you and the public a report that we have just released called 
NC@20
 (Neighborhood Commercial @ 20).
 
 We have had the Neighborhood Commercial Controls in place for twenty years and we think it's time to do an overview of it and that's what this report is.


Dan Sider, Department Staff:


We are very please today to be here to announce the availability of our draft NC@20 report as the Zoning Administrator just mentioned.
 
 The report is designed to meet Planning Code reporting requirements for you and the Board of Supervisors, but more importantly, we hope this will frame future discussions on the shape of the NC districts and the controls that affect them.
 
 We look at the history of the NC districts, development and application patterns and some recommendations to deal with the emerging issues in the NC districts.
 
 First, while the controls are effective and have been resilient, after 20 years and dozens of piecemeal changes and amendments, it's time to step back and do a wholesale comprehensive land use survey and planning process.
 
 Secondly, we do need to adopt specific provisions to support our small businesses – to encourage the small businesses that we do want.
 
 And lastly, the controls that apply to eating and drinking uses – it's a bit overdue for an overhaul on those controls.
 
 How people use and how restaurants and bars operate has changes over time and its time our Code reflects that.
 
 This report is a draft and we don't want to rush your review and the public's review of this document.
 
 Later this summer we will schedule a formal commission hearing and have a more robust discussion on this.
 
 Commissioners you have a copy in your packets.
 
 The report is also available on line on the Department's website at 
www.sfplanning.org
, under the New Releases section.
 
 Hard copies are also available at the Department for a nominal fee.


Commissioner Olague:


Thanked the Department for the report.
 
 It's been long overdue.
 
 I think it might be useful to have a joint hearing on this with the Small Business Commission and with the Entertainment Commission.


Commissioner Miguel:


I have not had a chance to read this, but NC district over the years have expanded and contracted.
 
 Have you dealt with that issue as far as zoning is concerned?
 
 In other words, what was an NC district twenty years ago may be three blocks longer now.
 
 I think that is a consideration that should be looked at.


 


9.
 
 Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.


 


 


Board of Supervisors


 


Land Use:




Building Code -
 
This ordinance would require amended certificates of final completion and occupancy for changes of occupancy of existing buildings.
 
 The Commission heard this item on 3/26 and recommended approval with three amendments:
 
 (1) expand the breadth of the ordnance to the entire city; (2) add language to ensure that fees normally captured at final occupancy would also be captured at amended occupancy; and (3) asked that the Board consider the impact of the ordinance on affordability.
 
 
This week the Committee heard an amended ordinance that would pertain to the entire city and would capture any fees normally collected at final occupancy.
 
 The committee did not act but continued the item for further consideration
.




Budget:




Mills Act application for 178 Townsend.
 
 
This property requested a tax reduction of nearly $171,000 per year.
 
 This tax reduction would be associated with a proposal to transform the one-story brick warehouse into an 85-unit building with ground floor retail.
 
 The
 
Planning Commission approved the associated CU on 9/4/08.
 
 On 2/4/09, the Historic Preservation Commission reviewed the historical property contract, the proposed rehabilitation and the maintenance plan.
 
 At that time the HPC recommended approval of the contract.
 
 This week the Rules Committee asked a number of questions about the value of the contract and questioned if the contract should be for the entire project or just the remaining historical faÃ§ade.
 
 
Ultimately the Committee stated that they were not comfortable approving the contract and continued the item to the call of the chair.
 
 The Committee further requested that the project sponsor modify the contract so that just the facades would receive the Mills Act rebate.




Full Board:




Rezoning of 2400 Irving Street –
 
The Planning Commission approved rezoning this lot from a split zoning of NC-2/RH-2 to a uniform NC-2 on 2/5/09.
 
 
This week the Board finally passed the ordinance on 2
nd
 reading.




 


Board of Appeals




252 9
th
 Street
, a demolition permit on a commercial/industrial building.
 
 It was appealed by Jackie Bryson on historic issues.
 
 The permit was originally approved by the Planning Department in 2002.
 
 We believe there were significant changes since then.
 
 We were in support of the appeal and further environmental work needs to be done.
 
 The Board voted 3 to 1 with Commissioner Peterson absent to continue the item to the call of the chair to allow environmental issues to be resolved.


652 Kearny Street
 
– a 7/11, which the Planning Commission took DR to disapprove and subsequent to that, imposed CU requirements.
 
 The Board adopted those and they became law.
 
 As the Commission is aware, where there is conditional use, the Board of Appeals has no jurisdiction.
 
 However, this permit was taken up prior to the conditional use and the appellant argued that the CU was in effect a spot zoning that specifically targeted this site and that Russian Hill Improvement Association, which is the governing law vs the Board of Appeals in the 1967 case, requires the Board to apply the law that was in effect at the time does not hold in this case because it was a spec spot zoning.
 
 That is not the case we believe.
 
 We also do not believe the appellant was purposely delayed as he claimed.
 
 The Board of Appeals agreed with us and voted 4 to 0 with Commissioner Peterson absent to dismiss the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and uphold the Commission's decision to deny the 7/11 in the Chinatown area.


DR Reform
 
was presented to the Board last night.
 
 There were concerns expressed especially by Commissioner Goh, but overall there seemed to be support.

SPEAKERS:


Jamie Whitaker
, 
Vice President, Rincon Hill Neighborhood Association
. 
 
I'm here to speak on the SOMA Stabilization Fee.
 
 The Rincon Hill area is 14 blocks.
 
 The SOMA Stabilization Fee applies to those 14 blocks only.
 
 A few weeks ago Commissioner Antonini suggested there be a nexus study on the SOMA Stabilization Fee.
 
 We thank the commissioner and encourage the Department and Commission to pursue a nexus study on the SOMA Stabilization Fee.


Jeffrey Heller – Heller Mannus
.
 
 I'm here to comment on issues of height and spot zoning because I personally was involved in the process all the way back from 1970, through SPUR, through the AIA, with Allan Jacobs, with Dick Hedman – the author of the plan - the urban designer.
 
 I thought it was worth putting on the record that the height zoning in the downtown area has been consistently carried through for all that time, more than 40 years.
 
 It started out in a C-3 at an unlimited height and after the Transamerica Building, in the north part, its plan was never changed was transitional from about 241 to 400 feet.
 
 In the mid 70's was zoned to 300 feet, then when the Downtown Plan was done, was dropped to 200 feet when the Downtown Planned dropped all the heights throughout the downtown to make a preservation plan so that no building would pierce the skyline as it was at that time.
 
 Today, the city, the Planning Department, the Planning Commission, and even the Board of Supervisors realizes that we have to be a more bay region centric, sustainable, transit base city and the heights have gone up.
 
 When people talk about what was the intent, that was the real intent.
 
 The Intent today is to be more restorative of a city with proper heights.


Ernestine Weiss
:
 
 I'm here to talk about 8 Washington Street.
 
 This is a perfect example of what not to do in the city of San Francisco.
 
 This is the densest part of the city.
 
 The downtown is full of high rises. As the creator of Ferry Park as open space, I can't believe that they would put up another high rise building at the opposite corner of the park.
 
 All the neighbors are against it.
 
 There are no positives, only negatives.
 
 The height is wrong; the underground garage is wrong; everybody objects to the whole thing.
 
 This is an opportunity to make this part of the waterfront the most outstanding place in the city of San Francisco.

PUBLIC COMMENT ON AGENDA ITEMS WHERE THE PUBLIC HEARING HAS BEEN CLOSED


 


 
 At this time, members of the public who wish to address the Commission on agenda items that have already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the public hearing has been closed must do so at this time.
 
 Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.


 


 


SPEAKERS:


Courtney Clarkson:
 
 I'm here to make a few comments on item 17, the EIR for 2901 California Street.
 
 I would suggest that the EIR not be certified.
 
 It comes down to the fact that all these private schools in residential neighborhoods keep expanding and tearing down sound residential housing.
 
 I think that the three-unit building on Broderick Street is sound, historic, residential housing.
 
 Given that the school is located across the street from a neighborhood commercial district on both sides of California where there are quite a few building that have been for sale over the last few years, it would be far more suitable to expand the school & 
 
 It is just bad policy to keep tearing down our residential housing stock.
 
 I hope this is something you will take in consideration when the item comes up.


Judith Hoyem, San Francisco Preservation Consortium:
 
 
I wish to speak against the certification of the EIR (for 2901 California Street) to demolish the building next door to the Drew School.
 
 The three-unit building next door to the school is sound housing.
 
 There is no argument about that.
 
 It is three units.
 
 It is rent-controlled housing, and it is also an historic resource.
 
 It is puzzling to me that an EIR could ignore those factors and allow a building like this to be demolished.
 
 We always here that the city needs housing and here is an example of three units of housing that will be removed.
