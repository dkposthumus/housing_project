San Joaquin Pipeline System Project
 
- 
portions of Tuolumne, Stanislaus and San Joaquin Counties
 - 
Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report
 - The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) proposes the San Joaquin Pipeline (SJPL) System Project, which is comprised of repair or replacement of an approximately 6.5-mile segment of SJPL No. 3 in the eastern portion of the SJPL System beginning at the Oakdale Portal in Tuolumne County and extending west to unincorporated Stanislaus County, and construction of a new approximately 11-mile pipeline, SJPL No. 4, beginning near a new crossover facility (Pelican Crossover) west of the San Joaquin River in Stanislaus County and extending to the Tesla Portal facility in San Joaquin County. The project also proposes construction of two new crossover facilities along the SJPL System: Emery Crossover located about 9.5 miles west of the Oakdale Portal in unincorporated Stanislaus County, and Pelican Crossover, located west of the San Joaquin River at the eastern terminus of the new pipeline in unincorporated Stanislaus County. Ancillary project components include site improvements at the Oakdale Portal, construction of two new throttling stations along SJPL No. 3 in the eastern portion of the SJPL System; upgrade/replacement of existing valves at the discharge facilities at Cashman Creek; and replacement of the existing valves and discharge piping and addition of a new discharge valve at the California Aqueduct.


Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the Environmental Impact Report


Please note: The public hearing on the Draft EIR is closed. The public comment period for the Draft EIR ended on January 26, 2009. The Planning Commission does not conduct public review of Final EIRs. Public comments on the certification may be presented to the Planning Commission during the Public Comment portion of the Commission calendar

Commissioner Antonini:
 


In 1946 a couple of Italian brothers who were in the lumber business started a football team, named them the San Francisco 49'ers and they were admitted to the All American Conference.
 
 In 1950 they were granted a franchise in the National Football League, and ever since then with the exception of one game after the earthquake to my knowledge they have played every home game in the City and County of San Francisco.
 
 It's with a lot of sadness that there is talk about a possible relocation of the 49'ers to south bay 40 miles away.
 
 It's not just sentimental, there are definitely economic concerns.
 
 Projections of about a billion dollars in construction costs, tax revenues, and other items that are beneficial to the City and County of San Francisco, not to mention prestige is at stake.
 
 We also have $100 thousand [million (?)] dollars that has been approved at no cost to the tax payers towards a possible stadium here.
 
 But the 49'ers raise a legitimate concern that goes beyond a possible stadium and that is the access issue.
 
 That is something we have to look at very closely because we're doing housing in that area and a lot of different things in that south eastern quadrant of San Francisco.
 
 I don't know that there is a definite plan as to how the highways are going to lead into that area.
 
 Is there going to be lightrail?
 
 Is there going to be a bridge that goes across or around Yosemite Slough?
 
 Is this particular parkway going to connect up?
 
 How is this all going to fit together?
 
 I think that has to be looked at distinct from the larger transportation aspects of San Francisco.
 
 I think we have excellent public transportation as much as we have 10 BART stations – eight of them in San Francisco and two in the area just south of San Francisco, which is unlike the situation in the south bay where there are no BART stations.
 
 And even if BART is extended to San Jose, it probably is not going to reach any stadium site.
 
 Also, 75% of the population of the area from which the 49'ers draw their fans is to the north of the Santa Clara site and only 25% to the South. 
 
Many of those from the Central Valley would have to circle around to get to any possible south bay site.
 
 With that in mind, I would like to see some sort of hearing.
 
 We have had a couple on transportation issues in the southeast section of San Francisco, but I think we have to dovetail it all together.
 
 I think there are questions about what is going to happen with possible lightrail extension from the Balboa BART station and how we are going to access this area.
 
 Because whether there is a stadium there or not, there is development and development under construction.
 
 I think it is important that we hear from all the stake holders, not just the 49'ers, but commercial stakeholders, housing advocates, retail, and people that have an interest in that area and see what kind of access they think we need for that area to make it more attractive for development and make it a nicer place to live, work, and possibly take part in commercial or retail activities.


Commissioner Borden:
 


I saw in Business Times last week or the week before that the Stanyan Street Whole Foods project was not going forward and the Brenan's were quoted in the article and I want to know if the Department knows anything about that?


 


 


Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:


We only know what we read in the paper.
 
 I will note that the project sponsor was fully aware of all fees that were due when he came in.
 
 It seems to me that if we had proceeded under his guideline he might now be breaking ground on condominiums that might be difficult to sell.
 
 I think it is highly unlikely that Whole Foods would have been able to access the site and be in there at this time.


Commissioner Borden:


Would you just elaborate on what you just said?
 
 It alluded to planning fees as the reason he couldn't go forward.


Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:


It was inclusionary housing fees.
 
 There are school fees and other fees.
 
 That is what I suspect.
 
 I haven't talked to the Brenan's on the issue, but it did seem to me that – this is my personal opinion, not the city's or department's position, it was an opportunity to flex the reality of the economic situation that everyone is facing.


Commissioner Borden:


He did not say that he wanted to give back his entitlements I suppose?


Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:


I have not heard that.


Commissioner Miguel:


I tend to agree with the Zoning Administrator's assessment of that particular project.
 
 And I also definitely agree with Commissioner Antonini's call for a more detailed concept of transportation in the southeast sector.
 
 There has been a lot of comment but nothing in anything that resembles practical concerns there.
 
 In addition, on Monday I was at the EIR scoping for the Park Merced project and on Tuesday, the EIR scoping for CPMC.
 
 Both were reasonably well attended.
 
 CPMC more so, but then it deals with more areas of the city than Park Merced.
 
 There was very different testimony at the two meetings.
 
 Most of the information that came from the Park Merced meeting seemed to me to be obvious matters that the department would be fully aware of.
 
 Whereas at CPMC I thought there were some very cogent remarks that came from various members of the public and I think it was very successful in terms of a scoping session.


Commissioner Antonini:


I neglected to mention that I did meet with a number of neighbors from the Cathedral Hill area and they voiced concern about develop about CPMC on Van Ness.

 Director's Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


Next Thursday the Department's budget hearing is in front of the Land Use Committee of the Board.
 
 It is likely to happen late Thursday morning.
 
 We have been talking to Supervisors in the last couple of weeks.
 
 Given the situation, I don't know where that will head or how long that will take so I may have to be late for this meeting.
 
 The Housing Element is coming to the Commission next week for our initial release of the draft of the Element.
 
 You will receive that today in your packet.
 
 I want to emphasize that this isn't necessarily a hearing about the substance of the Element as much as just a release of the draft for several months of public comment.
 
 There will be a number of public meetings coming up to allow for public comment.
 
 We will invite public comment.
 
 The purpose of next week's hearing is to release our first draft of the Element.
 
 Finally, today or tomorrow you should be receiving the final EIR on the Bicycle Plan.
 
 That is scheduled for June 25
th
, two weeks from today.
 
 That is a substantial document and I just want to give you a heads up and hopefully we can finally move forward with that plan.


 




Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.




 


BOARD OF SUPERVISORS


 


LAND USE:




Massage Ordinance–
 
This Ord. would amend Planning to restrict permitted accessory massage uses and to make most massage establishments, with a few exceptions, subject to a conditional use permit. The Ord. would also add criteria for the Commission to consider when reviewing the CU.
 
 The PC heard this item on May 21
st
.
 
 At that time you recommended modifications to the Ord including: 1) adding an exemption from the CU process for state certified massage establishments and 2) asking that planning staff continue to work with the Supervisor to ensure reasonable access is provided to these establishments.
 
 The version of the Ordinance heard by the Committee was modified to accommodate these recommendations.
 
 The Supervisor added another clause for the Commission's consideration during CU that:  Whether the use is reasonably oriented to facilitate public access.
 
 Barriers that make entrance to the use more difficult than to an average service-provider in the area are to be strongly discouraged.
 
 These include (but are not limited to) foyers equipped with double doors that can be opened only from the inside and security cameras .
 
 With those amendments, t
his week the Committee recommended approval to the Full Board.
 
 Supervisor Mar requested that the Board consider adding funding to assist victims of sex-trafficking in the City's budget.




 


FULL BOARD:
 




Union St. NCD–
 
This Ord. would amend Planning Code to provide for up to (12) new Small Self-Service Restaurants and/or Self-Service Specialty Food uses subject to conditional use authorization.
 
 The PC recommended approval of this Ord. on April 23
rd
 of this year.
 
 You'll recall this Ord. followed up on a similar Ordinance to permit five (5) new full-service restaurants that was approved by the Board on January 16, 2009.
 
 
This week the Full Board passed the Ordinance on first reading.




 




Building Code–
 
This Ord. would require
 
Amended Certificates of Final Completion & Occupancy for Changes of Occupancy of Existing Buildings. The Commission heard this item on March 26 and recommended approval with 3 amendments.
 
 The Commission recommended 1) expanding the breadth of the Ord. to the entire city;
 
 2) adding language to ensure that fees normally captured at final occupancy would also be captured at amended occupancy; and 3) asked that the Board consider the impact of the ordinance on affordability.
 
 
This week the Board heard an amended Ordinance that would pertain to the entire City and would capture any fees normally collected at final occupancy, as recommended by this Commission.
 
 The Board adopted this item unanimously on first reading.




 


NEW INTRODUCTIONS:




Supervisor Maxwell
 
introduced a resolution to extend the interim zoning controls for BV/HP RA Area C for another 6 months.
 
 These controls generally require CU for all new construction, changes of use and for building envelope expansion.
