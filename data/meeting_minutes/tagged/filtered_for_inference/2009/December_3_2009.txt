San Francisco
, in the existing Harney Green and 
Harney
 
Plaza
 area. The proposed project includes removal of Harney Green and Plaza; site excavation; and construction of a three-story with a partial fourth floor, 53-foot high building with a partial basement, which would connect on all floors to the south end of the existing Harney Science Building, and a below-grade, two-level structure, which is also a component of the proposed project.  The roof of this building would serve as a new plaza and pedestrian area.   Together, the new structures would have approximately 60,000 square feet of classrooms, laboratories, instrumentation rooms, and building mechanical/support spaces. The project site is within an RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District and an 80-D Height and Bulk District.  The proposed project would require Conditional Use Authorization for a post-secondary institutional use in an RH-2 District, and for exceeding a building height of 40 feet in an R District.

Commissioner Moore:


I want to bring to the attention of the Commission in Supervisor Dufty’s November Newsletter there was a note that on December 8 there will be a public hearing with the Transportation Authority giving an update on the Strategic Analysis report which includes a discussion of the use and effectiveness of shuttle services in the city.  I submitted a comment to Scott Sanchez reminding him of the concern this Commission has had regarding observations on the use of the shuttle service by the Academy.  Mr. Sanchez picked it up and submitted it to the appropriate people and anybody from the commission who was interested in attending may do so next Tuesday, the 8
th 
at 10:30 a.m. in room 263.  I appreciate Supervisor Dufty’s Newsletter indirectly bringing that to our attention.


Commissioner Antonini:


Last Sunday I had occasion before the 49er game – I actually drove, I usually take public transportation – and I made a bunch of discoveries.  One was that there is a lot of open space, particularly along Cargo and Amador in the area that goes in by 
India
 
Basin
.  I wasn’t aware of this, but there are actually tracks that go all the way down Cargo, probably for industrial purposes, and tie right into the 
3
rd
 Street
 lightrail line.  Also, there is another line that is a Caltrain spur that comes off on 
Carol Street
 and skirts around Yosemite Slew and goes into Hunters Point and there is a 
Golden Gate
 
Railroad
 
Museum
 in there.  I followed those tracks.  I think we have some opportunities and this is something that will be discussed at greater length when we have our hearing on the DEIR on that development.  There are some great transportation opportunities that need to be explored on that northern section.  It is Port land and city owned.


 


 


Commissioner Sugaya:


[He mentioned an article in 
Dialog
, which is about the Director’s views on community and what that means.]  


Second, there was an article (I’ve forgotten where) about 
Hallidie
 
Plaza
 [the Cable Car turnaround] and the city’s plan to improve what has always been a rather dismal place.  I was wondering at some point if we could have an informational presentation on that from whoever is working on it, if the other commissioners are amenable.  [There seemed to be several murmurs of assent.]


Commissioner Borden:


I have two comments.  One is I was a little frustrated because I saw in the Business Times, Mornings on Two, and a couple of different other sources, a criticism of our Pet Food Express decision and Proposition G in general in relation to the formula retail legislation and whether or not it was working.  I thought it was really interesting that the portrayal was that there were more people at the hearing in support of Pet Food Express and therefore it was wrong that we didn’t vote for them.  I just want to clarify that because I think for the public they should first understand that first it is not a competition or a popularity contest.  Second, for the people who are speaking for that item had actually requested a block of time instead of having all the people from their group speak.  They actually took the opportunity to create a cohesive argument and that the other side actually read a lot of letters.  The point is that people think that we make planning decisions based on how many, or there were 20 people for and five people against – they are sorely mistaken because the Planning Code is not written that way.  The threshold is necessary or desirable and the burden was actually on the applicant and they didn’t prove it in that case and that’s how the Formula Retail legislation works.  I think it was a mis-characterization and a very unfair characterization to the public-at-large if they think that if they just pack a room with a bunch of people and read a bunch of letters regardless of where they live and what their interest is in the topic, I just think that is the wrong message to send.


On a more positive note, I want to mention that La Casina, that many of you might know, is a commercial kitchen in the 
Mission
, is an amazing project.  The whole concept is to spur primarily low income food entrepreneurs an opportunity to create food related businesses by using a commercial kitchen, which they schedule in time to use and make their food product.  They are having their annual holiday fair tomorrow from 4 to 8 p.m.  They are having all locally made products from local entrepreneurs at the 
Mission
 
Cultural
 
Center
 for the Arts, which is at about 25
th
 and Mission Streets.  I want to support that because it is a great program and we were talking about supporting local businesses.


Commissioner Antonini:


I also read that article in the Business Times.  I think there a couple of valid points they made.  One was that a number of San Francisco based businesses who began here have made the mistake to grow over ten outlets nation wide are now putting most of their businesses outside of San Francisco because of the cost of the Conditional Use process and other things that probably make it cost ineffective to put more branches here.  I’ve always felt that while this process of having the ability to perhaps deny things, I always felt that a discretionary review where the onus is on the opposition to stop the formula retail rather than the conditional use where you have to get the four votes to approve it would be a better system.  But that is not the way we have it right now.


Commissioner Lee
: 


[The speaker volume was too low to retrieve the beginning of his comments.]  … conditional use, how many actually were approved and disapproved.  More were approved than disapproved and there are still more that are pending.  We had one today that was approved.  On the whole when you look at it, it’s a pretty good process because most are actually approved.


 


 


Commissioner Miguel:


 I attended a meeting at Planning chaired by Craig Nikitas regarding the shadow study matter that he had been working on.  It was fairly well attended.  A number of people, including myself, have given recommendations as to extensive outreach, more to the parks community perhaps.  There were very few there from that community where it affects them and their interests as well as developers who did attend.  There will be two more meetings coming up.  I don’t have the dates in front of me but they are on the website.  Mr. Nikitas will work with Rec and Park and some other organizations to increase the outreach in that regard.

Director Rahaim:


Tomorrow afternoon, at the request of the Middle Polk neighborhood, I, several staff and I believe Supervisor Chiu are going to be doing a tour focusing on some recent development there.


I also was going to bring up the 
Hallidie
 
Plaza
 article and suggest that we come back to you with a briefing on that as well.  We are talking to the Mayor’s Office about the specifics of that and will get back to you.


We are starting what will essentially be a four-year process with ABAG and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission on their projections that must come out by the end of 2013.  We had the first of several meetings.  Apropos to our discussion about regional issues, I’m going to get personally more involved in that effort as well in discussing with the regional planning agencies how we can be more connected to the region and serve regional needs as well as vice versa.  It is something I am personally interested in and I know the city is wanting to be more engaged in.


Finally, I want to mention that pertinent to Commissioner Olague’s request on early budget discussion, we are going to bring to you our early thoughts about the budget and get some feedback from you in two weeks in order to have an early discussion on the budget about requests that you might have in the budget as well as just giving you some real information about the numbers as we see them today.  As you know the city has projected another deficit so we are going to be affected by that.  We will have the request that we have for what our cuts might need to be on the General Fund side as well.  We won’t know the fee side, which is of course most of our budget, until the end of December (what the real numbers are for the first half of the fiscal year).  We will at least know what our General Fund goals are and can share that with you in a couple of weeks.
