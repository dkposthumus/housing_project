 Commission Comments/Questions




Inquiries/Announcements

 Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).


Future Meetings/Agendas
.
 
 At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.




 


Commissioner Moore:


This is regarding a press release that came through Mayor Newsom's office the other day.
 
 Treasure Island is one of 16 projects world wide which is to partner with the Clinton initiative on climate-positive development, which is done in partnership with the US Green Building Council.
 
 This is a phenomenal achievement in that it is a prestigious recognition and I think it is going to get us right in the middle of a very important GREEN discussion for major development, which I believe we can derive a lot of larger scale planning and architectural decisions from as we into our other projects in the city.
 
 So congratulations to TIDA, to the Citizen's Advisory, and to everybody else.


Commissioner Miguel:


I've had discussions with people during the week regarding Transbay Terminal and various projects that hope to be proposed there, as well as with some people regarding the Saint Lucks project, CPMC, and more particularly, the entire area around the Saint Lukes site.


Commissioner Antonini
:


I also have had discussions with individuals involved with some of the Transbay Terminal projects.
 
 I also had a visit to the Sequoyas in conjunction with their possible concern about a project that may come forward I think at 1333 Gough.


Commissioner Moore:


I was at the opening of the SPUR Urban Center last night.
 
 A lovely building for all of us to see and really understand small contemporary good architecture, including what I believe is a perfect place for SPUR to continue what they do and do it well.

 DIRECTOR'S REPORT


 


5.
 
 Director's Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


On Tuesday evening, we held the fourth in a series of public workshops on the Transit Center District Plan.
 
 The primary topic on Tuesday evening was the Economic proposal, the financial program you saw here last week.
 
 There were about 60 to 70 people in attendance.
 
 Just as a reminder, we are proposing to have a complete draft of the plan out for public review starting at the end of June.
 
 We hope that the draft EIR will be completed by the end of the year.
 
 On Wednesday evening we held a public workshop on the Northeast Waterfront project that we are doing with the Port to look at urban design guidelines and public realm guidelines for that section of the waterfront north of Market and on up to North Point to include several parcels owned by the Port.
 
 We had about a hundred people in attendance.
 
 This is the first in a series of meetings.
 
 This is meant to be about an eight month planning process where we will focus very specifically on guidelines and public realm proposals for that section of the waterfront.
 
 We are working with the Port and Supervisors Chiu's office.
 
 The second of those meetings is not yet scheduled, but is likely to happen in early July.

ACTION:
 
 Approved as amended:
 
 
the following three paragraphs were added to Section 8.A of the motion starting on page 8:


The analysis of wind effects shows that the pedestrian level winds at this site will be more hazardous without this project than with it. Additional tall towers around this exceptionally windy area of the City will help reduce the number of hazard exceedances. Both wind tunnel and qualitative analysis of this project come to that conclusion.


The project seeks an exception under Section 309(a)(2) of the Planning Code, because it does not eliminate the pre-existing comfort level exceedances. Wind tunnel testing for the project identified 27 points where that level is exceeded. With the project, the comfort level exceedances are 26.
 
 No new exceedances are produced by the project and one exceedance will be eliminated.
 


The past twenty-five years of wind analysis have demonstrated that there is no feasible way that a project in a highly windy area can be designed to eliminate all pre-existing comfort level exceedances. That is why the exception process was written into the Code, and this project meets the required findings, that 1) the project cannot be shaped to meet the requirement, and 2) the limited amount of comfort exceedances, and the location, are insubstantial;


On page 19, under General Conditions G. Performance (2). the condition was changed by adding "or by legal challenge" to the end of the first sentence; Finally under Conditions Prior to Site Permit, 2.D design was amended to add three additional items as follows (change is underlined):


Configuration of retail units,


Retail storefront treatments,


Design and configuration of the public plaza at the main entry to the Fox Plaza complex.


Pedestrian level detailing


Reducing the amount of glass and refining the inverted form on the corner of Market and Hayes Streets.


The revised design shall be presented to the Planning Commission as an informational item.
