COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS


 


5.
 
 Commission Comments/Questions




Inquiries/Announcements
.
 
 Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).


Future Meetings/Agendas
.
 
 At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.




 


Commissioner Antonini:


This last couple of week I did speak with project sponsors involved with the metro Theatre conversion, and those involved with Masonic Auditorium.
 
 I also met with opponents of 1650 Broadway.
 
 He commented on and complemented Supervisor Elsbernd and ask about some of these ideas that are being brought forward.
 
 His particular idea had something to do with TIC units being moved into condo conversions at a special rate.
 
 These are people already living in these units and there is a limit of how many of these can be converted every year.
 
 The idea is that the City can benefit from the conversion fees and other taxes.
 
 It is an interesting idea and I'd like to hear more about it.
 
 I don't know if we are going to get information on that, but I put that forward to the Director and others to get information.


Commissioner Olague:


I still have some questions about the project we heard a couple of weeks ago on Polk Street – the Senior Housing project.
 
 I believe at that time the staff did have some recommendations on how we could revisit the Code and possibly recommending that all double density type projects come before the Commission for a public hearing.
 
 And there were other recommendations that I remember the staff making and giving us that day and I'd like to know if that is possible?
 
 Is that going to come back to us as an action item or is that just going to be swept under the rug and we are never going to hear about it again?


Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:


Commissioner, we are drafting legislation that we will bring back to you.
 
 We are in the process of drafting revisions to the Senior Housing proposal, which would include a variety of different options.
 
 We're looking at location criteria; we're looking at some projects being required to come back to the Commission; some projects that meet location criteria with Notice of Special Restrictions, perhaps could be approved without Commission review, but that would be something that would be before you when we bring the legislation before you.
 
 I think we have an early draft of that internally.
 
 So we are not sweeping it under the rug.


Commissioner Olague:


Great!
 
 So the NSR and the CCNR are two subjects that I hope will come up as part of that discussion.
 
 Again, public hearings are going to be something I would like to see come out of it when it comes to double density projects.
 
 The other thing:
 
 I guess DR is something we are going to be hearing about again.
 
 I know that a lot of what we hear is that part of the reason that DR Reform is being recommended is with the intention of relieving the Commission of some of the burden of having to hear those cases, and that the Commission would have more of an opportunity to weigh in on policy type issues.
 
 Is it possible to see a work program that would address how, when and if this is relieved from our calendar what other type of policy issues would be brought before us and how?
 
 If that is part of the intention, then I'd like to see how that is going to become a reality.


Director Rahaim responded:


Sure, we can do that.


Commissioner Olague:


The New Mission Theatre – we basically mirrored the veto of the Mayor.
 
 The lowering of the heights is something that occurred at the Board level.
 
 What I'm most concerned about is the process.
 
 My understanding is that it was a typo that led to the height increase.
 
 That is disturbing to me.


Director Rahaim responded:


Commissioner, that was an honest mistake by Mr. Rich.
 
 He has owned up to that mistake.
 
 He did not intend for that to happen.
 
 We had thought that since the Board had voted clearly on record for 65 feet, that that mistake could have been corrected without legislation.
 
 But the City Attorney insisted that the Board pass through legislation specifically on that item, hence the process that happened.


Commissioner Olague:


I guess I'd like to understand a little bit more.
 
 If the City Attorney could write something up?
 
 Are we planning by typo now?
 
 I was looking at the notice of preparation for that project and one of the things I noticed is that the roof top bar on the Majewel Restaurant is not legal.
 
 I want to know if this is true or not.
 
 The other thing that I was reading is that this SUD that is being proposed for the New Mission Theatre would legalize the illegal use that is currently at the Majewel Restaurant.
 
 I think that is interesting and was wondering if that was true of it is old information?


Zoning Administrator Badiner:


Commissioner, my understanding is that the Majewel rooftop bar does have both Planning Code and Building Code issues.
 
 They have submitted for a Special Use District that would address those concerns.
 
 It has always been the Department's policy that when someone is pursuing a legalization through a process, that we allow that process to happen.


Commissioner Olague:


Then basically, the SUD for the New Mission Theatre project would legalize the current use.
 
 Is that common practice?
 


Zoning Administrator Badiner:


I haven't seen the SUD recently so I'm not that familiar & 
 
 I'm talking about hearsay& 


Commissioner Olague:


Maybe I'm getting old information


Commissioner Moore:


I'm curious and supportive of the questions Commissioner Olague is asking and I think it would be for the benefit for the entire Commission to stay abreast of the interpretation of this mistake because normally there would be errata to that mistake.
 
 That I think is common practice.
 
 I want to make people aware of a communication of 1250 Missouri Street – an issue that we had discussed here a couple of weeks ago.
 
 I'm not sure if Mr. Badiner is on this distribution list, but the point is that illegal construction is on-going.
 
 On the other hand it is based on the fact that proper permits weren't filed to correct the previous mistake.
 
 Mr. Badiner could you just briefly comment on that for the public because there has been a stream of emails that have come across our desks?


Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:


Yes, Ms. Bendix did a site visit earlier this week because the issue had come up.
 
 This is not on calendar so I'll just do a brief response.
 
 It appears that they have responded to all of the Commissions concerns.
 
 We are following up with DBI about whether new permits need to be filed to memorialize that and then we are going to bring this back to you as an informational item or a memorandum.
 
 We do believe that they have done all the items.
 
 There is access to the upper levels; the bathtubs have been removed; the kitchens have been split.
 
 That is all I want to say without it being on calendar.
 
 We are gratified that it seems to working, but we do not have a permit that does that.
 
 So in talking to DBI - they just revert us back to the original permits.
 
 Do they not need a permit to do that or what?
 
 We are just trying to figure out the paper work correctly.


Commissioner Sugaya:


Just to follow up on Commissioners Moore and Olague on Mission Street, can't we simply initiate a re-zoning of that parcel to bring it back down to 65 feet?
 
 Why can't we downzone to where it is suppose to be?


Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:


Commissioner, I think this will come back to you because if I recall correctly one of the Board's requests was to re-examine the heights along Mission Street even before this happened.
 
 We have a six month process to do that and the results will be brought to you and you can certainly take into account whether ultimately it should be 85 or 65 feet.


Commissioner Sugaya:


Are there any projects on hold during this period?
 
 I think we should initiate re-zoning and be done with it.
 
 Is there anything to prevent us from doing that?


Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:


No, I don't believe there is anything to prevent you from initiating that re-zoning.


Commissioner Sugaya:


Then how do we do that formally?


Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:


Let me get you an answer to that.
 
 Whether what you've said is enough direction or whether we have to have a hearing to initiate.
 
 I think we do have to have a hearing to initiate, but if it's the Commission's direction to staff to start preparing that, that is what we need to know.


Commissioner Antonini:


Not getting into a discussion on this at this point, but this has come before us once before and I believe we voted on it.
 
 I don't remember exactly when that occurred.
 
 If it is the wish of the Board of Supervisors that it come back then of course it would.
 
 But I don't know that we necessarily have to initiate before that time.


Director Rahaim responded:


It is your prerogative to initiate legislation if you wish to.
 
 We don't do that often.
 
 There needs to be an action and a vote by the Commission.


Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:


Commissioner, Ms. Rodgers has alerted me that she is going to make a report on this issue under Board of Supervisor's matters and you might want to take it up under that.


Commissioner Sugaya:


I'd also like staff to consider having a report on the Historic Preservation Commission activities.
 
 Lastly, I noticed that on the Historical Resource Review form that the Department is using with respect to historic resources and potential issues on proposed projects that step one exemption class only lists class 1 and class 3.
 
 I wonder why it doesn't list class 31.
 
 You don't have to answer that now, but if I could get something back in the future I would appreciate it.


Commissioner Moore:


I would like to ask that the Academy of Art be re-introduced.
 
 We haven't heard about it for a long time – the hotel room ordinance(?)
 
 I would like to get a feeling of where the overall process is going – just a little check list.
 
 I think it is important that we stay abreast of this.


Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:


Can we start with a memo and go from there?


 


Commissioner Moore:


Yes


Commissioner Olague:


Along the lines of what Commissioner Sugaya said, maybe we can have a joint hearing with the Preservation Commission.
 
 Maybe that would be a couple of months away.
 
 This is just a suggestion.


Commissioner Borden:


I noticed that on the draft for a future meeting there is an item on large tourist hotels, but what about hotel conversions – SRO and tourist hotel room conversions to residential use.
 
 Do we look at that?


Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:


That is a separate issued and unrelated.
 
 That is under the jurisdiction of the Department of Building Inspection Housing.
 
 If you would like and as your schedule allows, we could get some information on the Residential Hotels.


Commissioner Borden:


That would be great


Commissioner Lee
:


We had discussions about joint hearings and special presentations and I would like President Miguel to work with the staff and at least give us a forward calendar so we'll know when it is that BIC, Commission on the Environment, MTA and Small Business will happen.
 
 What I'd like to do is maybe over the next few weeks have the President and Vice President put together a schedule for the next six months so we'll have a sense of when they will happen for informational presentations.
 
 Secondly, we used to get as part of our package every week a listing of questions from the commissioners with responses and timelines.
 
 Recently I haven't seen that.
 
 I know we ask a lot of questions.
 
 Sometimes we get a written report and sometimes we don't.
 
 But frankly I don't remember on some of the questions I have asked that staff have responded to.
 
 So hopefully we can get that.


Commissioner Miguel:


I'd like to mention that I have been in the process of meeting with each of the members of the Board of Supervisors to see what planning issues they have in mind that will be coming up in the future.
 
 I should complete the eleven members within the next couple of weeks is scheduling permits.
 
 I have met with people from the Metro, the Masonic, and Fell and Franklin regarding their particular projects.
 
 I am following up on the Senior and Disabled housing.
 
 I've had a number of conversations with people very experienced in the real estate community and believe that transmitting my information through the Department, that the Department is very much in line with what has to be done in that regard.
 
 I have also spoken with the Department about the next joint meeting with DBI.
 
 Hopefully we can get that scheduled sometime in March; the same thing with the Historic Preservation Commission.
 
 They are just getting started, but as they get up and running we can meet with their officers and schedule something for the future.

 Director's Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


This week I attended a monthly meeting of the Housing Action Coalition.
 
 I also attended a meeting of the building Owners and Managers Association at their monthly luncheon meeting.
 
 I wanted to give you an update of the Housing Element work.
 
 We have completed the first phase of the outreach.
 
 The Community Advisory body has completed its meetings.
 
 The next phase of that work is we'll go into a series of stake holders sessions and neighborhood outreach meetings.
 
 We expect 20 to 30 of those meetings over the next three to four months on various topics and various venues all around the city.
 
 We are putting out invitations to community groups that if they are interested in having us come to various parts of the city to talk about the Housing Element we are prepared to do that over the next three to four months.

 Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals


 


BOARD OF SUPERVISORS


 


Land Use (last week):




483 Bosworth Street
 
rezoning from public (P) to RH-2 
(Continued)


Interim zoning moratorium on tobacco paraphernalia establishments in the Haight Street NCD.
 
 This was continued until the Supervisor could introduce an ordinance that would require a CU to establish these establishments (
continued to next week)


Converting Hayes Street from one way to a two way street 
(continued to next week)




 


Full Board (this week):




Veto override consideration –
 
The Mayor vetoed an item that would have corrected a clerical error considering a map height for the New Mission Theatre.
 
 You heard that item on August 7, 2008.
 
 At that time the Planning Commission recommended 85 feet for the length of Mission Street.
 
 When the Board's Land Use Committee heard the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan, they lowered the heights along Mission Street to 65 feet except for two properties which represent these theatre parcels, which they recommended keeping at 85 feet
 
 On November 24, the full Board voted lowering the height along Mission Street to 65 feet for both of those theatres.
 
 It was already 65 feet for the rest of Mission Street and they voted to lower it for the two theatres.
 
 It was after this hearing that planning staff erroneously did not amend the zoning height map for that New Mission Theatre parcel and the Board subsequently adopted the ordinance with that mistake in it.
 
 The Board realized that and introduced a correcting piece of legislation that would again lower the height on the New Mission Theatre from 85 feet to 65 feet.
 
 This was the legislation that was vetoed and considered by the full Board for override.
 
 This week the full Board did not have the two thirds votes necessary to override that veto so the original 85 feet was the height that was retained.


That is my report for the Board of Supervisors.
 
 I was asked to address a little bit of the Market/Octavia CAC:
 
 Just this week the Mayor announced his potential members for the CAC and that completes the final compliment.
 
 The Board had already put forward their names.
 
 Staff is working with the City Attorney to develop appropriate noticing and work with the new CAC members.
 
 We expect to have the first meeting of the CAC within the month.




 


BOARD OF APPEALS


 




456 Urbano Drive
 
– The Planning Commission this as a triple DR and I heard the variance on December 20, 2007.
 
 One of those DRs was staff initiated because the project sponsor didn't reduce the scope and was not in compliance with the Residential Design Guidelines. One of the DRs filed from the adjacent neighbor at 450 Urbana was about shading on solar panels.
 
 At the hearing before you, planning staff demonstrated that there would not be significant shading to the solar panels.
 
 You did take discretionary review to reduce the size of the building but did not address the solar issues.
 
 The DR requestor did appeal your decision seeking compensation for the loss of the electrical production caused by the project.
 
 It was a three to one vote, with Goh dissenting to uphold your decision finding that there was not significant solar shading.




 


 


Historic Preservation Commission


 


Yesterday, the Historic Preservation Commission held their first meeting.
 
 There are four commissioners – Charles Chase, Courtney Damkroger, Karl Hasz and Alan Martinez.
 
 Linda Avery served as the Commission Secretary.
 
 The first rule of business was to get some rules of order in place so they could start acting.
 
 They did adopt some rules and voted to have an interim President and Vice President and will re-visit election of officers after the 6
th
 member is seated.
 
 They voted Charles Chase as President and Courtney Damkroger as Vice President.
 
 Then they proceeded to go through calendar.
 
 They had a very robust calendar including an item that you will here a little later – the re-write of Articles 10 & 11.
 
 They also heard several EIRs and CEQA reviews, a Mills Act contract and two Certificate of Appropriateness applications.
 
 They had a full calendar and are up and running.

SPEAKERS: 
Bob Planthold
 – regarding the factual accuracy, validity and completeness of statements recently made by planning staff at a public hearing before another body here in the city on January 11 at the Appeals Board.
 
 A person representing the Zoning Administrator said regarding a case that the ADA doesn't apply.
 
 Just that simple oral statement.
 
 Nothing was said by that person about criteria used to analyze why it didn't apply.
 
 That person also said that the California Fair Housing and Employment Act doesn't apply.
 
 That person also claimed to have talked with staff that same day, January 11, at the Mayor's Office of Disability and claimed to have been told by staff at the Mayor's Office of Disability that the ADA didn't apply.
 
 I went through the upper management at MOD.
 
 Nobody recalls having had a conversation with that staffer.
 
 Nobody recalls ever making a statement that ADA doesn't apply.
 
 But by making a statement that ADA doesn't apply or that the California Fair Housing and Employment Act doesn't apply, the Board of Appeals might have relied on upon the claimed professionalism of that staffer and made a decision in error.
 
 There is a whole title of ADA that staff and City Attorney often ignore.
 
 There is a duty of the department to respond to a claim of disability even if it's not a question of code or structure, or of gradiance.
 
 If there is a claim of disability you have to analyze and respond.
 
 Nothing said by that staffer indicated that there was any analysis by Planning staff about that code aspect.
 
 That person didn't respond to that claim.
 
 That person might not have been aware of it.
 
 You have a problem with ADA responsiveness.
 


Sue Hestor
 
– Both the Building Inspection Commission and the Board of Appeals solicit public response.
 
 Planning doesn't.
 
 Not this kind of response – little forms saying  what did we do wrong,   how can we improve how we do our business? 
 
 Both of them deal with the same kind of projects you deal with.
 
 There is no institutionalized feedback mechanism from people that are here, that are at the Department, that deal with you on the phone to say here is something that should be commended; here is something that I don't understand; here is something that you should improve.
 
 I think that would be a good idea.
 
 My second thing, I am probably the lay person most familiar with the conditions of your records because I go through them a lot.
 
 I talked to Ms. Avery about this and told her I was going to bring this up today.
 
 You really don't have a coherent policy for managing your records.
 
 Case records are all over the place in terms of how they are organized.
 
 Some persons case files are perfect.
 
 They are well organized, they are in file forms; from others you get a box of loose papers.
 
 Files get lost.
 
 Most of it comes through Mr. Badiner's side of the Department because that is where all the cases come from.
 
 It is hard to understand who is responsible. 
 
I'm going to talk to the budget people about.
 
 I'm asking you to have a structure and have some responsibility.
 
 MEA is responsible for its files.
 
 I don't know who is responsible for giving directives in project case files.
 
 We should have a system and someone responsible for tracking.
 
 Other cities have ways of tracking their files; control sheets; something.
