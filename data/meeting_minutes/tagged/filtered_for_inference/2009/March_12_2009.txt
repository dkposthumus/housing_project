COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS


 


4.
 
 Commission Comments/Questions




Inquiries/Announcements
.
 
 Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).


Future Meetings/Agendas
.
 
 At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.




 


Commissioner Antonini:


He thanked Tom Radulovich for sending him an article that has to do with low cost design approach for lightrail.
 
 It deals with what has been done in Portland and Seattle and Charlotte to keep the cost of lightrail down.
 
 Basically is a design to budget philosophy.
 
 Where possible it tries to use existing pavement and put the streetcar lines into there.
 
 It sometimes makes the stop shorter and a lot of other steps that are innovative and have worked well in these areas.
 
 I hope it is something we can explore in the future.
 
 Geneva is a street that might lend itself to this type of thing.


Commissioner Olague:


In light of A. F. Even filed Chapter 11, is 55 Laguna going forward?


Commissioner Miguel responded:


I talked to staff there and it is definitely going forward.
 
 From what I understand, it will not be affected.


Commissioner Olague:


I'd like to know who I can talk to directly about that because I'm a little bit concerned.
 
 I want to know what the timeframe is.
 
 There was a lot of pressure around that whole project.
 
 So if you can give someone's name and number that would be great.
 
 110 Embarcadero â€“ I saw some emails go through, was it harry Bridges?
 
 Something about the labor Council had some concerns about the environment document; about it being a historic resource.
 
 Have you heard anything about it?
 
 Someone asked and I wouldn't know.


Commissioner Miguel:


The confusion occurred and it wasn't brought up earlier because that address had been the Steuart side address.
 
 So no one caught it from the labor movement at the time.
 
 That was the reason for the confusion.


Zoning Administrator Badiner responds
:


I understand that has been appealed.
 
 There was some discussion before the Planning Commission about the labor history and plaques and stuff like that.


Commissioner Borden
:


I think we all saw in the paper about the historic cottage on Lombard Street that is falling down.
 
 A number of people have emailed me and I wasn't clear about what the status of that property is.


Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:


I became aware of this Thursday or Friday last week.
 
 This is an historic building that was built in 1860.
 
 A cottage set back from the street with a magnolia tree in the front and steeply down sloping and steeply laterally sloping.
 
 It was the subject of a development proposal about five or six years ago.
 
 It was determined that it was an historic structure and I don't think the project sponsor pursued it because it would have required an EIR.
 
 But it was not a designated landmark.
 
 I believe it is listed in Here Today.
 
 It is clearly a resource.
 
 Apparently neighbors complained that they heard a noise, crashing or something like that.
 
 DBI went out and the project sponsor hired Mr. Buscovich to look at the project.
 
 I went out on Tuesday.
 
 The back floors have literally dropped into below the building.
 
 DBI has looked it and has declared an eminent safety hazard.
 
 An eminent safety hazard is a hazard that something could collapse or be damaged or could into the street or hurt someone and the only way to address that is through demolition.
 
 If there is a way to shore a building up, you don't get a demolition permit, you get a shoring permit or something like that.
 
 In DBI's estimation the only way to ensure public safety is through demolition of the project.
 
 The Zoning Administrator (myself) is in a consultative role.
 
 I signed off on the permit in consultation.
 
 I don't believe I have the power to say you can't issue this demolition permit.
 
 It is a safety issue that is properly within the Department of Building Inspection.
 
 I suspect that building will be demolished in the next day or so.
 
 I don't know if the permit has literally been issued because it was brought to my desk this morning for sign off.
 
 It was hand carried around, which is typical in an eminent safety hazard issue.


Commissioner Borden:


Did the floor just crash recently?
 
 Is that why it is an eminent safety hazard?


Zoning Administrator Badiner:


The floor just crashed recently is my understanding.
 
 I can't verify that.
 
 Apparently, neighbors heard a noise and called DBI.
 
 I don't have the detailed history of that.
 
 There has obviously been some concern from the preservation community.
 
 There is some discussion about being that it was a balloon-framed building and whether it could be repaired.
 
 DBI does not believe that it can be.
 
 The fear is that this building crashes and it crashes into the adjacent buildings.
 
 There is some speculation, perhaps well founded, that this building was allowed to deteriorate.


Commissioner Borden:


Was there a permit for work at all pulled on that project?


Zoning Administrator Badiner:


I believe, and I'm going back into my memory, there were a couple of permits pulled in 2005 or 2006 for foundation work and for shear work.
 
 I was not in the building.
 
 People who were in the building ran out of the building because it is literally moving.
 
 You can hear it creaking.
 
 I was told when I went out there to stand over here.
 
 Don't stand over there.
 
 When it goes, it's going over there.
 
 That is how concerned people are about it. 
 
This is not the sort of thing that if we wait around three or four month to discuss it that we can assure public safety.


Commissioner Borden:


In 2005 when the permits were issued, was the property in that condition at that point?


Zoning Administrator Badiner:


I can't tell you that and I can't tell you if they did any work.
 
 I will say also that Commissioner Debra Walker (Building Inspection Commission) was out there.
 
 Senior members of the Building Department were out there looking at it.
 
 Private structural engineers were out there, and I believe a public structural engineer was out there.
 
 The consensus was that this building needs to come down.
 
 About neglect and such, I think there will be further discussions as we move forward on that issue.


Commissioner Sugaya:


Commissioner Miguel and I were at a steering committee meeting for the Japantown Neighborhood Plan Tuesday late afternoon.
 
 The sole topic was a study of the Japantown Center that 3D purchased a number of years ago.
 
 At that time 3D was engaged in developing some scenarios for how they saw the future development of the property.
 
 Given the economic down turn, 3D has now basically halted any further work with respect to what might be expected in the future.
 
 This study then took basically some of the ideas 3D had for the Center and did both a massing and scale and shadow study for different development scenarios as well as economic studies of whether those scenarios could pencil out for a developer.
 
 I guess in summary you could say that none of those scenarios presented penciled out if you were a private developer and assuming the developer would retain about 15%, in which we were reminded was a low rate of return for a developer in the first place.
 
 But I think that even the most dense proposal that was looked at \, which included a 24-story high rise residential building only returned about 1%.
 
 There will be future meetings that will address other issues like urban design and some presentation on the heritage aspects and other parts of the plan.


Commissioner Miguel:


I had not been involved with the Japantown study for a few years when I met with them because of the impact of the possible Geary BRT.
 
 This is the second meeting of the Japantown group that I have attended.
 
 They get excellent attendance and array of interested parties involved.
 
 I will say that the Planning Department staff have done an excellent job and obviously have a great deal of support and respect from the Japantown group itself.
 
 I found interesting the fact that here are all these scenarios and none of them pan out economically.
 
 But that does not mean that they have finished with their review of what can or may happen and they are still involved with transit that's planned for Geary BRT.
 
 I'm sure Commissioner will follow it.
 
 I am going to try to follow it.
 
 And at some point it will come before this Commission as an informational review.


Commissioner Moore:


I attended a meeting last Thursday after our Planning Commission meeting at Grace Cathedral where a large number of people showed up to comment on the changes proposed for the Masonic Auditorium.
 
 It was amazing that within 20 to 50 feet distance, there were about 200 people who showed up.
 
 It made me realize how dense the neighborhood is and those are people who normally do not show up here.
 
 It was quite informative to hear their concerns and to have a presentation where people spoke in a concise way about what they will be organizing to present to us at some point.


Commissioner Miguel.


I might mention that Live Nation's website shows my email and phone and David Chiu's email and phone.
 
 We have been quite inundated for some time.
 
 And also for that project, I have asked the Director if the Department would prepare in some detail a transit study as a baseline of information that this Commission will need before we even start to proceed further on it.


Commissioner Moore
:


Which will hopefully be paid for by Live Nation.


Commissioner Antonini:


In terms of visits, I did visit with DR requestors and neighbors on Lyon Street in connection with 2608 Post, which will be with us later today.
 
 I spoke with the project sponsor on 4024 26
th
 Street and also met with one of the project sponsors for a project that will be before us in the next couple of weeks at 430 Main/429 Beal.


Commissioner Miguel:


I also met with the people on Post Street and 26
th
 Street.
 
 The other thing I wanted to mention was two articles from the [March 8
th
] New York Times Magazine has two articles that were of interest that are in our purview.
 
 One is  All Boarded Up,  and it deals with foreclosures.
 
 The other one is  Share My Ride,  which deals with care share.

 DIRECTOR'S REPORT

 Director's Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


On Monday evening, I attended the monthly meeting of the North Beach Neighbors Community Association.
 
 That was attended by 35 people or so and had a broad range of discussions about issues pertaining to North Beach and about discretionary review (DR).
 
 On the Japantown Plan, staff is reminding me that we are planning to be here in a couple of weeks to give you a brief update on the status.
 
 Then probably in April or early May, a much more full blown presentation on that plan as well.
 
 We hope to get completed by the end of the first half of the year.
 
 Finally, I do want to spend a couple of minutes on the status of our work on Articles 10 & 11.
 
 Tara Sullivan is here as well.
 
 She has prepared a memo for you that was completed just this morning â€“ a revised schedule.
 
 The earlier schedule that we distributed with our proposed strategy for dealing with these two articles did assume an extension on the 90-day comment period from the Board.
 
 The Board has not been willing to grant that extension so we have now revised the schedule so we can prepare this revised legislation in time for your consideration by the middle of April.
 
 You'll see that we are maintaining the advisory [working] group that we have established.
 
 We have three more meetings as well as a joint hearing with you and the Historic Preservation Commission.


Tara Sullivan:


April 14 is now our deadline, about a month from now.
 
 Like the Director said, we are having our next working group meeting number 2 on Monday.
 
 Next Wednesday, the Historic Preservation Commission is having a hearing with an extended public comment period so we are encouraging a lot of people to come to that hearing and speak to the Preservation Commission on their thoughts for Articles 10 & 11.
 
 On March 30, there will be a working group meeting number 3.
 
 On March 26, I will bring forward a very detailed informational presentation on the legislation itself and the Department's proposed changes.
 
 April 2 will be the joint hearing between the Planning and Preservation Commissions that will start at 10 a.m.
 
 Monday, the 6
th
 of April will be the 4
th
 and final working group meeting.
 
 Wednesday, April 8
th
, there will be a special hearing scheduled with the Historic Preservation Commission for their final recommendations and actions on the Board legislation.
 
 The next day, on April 9
th
, will be the follow up and final consideration for recommendations and actions by this commission on the Board legislation.
 
 Then it will be finalized and rolled up and sent back to the Board in time for April 14
th
.
 
 The working group meets at the Planning Department offices at 1650 Mission Street in one of our conference rooms at 4:30 in the afternoon.


Zoning Administrator Badiner


I want to talk about the Eastern Neighborhoods Implementation process.
 
 Staff has been meeting internally very continuously since the Eastern Neighborhoods became effective on January 19 of this year.
 
 The Eastern Neighborhoods team from Citywide has conducted a series of trainings for the Neighborhood Planning staff.
 
 The Eastern Neighborhoods transportation/trip study has gotten underway.
 
 We are starting work on a focused Showplace Square open space study as promised during the adoption language.
 
 Staff is also working with various agencies on the affordable housing and open space issues at 17
th
 7 Folsom, and we are working with the city's implementation agencies on infrastructure issues.
 
 Further, on an internal basis, both a select group from Eastern Neighborhoods Citywide group and NP group have been going through the code on an implementation basis looking at the pipeline projects and all other issues as we go through, and obviously on an 1800 page document, there will potentially be some issues that might need clean up.
 
 We will be coming back to you on April 23
rd
 for a full report on all of these items, but also we will probable have a scheme proposed for how to address the corrections.
 
 It will be a combination of Zoning Administrator's Bulletin and ultimately, clean up legislation.
 
 We don't want to do 14 clean up legislations every time we discover something.
 
 We want to allow time for many of the issues to surface.
 
 We would obviously have information in your packets before then.
