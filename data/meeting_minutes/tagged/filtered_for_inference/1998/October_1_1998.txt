		You are invited to a public workshop to be held on Saturday, October 17, 1998 from 9:00 AM to
4:30 PM at the California College of Arts and Crafts (CCAC) building located at 450 Irwin Street
in the Showplace Square area.    The Citywide Land Use Study workshop will include a

by public participation in the development of objectives for accommodating housing, industry
and commerce in San Francisco.  You will be asked to provide your own lunch.  In the
afternoon session, participants will be asked to join small groups to focus on specific topics
which may include: (1) location, design and affordability of new housing types including
residential lofts, Single Room Occupancy (SRO) units and live/work units; (2) location, density,
height and scale of housing along transit corridors; (3) providing affordable housing for artists;
(4) providing land for industry, including multi-media, medical research and other emerging
industry types; (5) providing amenities in emerging neighborhoods, including open space,
convenience shopping, parking, transit and other public services; and (6) enforcement and
public notice procedures.  The small group sessions are designed to be "brainstorming"
sessions where you are encouraged to provide creative, yet feasible ideas and
recommendations.  All the comments and ideas at the end of the afternoon session will be
summarized and Department staff will conduct further research in the coming months before
preparing recommendations for Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors' actions.

BICYCLE TRANSIT ENHANCEMENT PLAN
,
 Consideration of a proposal to amend the
Planning Code (Zoning Ordinance) by amending Section 155.1 to clarify definition of and
obligations of the responsible City official and the landlord regarding the provision of bicycle
facilities in or for building space leased to the City and deleting obsolete implementation
schedule provisions.  The amendment would add Section 155.2 to require bicycle parking in
privately-owned and City-owned parking garages, and would add Section 155.3 to require
shower and locker facilities be provided in or for new buildings and buildings undergoing major
expansion.  Planning Code Section 155(j) already requires bicycle spaces in required
accessory auto parking facilities.  There is no auto parking requirement for uses other than
residential use in the C-3 (Downtown Commercial) Districts, so no bicycle parking is required or
would be required by this amendment in downtown buildings except in residential buildings and
buildings primarily used as parking garages.

		You are invited to a public workshop to be held on Saturday, October 17, 1998 from 9:00 AM to
4:30 PM at the California College of Arts and Crafts (CCAC) building located at 450 Irwin Street
in the Showplace Square area.    The Citywide Land Use Study workshop will include a

by public participation in the development of objectives for accommodating housing, industry
and commerce in San Francisco.  You will be asked to provide your own lunch.  In the
afternoon session, participants will be asked to join small groups to focus on specific topics
which may include: (1) location, design and affordability of new housing types including
residential lofts, Single Room Occupancy (SRO) units and live/work units; (2) location, density,
height and scale of housing along transit corridors; (3) providing affordable housing for artists;
(4) providing land for industry, including multi-media, medical research and other emerging
industry types; (5) providing amenities in emerging neighborhoods, including open space,
convenience shopping, parking, transit and other public services; and (6) enforcement and
public notice procedures.  The small group sessions are designed to be "brainstorming"
sessions where you are encouraged to provide creative, yet feasible ideas and
recommendations.  All the comments and ideas at the end of the afternoon session will be
summarized and Department staff will conduct further research in the coming months before
preparing recommendations for Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors' actions.

AMENDMENTS TO THE MID-MARKET AND YERBA BUENA REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT
AREA PRELIMINARY PLANS
; Assessor's Block 3705, Lots 9,10, 12,13, 14, 15,17, 18, 33, 38
and 43, and Assessor's Block 3724, Lot 67, comprising the central portion of two City Blocks
located between Market and Mission Streets and between 4th and 5th Streets and the entire
City Block located between Mission and Minna Streets and between 4th and 5th Streets.
Consideration of a proposed amendment to the Mid-Market and Yerba Buena Center (YBC)
Redevelopment Project Area Preliminary Plans and finding of consistency of the proposed
amendment with the General Plan, as it is proposed to be amended, and finding of
consistency with Section 101.1 of the Planning Code. The proposed Preliminary Plan
amendment would expand the boundaries of the YBC Project Area, facilitating the
development of the land to be added to the YBC Project Area for mixed use. The purpose of
the amendment is to enable the City and Redevelopment Agency to study the appropriateness
of using redevelopment powers to facilitate development within the expanded area. The
designation of the expanded area under Redevelopment Agency jurisdiction and development
of a project would require certification of an EIR, map amendments to Urban Design,
Commerce and Industry, and the Downtown elements of the General Plan to partially vacate
the Jessie Street right-of-way, to change the current Height and Bulk districts to allow higher
buildings, amendment of the YBC Redevelopment Plan and amendment to the YBC Design
for Development document, all of which would be the subject of later hearings before the
Planning Commission, the Redevelopment Commission and the Board of Supervisors. The
site is currently within C-3-R (Downtown Retail) and P (Public) Districts and the following
Height and Bulk Districts: 120-X, 160-S and 160-F.
