CHERRY DAM FUSE GATE PROJECT.
 Appeal of Preliminary Negative Declaration. Hetch
Hetchy Water and Power is proposing to increase the maximum storage capacity of Cherry
Lake (Tuolumne County) in the amount of 11,600 acre-feet, from 273,500 acre-feet. This
increase in storage would be accomplished by replacing the existing two and one-half foot
high flash boards with a series of 26 steel fuse gates, approximately nine feet high,
placed side-by-side across the 320 foot wide Cherry Valley Dam spillway. This would allow
Hetch Hetchy to raise the lake level six and one-half feet from elevation 4702.5 feet to
4709.0 feet above mean sea level. 


(Continued from Regular Meeting of December 11, 1997) 


NOTE:
 The hearing on the appeal of the preliminary Negative Declaration
for the Cherry Dam Fuse Gate project is canceled. The environmental assessment process
will further study the potential physical effects of the project. After a new draft
document is produced, it will be recirculated to interested parties.

CASKET STORES DEFINITION AMENDMENT
: Consideration of a proposal to amend
Sections 227, 790.62 and 890.62 of the Planning Code (Zoning Ordinance) to include, in the
definition of "mortuary", casket stores and other retail establishments that
sell or offer for sale exclusively funerary goods. The effect of the proposal would be to
remove casket stores from the general retail store use category under the Planning Code
and subject it to the same Planning Code controls that apply to mortuaries. Generally,
this would reduce the number of 


















zoning districts where casket stores could be established, either as a permitted use or
as a conditional use, since mortuaries are allowed as a permitted or conditional use in
fewer zoning districts than are general retail stores.
