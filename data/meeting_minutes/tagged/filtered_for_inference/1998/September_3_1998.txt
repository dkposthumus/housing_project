BICYCLE TRANSIT ENHANCEMENT PLAN
,
 Consideration of a proposal to amend the
Planning Code (Zoning Ordinance) by amending Section 155.1 to clarify definition of and
obligations of the responsible City official and the landlord regarding the provision of bicycle
facilities in or for building space leased to the City and deleting obsolete implementation
schedule provisions.  The amendment would add Section 155.2 to require bicycle parking in
privately-owned and City-owned parking garages, and would add Section 155.3 to require
shower and locker facilities be provided in or for new buildings and buildings undergoing major
expansion.  Planning Code Section 155(j) already requires bicycle spaces in required accessory
auto parking facilities.  There is no auto parking requirement for uses other than residential use
in the C-3 (Downtown Commercial) Districts, so no bicycle parking is required or would be
required by this amendment in downtown buildings except in residential buildings and buildings
primarily used as parking garages.
