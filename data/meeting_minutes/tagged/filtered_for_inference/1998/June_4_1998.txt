Budget outcome at BOS Finance Committee to this point: The

recommended that the Department be allowed to keep its funding--at least
instructed  the Budget Analyst (Mr. Harvey Rose) to meet the Department half
way.  Original proposal was $8,877,368. The Board approved $8,688,187 -- 20%
over last year (or current fiscal year).  This means a slight increase in fees and an
approximate $284,000 additional General Fund increase, allowing the Department
to fill four new positions -- 2 in Environmental Review and 2 in Neighborhood
Planning.
