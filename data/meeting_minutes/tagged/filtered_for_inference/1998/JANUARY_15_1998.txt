DISPOSAL AND REUSE OF THE FORMER NAVAL SHIPYARD AT HUNTERS POINT
 -- 
Public
Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report.
 The
proposed federal action discussed in the Draft EIS/EIR is the disposal of federal surplus
land at the former Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco, California. The document
also considers the impacts of the Reuse Plan, developed by the City and County of San
Francisco and the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency, as well as a Reduced Development
alternative and the required No Action alternative. The Proposed Reuse Plan would be
implemented by the Hunters Point Shipyard Redevelopment Plan (also called the
Redevelopment Plan), and emphasizes mixed use of the site, including residential,
industrial, maritime industrial, cultural, institutional, mixed use, research and
development, and open space uses. Implementation of the Proposed Reuse Plan may require
changes to the San Francisco General Plan (including the addition of a new Hunters Point
Shipyard Area Plan), and changes to Bay Conservation and Development Commission's Bay Plan
and to their Seaport Plan.
