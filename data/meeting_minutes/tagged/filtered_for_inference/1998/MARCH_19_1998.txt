SPEAKERS: Gram Wyatt, David Madway, Amy Nonched
 


ACTION: Approved as modified: 


4) The original intent of the Planning Code in limiting signs to under 100 feet
    above grade was to avoid a proliferation of brightly lit, roof-level signs throughout the
    downtown, competing with each other and obscuring the overall form of the skyline,
    particularly at night. However, San Francisco has a tradition of allowing corporate
    identity signs of locally-based and founded corporations (Ghiradelli, Pacific Bell, Hills
    Brothers). Since the sign is incised and indirectly illuminated, it appearance is subdued.
    A very limited number of signs of subdued nature would not be in conflict with the intent
    of the General Plan and the Planning Code.
