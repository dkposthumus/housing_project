PUBLIC NOTICE




for:


Census 2000 Statistical Areas Program
 
Maps Available for Review






For tabulation purposes, the Census Bureau divides San Francisco into statistical areas
that include block groups which in turn are aggregated into census tracts.  For Census
2000, some changes need to be made to certain statistical areas to meet Census Bureau
population and boundary line requirements.  The Planning Department has reviewed the
identified areas and made alterations as needed.  These amended maps will be available
for public review at the Planning Department, 1660 Mission Street, 5th floor.  The review
dates are November 30 (10 am to 1 pm), December 1 (10 am to 1 pm), and December 2
(1 pm to 4 pm).  




Contact Charlotte Barham at 558-6252 If you wish to participate in this process or have any
questions.
