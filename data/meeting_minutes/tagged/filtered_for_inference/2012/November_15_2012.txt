COMMISSIONERS’ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
 


 


7.         Commission Comments/Questions




 


Commissioner Borden:


I spoke about this with Ms. Rodgers in regard to the CEQA Legislation, in terms of the legislation we have with the awnings, that Supervisor Chiu has put forth, I thought it was great, in policy, things are changing the Planning Code and things like CEQA, that is going to affect this Commission. If we could have informational hearings early on in the introduction process, that would be non-action hearings, where we could understand the issues, they would be non-action hearings, because I feel a lot of times, for legislation we get packets and we do not understand, sometimes, until we have the hearing, what the legislation is saying,  so I think it would be really useful if we get a hearing early, and have a second hearing closer to end of the window where we could vote on the legislation, because I think we can figure out in between, if we need to have additional community workshops.  A lot of people feel that the Planning Commission should be the one to change legislation in regard to the Planning Code, and CEQA, that follows into that area.


I thought about the housing efficiency units. One of the things I thought might be useful as we are talking about looking at housing, building market rate versus affordable.  It would be interesting to have an actual snapshot of a cost per sq. ft. in a particular neighborhood. I do not think in the abstract.  Just knowing you are building a market rate project, tells you anything who can afford to live in that project.  I think having a snapshot actually show what the medium home price was in that particular neighborhood, smaller real estate tracks around that project, and then the anticipated cost per sq. ft. for that project and then you can better assess the market. We had a conversation about whether the market fulfills any level of middle income housing, it would be good to know that.  I think just having a general report about units, does not get to the heart of what we are trying to solve.  So, a better way, kind of incorporating looking at price per sq. ft. in a given neighborhood and comparing that to projects coming online, to the extent that we can, it would be more useful information.


Commissioner Antonini:


I would agree a 100% with Commissioner Borden’s request, because categorizing things as market rate or affordable, we had an instance a couple years ago where many of the market rate units for sale, were being sold for less than would have been the inclusionary amount that would have been charged under the inclusionary ordinance.  It is important to see, real case situations, and understand what we are really talking about in terms of the case.


A couple of other items, in terms of the Commission Secretary Search, I am still waiting for word from DHR, in regard to the classification issue, and I am hopeful that I would hear something on that issue within the next few days and follow up with that to see where we are.


Commissioner Moore:


The former home of Local 3879 International Longshoreman Association has bought the building to accommodate the Commonwealth Club in that facility, it its great idea. Commonwealth used to be on Market and Second, and now they will be moving to this location, which I think is an appropriate way of bringing large well-known institutional uses onto the waterfront.


 


 


D.         DIRECTOR’S REPORT


 


8.         Director’s Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


There had been some requests, to talk about the schedule for the proposed Arena project on Piers 30 and 32. Just want to report some dates. After discussion with President Fong and Vice-President Wu we agree that we will have an informational hearing in January, when we would have some better answers to some questions at that point. We would schedule that on your calendar. As you know the Board is currently considering the fiscal feasibility for the project.  That allows us to start working on the EIR.  We are anticipating that the draft EIR will be published in May.  Your hearing on the draft EIR would probably be in June and the schedule calls for the completion of the EIR if you consider the certification by the end of next year.  We are about a year away from completing that project.


Secondly, I just want to let you know that I will be out the office for two weeks and Bill Wycko will be in charge for the Department in my absence. 


            


9.         Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.


 


LAND USE COMMITTEE: No Hearing




                                                          




FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: 




The Board heard the POPOS Signage Ordinance, 
sponsored by Supervisor Chiu. This item was heard and approved with modifications by this Commission on June 7th.  Supervisor Chiu adopted all Planning Commission’s modifications. After the Planning Commission hearing, the Supervisor’s Office and Planning Staff worked closely with MOD staff to make sure that the ZA bulletin’s dimension and graphic requirements reflect the ADA standards. This week
 the Board passed the Ordinance on FINAL Reading. 


The Housing Trust Fund Monitoring Ordinance, sponsored by Supervisor Chiu was heard next. 
This Commission approved this item with modifications two weeks ago. Supervisor Chiu adopted all of the Commission modifications. Mayor’s Office of Housing proposed another modification asking that the monitoring reports also evaluate programs that provide assistance to household earning 120% or more of AMI to capture a HTF program that provides assistance to this income category.  
The Board approved the Ordinance with Planning Commission and Mayor’s office of Housing’s modifications on FINAL reading.
 


Next up was an Ordinance that grew out of Supervisor Chiu’s NE Legislation.  This part is now titled “Limited Commercial uses in RTO-Mission”. This Ordinance would expand the allowable floor area for Limited Corner Commercial Uses, or LCCUs, from 1200 sq. ft. to 2500 sq. ft. and to allow them within 100’ of a corner instead of 50’ from a corner within RTO-M Districts.  The Board already voted to expand this provision in the RM-3 and RM-4 Districts, and that change has been made in the Planning Code, however there was a desire by one of the cosponsor of the legislation, Supervisor Campos, to expand the provision to include Mission RTO District.  
This week the Ordinance was passed on FINAL reading.
 


120816 Admin Code: Port Pre-Payment of Jobs-Housing Linkage
. This is a proposed Ordinance that would amend the Administrative Code to encourage the development of affordable housing on Port properties.  Sponsored by Supervisor Kim.  The Planning Commission did not hold a hearing on this item, but instead requested an informational memo.  This would allow the Port & MOH to enter an MOU.  This agreement would enable the Port would receive credits towards the Jobs-Housing Linkage Fee in exchange for use of port property for affordable housing.  
This week the item past on first reading.

BOARD OF APPEALS


The Board heard two items that may be of interest to the Planning Commission. 


The first was an appeal of a Zoning Administrator Letter of Determination for 1101-1101 Dolores Street that found the subject lot was a legal, non-conforming lot for the purposes of the Planning Code.  This Letter of Determination was upheld by the Board of Appeals.


 


The second was an appeal of a Zoning Administrator Letter of Determination for 498 Hoffman Avenue that found the subject building legally contained two dwelling units based upon past building permits and a notice of special restriction.  This Letter of Determination was upheld by the Board of Appeals.
