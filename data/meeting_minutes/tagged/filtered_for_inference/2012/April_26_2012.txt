The CPMC LRDP includes Near-Term and Long-Term Projects.  The Near-Term Projects include the following:  (1) Cathedral Hill Campus would include: (a) demolition of the existing on-site vacant Cathedral Hill Hotel and 1255 Post Street office building and development of a new 15-story, 555-bed hospital with 513 underground parking spaces; (b) demolition of seven existing, on-site vacant residential and commercial buildings and construction of a new medical office building (the Cathedral Hill MOB) with 542 underground parking spaces; (c) an underground   pedestrian  tunnel beneath  Van  Ness  Avenue connecting  the new Cathedral Hill MOB and new hospital; (d) conversion of the 1375 Sutter Street office building to exclusively MOB use, (e) conversion of Cedar Street to two-way operation west of the Cathedral Hill MOB garage access; and (f) various streetscape, sidewalk, and landscape improvements; and (g) other implementation activities regarding the transfer of existing medical uses to the Cathedral Hill Campus; (2) St. Luke’s Campus  would include: (a) street vacation of a portion of San Jose Avenue between Cesar Chavez and 27th Streets and construction of a new five-story, 80-bed replacement hospital, (b) demolition of the existing on-site St. Luke's hospital tower and  construction of a five-story MOB/Expansion Building with approximately 220 underground parking spaces on  the  site  of  the  former  (demolished)  hospital, and (c) various streetscape improvements such as a new entry plaza, courtyard, and pedestrian pathway; and (3) Davies Campus would include construction of a new, four-story Neuroscience Institute building on a portion of the Davies Campus at the corner of Noe Street and Duboce Avenue.


            The Long-Term Projects at the Davies Campus would include demolition of the existing parking garage at 14th and Castro Streets and construction of a three-story MOB.  The Long-Term Projects at the Pacific Campus would include construction of a new underground parking garage, a new, nine-story Ambulatory Care Center (ACC) Addition and construction of a new, six-story (plus top deck) parking garage, and demolition of certain existing on-site buildings to facilitate the proposed construction.  There are no Near-Term or Long-Term Projects proposed for the California Campus.  


            The  proposed  new  Cathedral  Hill  Hospital  Campus  is  within  the RC-4 (Residential  Commercial-High  Density)  Use  District,  NC-3 (Neighborhood Commercial, Moderate-Scale) Use District, and Van Ness Special Use District (SUD);  and  130-V and 130-E Height and Bulk Districts.  The Pacific Campus is within the RM-1 and RM-2 (Low Density Residential, Mixed and Moderate Density Residential, Mixed, respectively) Use Districts; and 40-X and 160-F Height and Bulk Districts.  The California Campus is within the RM-2 and RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) Use District; and the 80-E and 40-X Height and Bulk Districts. The Davies Campus is within the RH-3 (Residential, House, Three-Family) Use District; and the 65-D and 130-E Height and Bulk Districts. The St. Luke’s Campus is within the RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) Use District; and 65-A and 105-E Height and Bulk Districts.  The Final EIR concluded that implementation of the CPMC LRDP would result in significant unavoidable environmental impacts related to Transportation; Air Quality; Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions; and Noise.


            Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the Final Environmental Impact Report.
