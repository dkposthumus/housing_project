Commissioner Antonini
:


I want to thank Commissioner Wu for requesting that we get zoning maps for her first meeting. 

It has been very helpful and I have enough wall space in my office to actually put it up.

I have talked to Secretary Avery and she has talked to Director Rahaim about

us having a hearing in the future where we could have a discussion about the zoning categories for the benefit of the commissioners and for the public. I think there are questions that would come up and it would make it easier for people to understand what is going on when we are discussing the differences of what is an NCD and what is an NCT; and there are also a lot of special use districts. I think it would be helpful during one of our sessions to go over that. I would suggest calendaring it and I would like to see if we have agreement from the other commissioners along those lines. I do not need an answer right now. The other two things I want to suggest are a couple of extremely good books that I became aware of and am reading this week. The first one was mentioned in the book section of the Chronicle. It is the Future of the American City by Alan Ehrenhalt. Basically it deals with something that we see a lot of, that is, urban areas are a lot more desirable than they were 20 or 30 years ago when people were trying to get as far away from urban areas as they could. This is not just a phenomenon in San Francisco or in the United States, but is worldwide, and it has been happening for the last 200 or 300 years in the world as opposed to the last 50 years or so when suburbanization began. I've only finished about 1/3 of it, but he makes some really good points and it is very good reading.  The other one is "In the Sand."  The author Laurie Ungariedi has written about the story of the Sunset District from about 1850 through 1955 and how that area  was reclaimed and the people involved in settling the area and the housing and the builders, and a lot of transit stories. It is an extremely good book to read. It talks about the history of a significant portion of San Francisco.


Commissioner Miguel:


I have finished "The Future of the American City”. I disagree a little bit with Alan Ehrenhalt's first book. I personally I do not think it is very well written, although it has a lot of information in it.  He takes a long time to say something.  Its concentration is in the United Sates mainly from Chicago east.  It is interesting that the San Jose City Council just passed a resolution that affects high rise residential tower development in downtown in order to increase the number of businesses.  They are trying to guarantee an application review of 120 days; they are doing a 50% reduction in fees; and 50% reduction in construction related taxes.  There are a bunch more stuff and I have not read all of the details or all of the legislations on it.  But it sort of falls within the same category of movement from suburbia to downtown in effect, and that has been happening in San Francisco for some time now.  From what I read in Alan Ehrenhalt’s book, we are probably a bit ahead of the curve.  He entirely missed the West Coast.


Commissioner Sugaya:


Director Rahaim mentioned that there was an interesting internet site where they discuss a lots of urban issues, but there was an interesting short comment from a person who was saying that [they] took another look at high rise development and are making the argument that in the future, with energy shortages, high rises will in essence be unlivable and argues for a more medium density approach.  


Since we are talking about books, “The Season of the Witch”, which just came out.  It is about the history of the City of San Francisco government and politics from the late 60s thru the 80s. 


Also, on May 4th there was an article regarding the Academy of Art University luncheon honoring etc., etc., and speeches were made and Ed Lee stopped by and proclaimed our university "a beautiful institution" that has "done so much to fill so many vacancies in our City."  Is the Mayor on board with this Commission is my question. We know that the Academy of Art has had multiple numbers of violations, not only in the Planning Code, but also Building Code violations, DPW code violations, and sidewalk encroachment violations. Some of those have been corrected over the years, however, there is still an outstanding member of Conditional Use violations that this Commission has not taken up, because there is supposedly an Environmental Impact Review ongoing because of the Master Plan, but they keep buying additional properties, which continues to delay the process and the ability of this Commission to take up the issues. I think this quote flies in the face of the Commission's ability to do its work, and I think we should send him a note. 


Commissioner Antonini
:


Just in regard to Commissioner Sugaya's comments, you have to bear in mind that what is in newspapers is often taken out of context and we may not always agree on things.

D.         DIRECTOR’S REPORT


 


5.
                   
Director’s Announcements


 


            
Director Rahaim:


There was nothing at the Land Use Committee this week. The Board of Supervisors did have a lengthy meeting to make up for it. They had final readings on a couple of ordinances that you previously considered. The first was an ordinance from Supervisor Mar that will allow a 5-foot Increase for certain active uses is in the Richmond District. You heard this ordinance on February 6th and your recommendations were incorporated into the ordinance that did pass this week. Similarly, Articles 10 and 11 now sponsored by Supervisors Wiener and Olague passed on final reading at the Board of Supervisors. This now puts the Historic Preservation Commission into the Planning Code. It has now been adopted by the Board of Supervisors. 


There was an appeal for the conditional use authorization for 8 Washington, as well as a CEQA appeal for this project. This is a proposal to demolish the existing Gateway Club and put in a new health club and residential buildings, two to 12 stories with about 134 dwelling units.  These two appeals were combined to save time. Nonetheless, the hearing ran past 12:30 a.m. and the primary concerns vary from the lack of recreational facilities and parking impacts to financial considerations, such as what are the public benefits, including those for affordable housing and whether they are sufficient. Urban design and flow on the Waterfront were also questioned. The district Supervisor and Board President Chiu led the questioning. The supervisors felt the PUC and CU were being authorized and he felt that this was reflecting a high increase that had not been addressed. This was due in part to the timing of the appeals. Whereas this Commission typically considers things first required by law, then the policy document and the General Plan, and then on to the Zoning Map and finally, entitlements. At the last hearing, this was different for the Board because of the appeal. The only considered CEQA first and then entitlements. The height reclassification will return to the Board in June, as will the Development Agreement and on Tuesday, after most of the discussion, the first discussion by President Chiu was to table the EIR. The EIR was then certified 8-3., Next there was a motion to consider a continuation hearing. The last was an authorization of the CU vote and it did pass; then there was the Administrative Code to add limitations on eligibility, application deadlines, to add a timeline for the receipt of the report and to make various changes. This will be scheduled for you in the near term. 


There were a couple of ordinances that were introduced and that we have been working with the Mayor and staff on. The first is the transportation Sustainability Fee. I believe the Director has provided you with a great deal regarding that; and the second was the Impact Fee and the development updates.

Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board 
of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.


 




Board of Supervisors:




LAND USE COMMITTEE: no planning / land use items


FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: No Planning / Land Use Items




111247 Ordinance to allow a 5’ Ground Floor Increase in the NC-3 District along Geary.  
Commissioners, you considered this Ordinance on February 6
th
 of this year.  At that time you recommended approval of Supervisor Mar’s Ordinance with modifications.  Your recommended modifications were incorporated into the Ordinance last week including 




adding the 5’ bonus to 




Inner Clement Neighborhood Commercial District
[1]
; 


the Outer Clement Neighborhood Commercial District 
[2]
; and
 


certain NC-2  District parcels on Balboa Street
[3]
.  






Exempting certain parcels on the north side of Geary Blvd. The Commission also recommended pulling back the bonus on Geary so that it would begin west of Masonic Avenue.
 


The Supervisor had also amended the Ordinance to apply lot merger limitations to the Clement and Balboa Street corridors. 








This week the Board approved the Ordinance on FINAL reading.


 




120300 and 120301 Articles 10 & 11.  
(PC provided review and comment on 2/2/12,  HPC review and comment on 2/1/12, Land Use 5/1/12)  After a few questions to staff, the full board passed on final reading the proposed amendments to Articles 10 and 11 introduced by Supervisor Scott Wiener and co-sponsored by Supervisor Olague.  


8 Washington CU and CEQA Appeal.  
The proposal is to demolish the existing Golden Gateway Swim and Tennis Club and the existing surface parking lot on Seawall 351, and construct a new health club, residential buildings ranging from four to twelve stores in height containing 134 dwelling units, ground-floor retail uses totaling approximately 20,000 square feet, and 382 off-street parking spaces.  The two appeals were combined to save time, nonethess the hearing ran past 12:30am.  The primary concerns varied from the loss of rec facilities and parking and traffic impacts; to financial considerations such as are the public benefits, including affordable housing sufficient?  Urban design and the appropriate heights along the waterfront were also questioned.  District Supervisor and Board President Chiu led the initial questioning.  He explored all facets of the proposal and questioned the timing of the items before the Board.  The Supervisor felt that the PUD & CU being authorized were effectively being granted a height increase that had not yet been approved.  This is due, at least in part, to the timing of the appeals.  Whereas, this Commission typically considers  CEQA first (as required) followed by any amendments to City Policy in the General Plan, then amendments to the Zoning Map/PC, and last considers approvals; at Tuesday’s hearing the Board considered only CEQA and then the entitlements in the CU.  The height reclassification will return to the Board in June as will the Development Agreement and associated actions. 
 After much discussion, the first motion by Chu was to table the EIR—this failed by an 3-8 vote.  The EIR was then certified by a 8-3 vote.  Next, there was a motion by Chu to continue the CU hearing this failed by a 4-7 vote (Avalos, Chiu, Cohen, Wiener).  The last vote of the night was to authorize the CU, this passed 8-3.
 




INTRODUCTIONS:  




Mills Act120528.   Wiener.  
Ordinance amending the San Francisco Administrative Code, Chapter 71, entitled "Mills Act Contract Procedures" to amend Section 71.2 to add limitations on eligibility, amend Section 71.3 to add application deadlines, amend Section 71.4 to add a time limit for receipt of the Assessor-Recorder's report, amend Section 71.5 to require use of a standard form contract, and adding new Section 71.7 to require departmental monitoring reports; amending the San Francisco Planning Code by amending Section 356 to reduce the application fee for Mills Act contracts.
 


120524 Transportation Sustainability Fee.  Mayor, Scott Wiener, Christina Olague. 
Ordinance amending the San Francisco Planning Code by: 1) adding new Sections 411A through 411A.11 to establish a new citywide Transportation Sustainability Fee and 2) amending Section 401 to add definitions reflecting these changes.
 


120523 Transit Impact Development Fee Increase and Updates.  Mayor, Scott Wiener, Christina Olague.

BOARD OF APPEALS:


The Board of Appeals did meet last night. One item before the commission was an appeal of the wireless permit for 156 27
th
 Avenue; it is in the public right-of-way in front of that property. It is a permit issued by the Department of Public Works and is in the public right of way. We do review those, in this case, because of what is on a good view street. We found that it was compatible and the Board of Appeals disagreed with that and actually denied the permit. They denied the wireless permit for that location. Also, last night was President Garcia's last hearing. He has been on the Board of Appeals for seven years and prior to that, the Ethics Commission for two years. He has been serving since I have been going to the Board of Appeals. He has been a consistent presence along with Commissioner Fong. I found him to be very prepared and fastidious and funny as well. It has been a privilege to have him as a commissioner on the Board of Appeals. We wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors. 


 


HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:


On May 16th, a Certificate of Appropriateness to changes at the location that is part of the housing at Laguna appeared along with the project sponsors. Supervisor Wiener spoke in support of the project. The Commission voted unanimously to approve. Also at this hearing, the Commission considered extending the delegation of Minor permits to Alter to Department staff for Administrative review and action. This delegation of authority to the Department has lowered the cost and helped streamline projects that otherwise require a public hearing before HPC. At the conclusion of the hearing, they directed staff to further provide information on how to improve the review process and further help reduce cost and time for project applicants. We intend to provide more information in early July. Unless you have questions, that concludes my report.

Hearing on the 835-845 Jackson Street - Chinese Hospital Replacement Project
 
Draft EIR
 - 
The proposed project is located at 835-845 Jackson Street [Assessor’s Block/Lot 192/41]. The Chinese Hospital property, located in the Chinatown neighborhood at Jackson Street between Stockton and Powell Streets, consists of the approximately 43,368-gross-square-foot (gsf), 54-bed Chinese Hospital at 845 Jackson Street, built in 1979; the approximately 29,793-gsf Medical Administration Building (MAB) at 835 Jackson Street (the original Chinese Hospital, built in 1924); and the approximately 15,000-gsf Chinese Hospital Parking Garage, located directly behind the 1924 MAB.  These three buildings constitute the project site, an approximately 22,516-square-foot lot.  The Chinese Hospital Association is the project sponsor for this project.  The proposed project includes: 1) demolition of the 1924 MAB and the 41-space Chinese Hospital Parking Garage on the project site; 2) construction of a 54-bed, acute-care, 101,545-gsf, seven-story-plus-basement, 90.5-foot-tall (excluding 30-foot-tall mechanical penthouse above the roof) Replacement Hospital building with a new 22-bed skilled nursing facility on the sites of the demolished buildings on the eastern portion of the project site (an approximately 11, 526-square-foot area); 3) renovation of the existing on-site 1979 Chinese Hospital building at 845 Jackson Street to serve as a Medical Administration and Outpatient Center (MAOC); and 4) a proposal to create a Special Use District (SUD) for the proposed project to support the expansion of medical services on the project site (835-845 Jackson Street, APN 192/41) in the Chinatown Residential Neighborhood Commercial Zoning District.  The proposed Replacement Hospital building would be designed and constructed to fully comply with the requirements of Senate Bill 1953 for seismic safety of acute-care facilities.  The existing 1979 Chinese Hospital would remain in operation until the proposed Replacement Hospital is fully functional. The proposed project would be completed in two development phases over a four-year period between fall 2012 and winter 2015.  In addition to the proposed project, two variants are being considered by the project sponsor:  (1) The Off-Street Parking Variant would include the same development on the 835-845 Jackson Street project site as the proposed project; in addition, it would include off-street parking and an expanded engineering shop and storage space for Chinese Hospital at the existing Powell Street Parking Garage at 1140 Powell Street (APN 192/14).  The Powell Street Parking Garage is located on Powell Street between Washington and Jackson Streets to the west of the project site. Under the Off-Street Parking Variant (i.e. garage variant), Chinese Hospital Association (the project sponsor) may either purchase the Powell Street Parking Garage or lease space in the garage on a long-term basis; and (2) The Hospital Façade Design Variant would have a different design for the Replacement Hospital’s façade, compared to the proposed project; this variant would otherwise be identical in terms of development and building envelope to the proposed project.  The project site is in the Chinatown Residential and Neighborhood Commercial (CRNC) Zoning District and a 65-N Height and Bulk District. The proposed project would require General Plan referral, General Plan amendments, Planning Code text and Zoning Map amendments to reclassify height and bulk limits and establish SUD boundaries, among other project approvals.  The Draft EIR  concluded that implementation of the proposed project and its two variants would result in the following project-level and cumulative significant unavoidable environmental impacts: (1) Demolition of the original 1924 Chinese Hospital Building at 835 Jackson Street (i.e. 1924 MAB) under the proposed project would result in significant and unavoidable historic architectural resources impacts on an individual historic resource (the 1924 MAB) and on the NRHP/CRHR-eligible Chinatown historic district, both of which were identified as historic resources under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA); (2) Construction (i.e. design and development) of the proposed Replacement Hospital on the project site would result in a significant unavoidable historic architectural resources impact on the NRHP/CRHR-eligible Chinatown historic district; (3) Demolition of the 1924 MAB and construction of the Replacement Hospital under the proposed project would also result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to significant adverse impacts on the NRHP/CRHR-eligible Chinatown historic district; and (4) Construction of the proposed project would generate substantial levels of particulate matter or PM
2.5  
and other toxic air contaminants (TACs), including diesel particulate matter (DPM), that could substantially affect sensitive receptors and this would be a significant and unavoidable air quality-related health risk impact.
  


Preliminary Recommendation: No action is required. This hearing is for the purpose of receiving Planning Commission and public comment only.

PUBLIC COMMENT


 


At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes. 


 


The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public comment, the commission is limited to: 


 


(1)  responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or


(2)  requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or 


(3)
     
directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.  (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))
