Transit Center District Plan and Transit Tower
 
- blocks generally bounded by Market, Steuart, and Folsom Streets, and a line east of Third Street. 
 Certification of Final Environmental Impact Report. 
 The Transit Center District Plan proposes new policies and controls for land use; building height and design; street network; historic preservation; and sustainability. The Plan would permit approximately six buildings with heights ranging from 700-1,000 feet.  Associated Planning Code and Zoning Map amendments to implement the Plan are also proposed.  The EIR analyzes at a project level the Transit Tower, a proposed 61-story, 1,070-foot-tall (including sculptural element) building with about 1.3 million square feet (sf) of office space, about 16,500 sf of retail, and subgrade loading and parking for about 300 vehicles (480 valet spaces). The Transit Tower project site is located at 425 Mission Street (a.k.a. 101 First Street) (Block 3720, Lot 009 (formerly Lot 001)), on the south side of Mission Street between First and Fremont Streets, immediately north of the new Transit Center currently under construction.


NOTE: The public hearing on the Draft EIR is closed. The public comment period for the Draft EIR ended on November 28, 2012. The Planning Commission does not conduct public review of Final EIRs. Public comments on the certification may be presented to the Planning Commission during the category for

TRANSIT CENTER DISTRICT PLAN – 
Adoption Actions
 
- The Planning Department is seeking to adopt and implement the Transit Center District Plan (“the Plan”). The result of a multi-year public and cooperative interagency planning process that began in 2007, the Plan is a comprehensive vision for shaping growth on the southern side of the Downtown to respond to and support the construction of the new Transbay Transit Center project, including the Downtown Rail Extension. In addition to laying out policy recommendations to accommodate additional transit-oriented growth, sculpt the downtown skyline, improve streets and open spaces, and expand protection of historic resources, the Plan would result in the potential to generate over $575 million for public infrastructure, particularly the Downtown Rail Extension project. The planning process was initiated in 2007. Public workshops were held throughout 2007-2009 and a Draft Plan for Public Review was published in November 2009. In April 2012 the Planning Department published a Draft Plan Addendum. Adoption of the Plan will consist of the following actions below.

Commissioner Moore:


I had the opportunity to watch the 34
th
 Americas Cup in Venice, Italy.  it was one of the most spectacular things I have ever seen, I will be happy to share some pictures. Also, I’d like to talk to you about some lessons I learned around the issue of crowd control.  It was a remarkable event.  The only unusual thing was that there was an earthquake – it was kind of surprising.


Commissioner Antonini


Very happy to be part of the ceremony announcing the Warriors are trying to find a new arena. I have been talking about a concept of a new arena probably at every meeting - not just for basketball but for uses we loose to other locals because we do not have the proper arena space in San Francisco.  We could begin to have many concerts, conventions and other sporting events.  It would be a great economic boon if it is able to go forward and I hope it is.  Early on I spoke on the report regarding company headquarters that we have in San Francisco.  Fortune Magazine highlighted Charlotte as a city that it is on the move and does have a number of headquarters.  An opinion was expressed that it was a major banking center. Charlotte is hosting the Democratic National Convention this year.  Conventions could occur in SF, but after the problems we had with logistics with the Moscone Center in 1984 – unless or until there is an arena like the one being proposed to be built, we won’t be hosting a national political convention.

LAND USE COMMITTEE: 




120047 Including Financial Services Within Definition of Formula Retail.
 
At this week’s Land Use Committee hearing, the Committee heard Supervisor Mar’s proposal to include Financial Services in the definition of Formula Retail.  This Commission recommended approval w/o modification of this Ordinance on April 12, 2012
[1]
.  Supervisor Wiener introduced two amendments to the legislation.  The first one would make the formula retail controls for Financial Services apply only to business located on the ground floor and the second amendment would grandfather projects that had already been submitted at the time the ordinance was introduced, which was January 24, 2012.  The first amendment failed by a 2 to 1 vote and the second amendment passed with a unanimous vote.  The Committee voted 3-0 to recommend approval of the proposed legislation to the Board of Supervisors.   The Ordinance will be heard at the June 5th Board hearing.
