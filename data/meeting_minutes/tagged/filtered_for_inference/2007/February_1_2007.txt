Informational presentation on the Transbay Terminal Project and the Department's program for planning and developing zoning and other implementation programs for the Transbay Terminal District


 


SPEAKERS


Jim Haas




Emphasized that this study is to extract more money for the Caltrain station.


A year ago the plan was to build a bus terminal with the intention to extend the train station as well.


The City could do more to bring the train to the downtown.


The terminal tower should be the tallest to get people's attention.


Expressed concern about potential disconnection of the Planning Department and the Transbay Authority.




Bernie Chodin




This is an exciting project.


Suggested that the land not be sold but instead sell the development rights.


It would create revenue and sustainable funds for affordable housing.




Stewart Bloom




The power point presentation was very helpful.


San Francisco is what people read about and enjoy.


Do not loose the romance [of San Francisco] to experience what is popular.




Sue Hestor




Questioned who the proposal is for -- residents of the city or spectators.


This has implication for the entire city. There is no real world perspective.


We would not be able to see the city and Bay Bridge.


There are different climates in the city and sunlight would be obstructed.




Maryann Miller




Urge [the city] to have a plan first and then invite developers to join in.


San Franciscans look at this city in a different way than architects.


Developers just want popularity from constructing high-rise buildings in San Francisco.




 


This was an informational hearing only and no Action was required of the Commission.
