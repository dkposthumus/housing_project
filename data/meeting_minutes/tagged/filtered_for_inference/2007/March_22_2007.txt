 There are concerns with this project.




We need more time to address those concerns.




Nick Pagoulatos

 Supports the continuance.




Analysis from the Planning Department is inadequate [parking would negatively impact].


It should wait for the Mission District's final rezoning proposal to take place.


Department should analyze how market-rate projects likes this one are affecting affordable housing in the Mission.

 This is a very good document to consider when considering what to build.


Commissioner Sugaya


-
 
 At the Recreation and Park Department hearing last week we considered a [relatively] small park for Guy Place.


-
 
 It has an amount for a design fee.

SPEAKERS


Patricia Vaughey


-
 
 Case at 2026 Lombard Avenue is at the Board of Appeals and still pending a decision.


-
 
 The Board requested a modified plan.
 
 The main issue was a lot of water under the building.


-
 
 Interesting fact that in order to drain the water, it needed to pin both sides of the building for safety reasons - [during an earthquake the building would slant].


-
 
 A case about a nail place was overturned at the Board of Appeals.


-
 
 There were many existing within the same block.


-
 
 We should have rules in the Planning Code to seek diversity of business and services in a neighborhood.


Sue Hestor


-
 
 Concerned about the Urban Design Guideline Neighborhood Commercial Area.


-
 
 Guidelines do not deal with the complexity of residential low-income rental.


-
 
 It has happened in the Mission District where a residential building has a narrow yard on the ground floor.


-
 
 It is inadequate to increase density and not change commercial guidelines. This is happening in the Market and Octavia Plan.

CONTROLS FOR LOSS OF DWELLING UNITS
 
- 
a proposed ordinance amending the
 
 Planning Code,
 adding Section 317, requiring a Planning Commission hearing for any project that would eliminate existing legal dwelling and live-work units through mergers, conversions, or demolitions, and making environmental findings and findings of consistency with the priority policies of Planning Code Section 101.1 and the General Plan
.
 On November 2, 2006, the Commission adopted Resolution No. 17334, an intent to initiate a Planning Code amendment stipulating mandatory discretionary review of or Conditional Use for all residential merger, conversion, demolition and replacement building permit applications.


(Continued indefinitely on January 11, 2007, and re-advertised for this date)


Preliminary Recommendation: Adopt Resolution recommending adoption of the proposed amendment.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of March 15, 2007)


 


SPEAKERS


Nancy Wuerfel
, Sunset Park Side Education and Action Committee


-
 
 Totally support the proposed regulations.




Extremely significant to recognize how important affordable housing is in the city.


This ordinance would facilitate the work of everybody.




Greg Gladstone




Concerned about affecting projects that have not received full building permits.


Projects take a long time in the process before getting it.


Grandfather dates should be for those needing Environmental Review for applications for alteration permits.


It is important to have public hearings when adopting this legislation.




McCarthy


-
 
 The demolition policy currently in place solves the problem.


-
 
 Page 7 of this proposed ordinance is not clear on how quantifying percentage.


-
 
 This ordinance is happening to fast and it is not clear.
 
 It needs transparency.


Alice


-
 
 This item should be continued.


-
 
 There are three different versions of this legislation.


-
 
 There are a lot of details on the implementation of this ordinance.


-
 
 Page 7 is not clear.
 
 This legislation needs more time to debate.


Janine New


-
 
 This is not going to solve the problems of demolition.


-
 
 It is going to affect families and buildings that need rehabilitation.


-
 
 You have the power to make decisions on individual cases.


-
 
 The proposed legislation is too broad.


Shawn


-
 
 Last year there were only 40 demolitions in the city.




It is a good number for ongoing stock renovation.




-
 
 Deadline should be May 31.


Mr. Boskovich


-
 
 Staff is very effective on recognizing when demolition is needed.


-
 
 They need some power in decision making so as to not have every single case come to the Commission.


-
 
 Define what defacto demolition is on page 7 [b and c].


Bryan McGee


-
 
 The legislation is confusing.




Staff said they would clarify it.


Public should be able to review before approving it and have a dialogue.




Richard Hart


-
 
 This needs a separate hearing.
 
 We do want to keep affordable units.




This legislation needs clarification on page 7 [b and c].




 


Grace Shanon


-
 
 Ordinance is confusing.


-
 
 Requested more clarity [wording] of these guidelines.


Raid




Existent control should have been reviewed before writing this legislation.


Costs and permits on this ordinance are hypothetical.




-
 
 It needs more clarity.


Kevin


-
 
 Requested continuance to include more clarity on this legislation.


-
 
 I am a homeowner trying to renovate my house and no constructor wants to start because it is confusing.


Henry


-
 
 We need to define what demolition is first.


-
 
 Continued to have more clarity and look at it closely.


John


-
 
 Two cases not being schedule for hearing because of this legislation.


-
 
 Requested the Commission and Administrator to make decision on cases that are in the process.


Leo


-
 
 Requested explanation of Page 7 lines 10 to 15 and page 11 line 15.


-
 
 Words are so confusing and open to interpretation.


-
 
 Consider grandfather dates and projects on pipeline to be included on this legislation.


John O'Connell


-
 
 This legislation [document] needs a separate hearing itself to explain it and rework it


David


-
 
 I do not understand why you are taking this legislation into consideration.


-
 
 Current guidelines automatically restrict dwelling unit demolitions under discretionary review.


Tyrike Laris


-
 
 I have a project and everything is ready for the demolition but it is on hold because of this legislation.


-
 
 Commission and staff have done a great job with the current guidelines.


Silvan




There are currently defined guidelines that are effective.




Jim Keith




The Commission and staff have done an incredible job on demolitions.


There is no need for changing these guidelines.


We need clarity therefore it should be continued.




Joe


-
 
 This kind of legislation needs to have builders input.
 
 It does not make any sense.


-
 
 This is just pure politics.
 
 The Commission has done a wonderful job.


-
 
 We heard 40 demolitions for the past year and I would like to know the number of housing replacements for those demolitions.


Patricia Vaughey


-
 
 This is good legislation that needs some refinement.




We need to look what is best for the entire city.


Demolitions that happened in the last year were replaced for single occupancy units and not for families.


Affordable housing is being built that is not really affordable for San Franciscans.




John Curlie




Legislation is not clear


Homeowners are going to be affected by it.


This process would stop demolition of buildings that would put at risk safety of properties and public.

SPEAKERS


Jim Ruben
, Grand Hyatt/Project Sponsor Representative




This is a relatively modest proposal to fix a space that has not worked very well over the years.


In working with staff, we have come up with a program that would activate that area.


It will enliven the ground floor experience at the Hotel inside the lobby and outside in the courtyard area.




Tom


-
 
 We have tried to improve pedestrian traffic.




New design would encourage gathering around the fountain.




-
 
 Restaurant at the lobby of the hotel with small planters would provide a cohesive area.


Sue Hestor


-
 
 This plaza is a public space and now is going to incorporate restaurants.




When the Hotel was built, it was offered to have an observation deck and it is not there.


Compensation is very low; formula for the calculations should be revised.

Institutional Master Plan (IMP) for the San Francisco General Hospital Medical Center (SFGHMC)
.
 
 Since 1987, there have been several developments on the SFGHMC campus including but not limited to construction of two new floors for the Statewide AIDS Research Laboratory on the Pathology Building in 1990, construction of the 98,000 square-foot San Francisco Behavior Health Facility on the northern end of the campus in 1992, and the construction of the 5,500 square-foot Avon Comprehensive Breast Care Center adjacent of 22nd Street in 2004.
 
 More recently, SFGHMC proposes to construct and operate a medical helipad on the rooftop of the existing Main Hospital building and to build a new acute care hospital in compliance with California Senate Bill (SB) 1953 on the campus.
 
 SB 1953 mandates that all acute care building meet established seismic standards by 2013.
 
 A full IMP that reflects the proposed new acute care hospital development and its impacts will be prepared in the near future and be submitted separately from this update.

SPEAKERS


Bridget Maley, President of Landmarks Board




We reviewed the Environmental Impact Report in December.


A letter was submitted in January 2005 recommending that the Historic Survey should be included in the Review.


We still have concerns about it and are present today to reinforce them.




-
 
 The survey would help understand the impact to the areas in terms of historic resources.


Mrs. Bland Platt


-
 
 Encouraged the Commission not to adopt the EIR until the Historic Survey is done.


-
 
 The initial forms are done and the survey should be ready by June of this year.


-
 
 Transfer Development Rights should not go forward. It has been $20 a square foot and for Market and Octavia it would be $15.


Mary Miles, Coalition for adequate review


-
 
 You should not adopt the certification until the Historic Survey is done.


-
 
 Re-circulate the Report.
 
 You do not have the proper data for this large project.




Conclusive material on transit and transportation is not supported by the data.
 
 It would not survive a court challenge.




-
 
 Parking is an impact under CEQA requirements.


Marilyn Amini


-
 
 The Final Environmental Impact Review is not adequate.


-
 
 Cumulative impacts must be considered.


-
 
 Creating three substantial zoning classifications that can be applied to other parts of the city have not been evaluated.


-
 
 The public has not been adequately notified about the impact of this project.


-
 
 Long-term plan elements are not analyzed and addressed in the Report.


Hiroshi Fukuda


-
 
 The public has to be informed about the intent of high density on the transit corridor.




When the draft EIR was presented in 2005, it did not include [an analysis of] driving impacts on transit on Van Ness Avenue.


We need diverse housing for this plan.


The majority is going to be market-rate.
 
 We need housing for very low incomes.




Jason Henderson, Hayes Valley Neighborhood Association


-
 
 Urged the Commission to approve the report.


-
 
 I am comfortable and confident that the historic survey will be done in a timely manner.


-
 
 Suggested that the transportation component be re-visited.


Michael Wilson, Board of Directors for the Merchants of Upper Castro and Market


-
 
 We support the one-to-one ratio parking as the best interest for the neighborhood.


-
 
 The proposed reduced parking will negatively impact the current parking deficit.


Cynthia Servetnick, Co-Chair, Save the UC Berkeley Laguna Street Campus




The Laguna Campus is the largest area within the Market and Octavia Plan.


The Plan fails to analyze the potential loss of this historical resource with the proposed zoning.


It could be done with the proposed project for 55 Laguna Street.




Tom Radulovich, San Franciscan's for a Livable City


-
 
 I'm in support of approving the Environmental Impact Report.


-
 
 San Franciscan's for a Livable City and the Coalition sent a letter requesting that you open up Haight Street for two-way traffic.


-
 
 It could be done by having a finding of overriding consideration for that street in this report.


Sue Hestor




Requested that the Commission ask the Redevelopment Agency whether the lack of certification of this process delays the implementation of redeveloping parcels.


I have issues with sun, view and climate quality.


There are a lot of projects proposed for downtown.


We do not have cumulative analysis on wind and shadow for this area.

Market & Octavia Neighborhood Plan
 
 - 
Certification of Final Environmental Impact Report -
 The project area lies to the west of the City's downtown financial district and sits at the junction of several neighborhoods, including, Civic Center, Hayes Valley, Western Addition, South of Market, Inner Mission, the Castro, Duboce Triangle, Eureka Valley, and Upper Market.
 
 The proposed neighborhood plan would reclassify the existing zoning from Residential Districts (R), Neighborhood Commercial Districts (NCD's), Moderate-Scale Neighborhood Commercial (NC-3), and Heavy Commercial (C-M) to Downtown General Commercial Districts (C-3-G), Residential Transit Oriented (RTO), Neighborhood Commercial Transit Districts (NCT), Neighborhood Commercial-Transit, and Moderate-Scale Mixed Use Districts (NCT-3). It would also increase height limits in certain areas and reduce height limits in other areas.
 
 The proposed zoning and height reclassifications would increase the potential for residential development in the area.


Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the Final Environmental Impact Report.
 


Please note: The public review period for the Draft Environmental Impact Report is closed.
 
 The Planning Commission does not conduct public review of Final EIRs. Public comments on the certification may be presented to the Planning Commission during the Public Comment portion of the Commission calendar

Market & Octavia Neighborhood Plan
 
 
-
 
Adoption of CEQA Findings Related to EIR and Potential Project Approval Action
 
- The project includes proposed amendments to the General Plan, Planning Code and Zoning Map.
 
 The project area lies to the west of the City's downtown financial district and sits at the junction of several neighborhoods, including, Civic Center, Hayes Valley, Western Addition, South of Market, Inner Mission, the Castro, Duboce Triangle, Eureka Valley, and Upper Market.
 
 The proposed neighborhood plan would:
 
 
(1) amend the General Plan, adding a new Area Plan (the Market and Octavia Area Plan) and make related amendments to the Commerce and Industry, Housing, Recreation and Open Space and Transportation Elements, the Civic Center Area Plan, Downtown Area Plan, South of Market Area Plan and the Land Use Index; and (2)
 
amend the Planning Code and Zoning Map to reclassify the existing zoning from Residential Districts (R), Neighborhood Commercial Districts (NCD's), Moderate-Scale Neighborhood Commercial (NC-3), and Heavy Commercial (C-M) to Downtown General Commercial Districts (C-3-G), Residential Transit Oriented (RTO), Neighborhood Commercial Transit Districts (NCT), Neighborhood Commercial-Transit, Moderate-Scale Mixed Use Districts (NCT-3). The project would also increase height limits in certain areas and reduce height limits in other areas, and establish new fees.
 
 The proposed zoning and height reclassifications would increase the potential for residential development in the area.
 


Preliminary Recommendation: Adopt CEQA Findings.

SPEAKERS


Joe Curtin, Castro Area Planning and Action


-
 
 I'm in support of the amendments to the plan.


-
 
 It is important to include the historic preservation survey and protection should be implemented.


Demian Quesnel
 
Eureka Valley Planning Association


-
 
 Concerned about parking in the Eureka Valley Area.


-
 
 Homeowners are more likely to own a car than home renters.




The center area of the plan would have homeownership and our neighborhood would be negatively impacted.




 


Dennis Richards, Duboce Triangle Neighborhood Association




Supports amendments to the plan.


Suggested having a design guideline booklet for developers.


We would like the market based parking price be modified in the document.




Tim Dunn,
 
Duboce Triangle Neighborhood Association


-
 
 Affordable housing is very important for our neighborhood.


-
 
 Parcels on Octavia Boulevard are funded by Caltrain and not by developers.


-
 
 Requested a commitment be made for affordable housing - not only inclusionary.


Hiroshi Fukuda, Richmond Community Association




Commissioners mentioned not knowing what they are voting for.




-
 
 This plan is not ready to go forward.


Jim Haas, Civic Center




I noticed that you are preoccupied with the parcels on Van Ness and Market Street.


Two of those parcels belong to the City.
 


Adjacent to Civic Center, affordable housing currently exists. The area needs wealth to increase shoppers.




Marilyn Amini




This plan is not ready.
 
 You should not adopt it until you work out some details.


You would be adopting transit that is not consistent with the Housing Element.




Jason Henderson, HVNA


-
 
 I'm in support of the Plan and it should be moved forward.




Super inclusionary should be taken seriously.
 
 We do need affordable housing.


Tall buildings help include more affordable units.




Charles Chase, San Francisco Heritage




Committed to seeing that this plan is fulfilled through the completion of the survey with analysis.


This is a significant improvement in terms of types of controls.


The value of Transfer Development Rights for this plan is low.




Tom Radulovich, San Franciscan's for a Livable City


-
 
 I'm worried that the spirit of this plan will be lost.


-
 
 This new neighborhood is going to be different.
 
 It will be transit, walking and cycling oriented.




We need a balance of private and public benefits.


It is important to have inclusionary and affordable housing.




Peter Lewis, Mission Dolores Neighborhood Association




Mission Dolores is the oldest neighborhood in San Francisco and is cut in half by this plan.


We would like a comprehensive historic survey completed before going forward.




Mark Paez, Duboce Triangle Neighborhood Association




We support the adoption of the plan only after it is informed properly by the historic survey.


There are unresolved concerns about how historic preservation is going to be treated in this plan.


Suggested that the Commission take into consideration having an informational hearing with historic preservation consultants.




Jim Keith




With regards to Parcel I, it was an agreement and supported by the neighborhood to have a 55-foot height limit.


Now the proposal is to drop the height down to 45 feet.


I hope you looked at all the facts and considered that owners are committed to on- site affordable housing.




Patrick Spiers, Owner of Parcel I




We did a trade and agreed on a deal with the City.


We met with the neighborhood and it was suggested that we follow the guidelines of Octavia Boulevard.


We should have followed the initial agreement when we purchased the property with the 55-foot height limit.




Richie Hart


-
 
 With regards to Parcel 1 - height along the corridor would not be consistent.


-
 
 The Commission was urged to keep the height limit to 55 feet on Grove Street.


Kieran Buckley




Owner of Ivy Street lot, Parcel I.


The proposed height of 40 feet is not going to be consistent along the corridor.


The agreement was already made for 55 feet.
 
 It is important for affordable housing.




Angus McCarthy




Requested the 55-foot height limit on Parcel I.


The owners of the parcel have waited for over five years for this plan.




Stephen Haigh, Victorian Alliance




Plan areas include many valuable historic structures.


We would like the historic survey to inform the plan before the plan is adopted.




Peter Cohen




The plan talks in general about the building community.


I am certain that there will be some refining words in this plan.


There is a need for maintenance of structures and the transit analysis needs to be more specific.




Chris Foley




It has been a long time.
 
 You have had five years of community input through hearings.


I urge you to adopt it today.




Mary Miles, Coalition for Adequate Review




It is inconsistent with the general housing element.


This plan does not have any accountability for building affordable housing.


Density is too high.




Sue Hestor




There are a lot of projects in process around Civic Center.


It is important to have a cumulative climate analysis from Mission, Van Ness, and Market to 10
th
 Street.


This housing should be for workers in the city.
 
 It should be affordable and not luxury housing.




Judy




We were told in past hearings that there were no plan proposals to implement these re-zonings outside Market-Octavia.




-
 
 Answers have been misleading.
 
 There is another plan proposal for other parts of the city.

 In addition to providing information about the proposed General Plan, Planning Code and Zoning Map amendments, staff will also provide follow-up information on issues discussed at earlier hearings.
 


Together, the Commission actions are intended to implement the Market and Octavia Plan.
 
 In addition, an historic survey is currently being done of the project area; property owners considering constructing
 
 or altering a building in this area should consult with Planning Department staff to determine
 
 the historic resource status of their property.
 
 Property owners and interested parties are advised that height limits and other controls do not provide unqualified rights to development, but rather, proscribe the maximum potential building envelope that may be permitted; proposed buildings may not reach the maximum permitted building height/envelope.
 
 The Commission may also consider establishing interim procedures to guide the review of plans to construct new structures and alter existing structures to
 
 protect
 
 potentially eligible historic resources in the Plan Area prior to conclusion of an historic resources survey.
 


Members of the public may review a copy of the proposed amendments at the San Francisco Planning Department office at 1660 Mission Street 5th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94103, at the Public Library (the Main Library 100 Larkin St., and Harvey Milk branch library, 1 Jose Sarria Ct.

MARKET AND OCTAVIA PLAN AMENDMENTS
 


Adoption of amendments to the Planning Code
 for the area described in item 
23
 above.
 
 The proposed Planning Code amendment would revise Planning Code controls, including controls for land use, height and bulk, building design, loading, parking and establish new fees.
 


In order to fund the community improvements identified in the Plan, the Program document proposes to establish a Development Impact Fee, requiring the growth that generates the demand for additional infrastructure and services to provide some of the revenue required to fund the improvements.
 
 The proposal establishes a development impact fee on new residential and commercial development in the Plan Area.
 
 The fee proposal is $10.00 per square foot of residential development, and $4.00 per square foot of commercial development.


To encourage the provision of necessary and desirable public infrastructure improvements and also in order to mitigate the impacts of this increased localized density, the Department has established the Van Ness and Market Neighborhood Infrastructure Fund. Developers may provide in-kind public improvements (such as open space or streetscape improvements) or proportional in-lieu contributions to this fund that will allow the city to develop these facilities. The Department estimates that no more than 6 potential development sites would benefit from participating in the program. The Department has set the value of the additional FAR at par with the current market value of historic TDR credits ($15 per square foot).


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Adopt a Draft Resolution amending the Planning Code.

MARKET AND OCTAVIA PLAN AMENDMENTS
 


Adoption of amendments to the Zoning Map
 
for the area described in item
 
23 
above.


The proposed Zoning Map amendment would revise Maps 2 and 2H, 7 and 7H, and 2SU and 7SU.
 
 The proposed Planning Code text and map (Zoning Map) amendments would a) establish three new zoning districts, b) amend the Hayes-Gough, Upper Market, and Valencia Neighborhood Commercial Districts (NCDs), c) update height and bulk districts, d) establish the Market and Octavia Community Improvements Impact Fee, and e) make related revisions necessary to implement the General Plan.
 
 The proposed changes are described in greater detail in Case 2003.0347T (above). As part of Case No. 2003.0347T, the proposed Planning Code text amendment would revise Planning Code controls, including controls for land use, height and bulk, building design, loading, parking and establish new fees.
 
 The proposed amendments are described more fully below:


Establishment of Three Zoning Districts in the Plan Area


The Transit-Oriented Residential Use District (RTO) will replace most of the RH and RM districts zoning north and south of the Market Street corridor, extending north to Turk Street, west to Noe and Scott Streets, and South to Sixteenth Street. The proposed RTO district will encourage moderate-density, multi-family, and residential infill. Because of the availability of transit service, proximity of retail and services within walking distance, and limitation on permitted parking the RTO permits the construction of some housing without accessory parking. Parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing within buildings in keeping with neighborhood scale. Proposed heights in Residential Transit Oriented (RTO) Districts and RH districts primarily remain 40 and 50 feet as currently classified; in some RTO areas, permitted heights will change from 50, 80 and 105 feet to 40 and 50 feet.


A Neighborhood Commercial Transit District (NCT) will overlay the Hayes-Gough Neighborhood Commercial District and portions of the Upper Market and Valencia Neighborhood Commercial Districts within the Market and Octavia neighborhood.
 
 In named NCT and NC-1 (T) districts, parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing above ground-floor retail uses. These districts will largely keep the existing specific use-size controls. They include current Neighborhood Commercial Districts (Hayes-Gough, portions of the Upper Market, Valencia) and several parcels currently zoned NC-1.


The Van Ness and Market Downtown Residential Special Use District (VNMDR-SUD) will permit the development of a transit-oriented, high-density, mixed-use neighborhood around the intersections of Van Ness Avenue and Market Street and South Van Ness Avenue and Mission Street.
 
 This SUD will overlay existing C-3-G districts and existing C-M districts will be rezoned to C-3-G with this new VNMDR-SUD. Parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing in buildings with mixed-used podiums and some residential towers at two key intersections: Market Street and Van Ness Avenue and Mission Street and South Van Ness Avenue. Proposed heights in the Van Ness and Market Downtown Residential Use District (VNMDR-SUD) will change from 120, 130, 150, 160, 200 and 320 feet to 85, 120, 200, 320 and 400 feet; towers will be permitted over a podium of 85 or 120 feet; the highest towers will be permitted in the vicinity of the Market Street/Van Ness Avenue intersections.


In the Transit-Oriented Neighborhood Commercial Use Districts (NCT), height districts will change from 50, 80 and 105 feet to primarily 55, 65 and 85 feet; these districts will be located in SoMa West and along Market Street. The NCT district will largely replace C-M and NC-3 districts. In the NCT district, parking controls will establish maximum caps (instead of existing minimum requirements) and housing density will be controlled by building envelope to encourage housing above ground-floor retail uses. These districts will largely keep the existing specific use-size controls in place in the NC-3 district. Some heights on some parcels near Brady Street will change from 105 and 60 feet to 40 feet and 85 feet on parcels surrounding a proposed public open space.


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Adopt a Draft Resolution amending the Zoning Map.
