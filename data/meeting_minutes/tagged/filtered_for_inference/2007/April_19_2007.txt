Appeal of Preliminary Negative Declaration.
 
The project site (Assessor's Block 3736, Lots 74,75,76, 77 and 78A) is located in the Financial District on the south side of Tehama Street between First and Second Streets, adjacent to elevated freeway ramps to the south and west.
 
 The proposed project would involve the demolition of a 95-space surface parking lot and one-story storage shed and the construction of an approximately 302,200-gross-square-foot (gsf), 23-story, approximately 220-foot-tall, 198-unit residential building.
 
 The proposed development would include three subsurface parking levels with approximately 76 independently accessible parking spaces and 36 bicycle parking stalls, with primary pedestrian, bicycle and vehicle access from Tehama Street.
 
 The approximately 22,009 square-foot project site is within the C-3-O (SD) (Downtown Office Special Development) zoning district and a 200-S height and bulk district.
 
 The proposed project would require certification by the Zoning Administrator for transfer of development rights (TDRs); a Conditional Use authorization (CU) to increase dwelling unit density; and a variance from dwelling unit exposure requirements. The proposed project would also require exceptions to height limits for upper-tower extensions, separation-of-tower and rear yard requirements.

 The proposed structure would contain eight dwelling units over 750 square feet of commercial space and eight off-street parking spaces on the ground floor, and is located in the Valencia Neighborhood Commercial District and a 50-X Height and Bulk District.

SPEAKERS


Sue Hestor, Attorney for Discretionary Review Requestor


-
 
 Requested to be allowed to see presentation of new changes first.


-
 
 Information was not provided.


Toby Libbie, Architect




One of the neighbor's concerns was height.


Garage is shorter.


Set back of 5-feet on the front to allow plants and create a smaller appearance.




Sue Hestor




This is one of three projects in process on Valencia Street.




-
 
 All of them should be considered at the same time with the changes coming to this neighborhood.




Requested continuance to May 10.




-
 
 Impacts would be substantial because new zoning for set backs of 25 feet and not 5 feet, and it prohibits 1-to-1 parking ratio.


-
 
 If the main reason is to provide housing for project sponsor's employees, there should not be any opposition to condition it to not be converted to condominiums.


Julie Ledbetter




I am very concerned about developments in the neighborhood.


Requested an opportunity to consider all three projects in process and not just by piece.


Planning controls coming should be applied.


The Mission is a very low-income community and there is no housing to serve it.




Alexander Friend


-
 
 I am very concerned about condominiums because it is not going to serve this community.




We need to be a part of this very substantial change.




Peter Gabel




Many of us in the community are just becoming aware of these three projects.




-
 
 This community needs a moratorium on these three projects to maintain its unique current quality and character.


Pha Pha Hamilton




The height of these projects is not consistent with the area.


Murals are very important and would be blocked.


Concerned about the lack of affordability.


Schools are closing because people are moving away from the city.




Karen




All three projects should be considered together.


Lack of affordability is the main concern




Kamara Shephard


-
 
 Read a letter of opposition from New College Director.




Main concern is lack of affordable housing.




Teresa Mejia




Read a letter from Board of Women's Building.


Project does not help the district because we need affordable housing.




Danny Wala




Project would not provide benefits to the neighborhood.


Tall luxury buildings would block sun, view and Victorian-style houses.




Nick Pagoulatos




It is important to focus on how the process is.


The plan for this neighborhood has taken efforts from the community.


These projects are processing over 100 units and less than 10 are affordable.




-
 
 Continue this project to include proper community process and new policies for this district.


Robert Coller


-
 
 Size, site, and scale of the project are out of character.
 
 These are very important in a neighborhood.




It needs a comprehensive review.




Kim Malchewski




Proposition M's mission and character is to preserve family housing.


This project does not help family housing needs nor serve the community.




-
 
 It is very expensive and not consistent with neighborhood character


David Silverman, Project Sponsor


-
 
 This project was filed in September 2005.




Notices were sent out in the middle of January this year.




-
 
 The Discretionary Review requestor has refused to meet with us and mediate his main concern of market rate housing.




There is no proof of extraordinary circumstances or burden.
 
 Therefore, we are requesting approval of this project.




Larry Del Carlo, President of Mission Housing




Support this project because the Mission District needs all type of housing.


Most rental residents do not have opportunities to buy homes in the city.




Tuper Markers




Support this project.


We need more residential areas.
 
 It is a vital part of my future neighborhood.




Terri Zucker


-
 
 I have known the owner for a long time and he is a very hard working neighbor who is fully willing to collaborate.




The lot is vacant and this would be a good use for it.




Don Laurito




I am a 12 years employee of the project sponsor.


This is an opportunity to live with my family close to work.




Jeff Vigil




My bedroom faces the lot and lack of retail use increases disturbances at night.




-
 
 This lot should have been put in use long time ago.
 
 It would minimize activities in the lot and I'd have a more quite time.


Megan Musbach




Owner has mention he will use this project as rental housing for his employees.


This project is very small and it should be dealt with today.




Jeremy Paul




I am impressed with employee stability being there for a long time.


This site was a four-story Valencia hotel.
 
 It has been empty since the 30's.




-
 
 Asked the Commission to support the owner trying to survive and provide housing for his employees.


Jason Savelli, Cherin's Appliances




Support this proposal.
 
 It would benefit the neighborhood.




Sergio Nunez




Employed by project sponsor for 6 years.


This project would allow me to live with my family next to work.




Alex Luigi




I have been with the company for over 17 years.




-
 
 It would benefit my family to rent a unit in this project.
 
 I would be able to spend more time with my daughters.


Wenny Pangilinan


-
 
 I would like to see this project go up and live in one of the units next to work.


Jefrin Calo




I support project.


My family is expanding and I would like to live close to work in case of an emergency.




Lisa Honor




Having this building would empower the community by maintaining the automobile shop.




Ron Mallia, Owner




I have serviced cars for over 25 years in this community.
 
 I bought this lot in 1995.




-
 
 I just want to build these 8 family, residential, rental units for my employees and their families to come back to the city.


-
 
 There is a misunderstanding. There is a flyer around saying that luxury homes are replacing the auto shop. It is not true.


Jesse Waters




I support this very needed project.


It is not polite for people to come and raise their voice against; to share an opinion.




Douglas Jovel




Worker for one year and half supporting the construction.


It would provide an opportunity to rent a more comfortable apartment.




Joey Chinaman




I have been in the neighborhood for 18 years.


This project would prevent criminal activities.


I am a victim of a robbery.
 
 A thief jumped over the fence into my property through the empty lot.




Terence Biggins




Support the project.


Somebody mentioned what the neighborhood is going to look like in 20 years.


I am afraid it is going to look the same -- an empty lot inviting criminal activities.




Ana Sanchez




I live in Richmond and sometimes get home late because of the long distance.


Please support this project.


I have never seen any employer supporting his employees this way.




Toby Levine




I'm in support of this project.


It complies within the code and changes were made per request.


It is a fine effort to assist his employees by constructing housing in the neighborhood.




[No name]




I have the most recent draft Mission Plan, containing 47 pages.


The proposed height in the plan is 55 feet.
 
 This project is 53 feet.


It is consistent and in keeping with the neighborhood character.


Support the project.




Tobbie Libby




This project was designed with new rezoning in mind.


5 units have 2 bedrooms and 3 units have 3 bedrooms. It is a family-unit building.




James Nunemacker, Mission Miracle Mile




We are in full support of this project.


It is sad that it may not be approved because of the language.


There would be no loan for this building with springing conditions.




Connie Romero




I strongly support this project.


Owner is supporting his employees by providing housing.




Jerry




It is about time to use this vacant lot.


I urge you to approve it as is and do not include springing conditions.




John




Support the project.
 
 We need housing in the Mission.




-
 
 Submitted documents supporting that the bank would not lend with springing conditions.


Richard


-
 
 Support this project.




The Project Sponsor has a business and he would not be considered as a developer.




-
 
 It stands on its own merit and not on future potential fees.


Gina




The automobile business has declined.


Consider what that repair shop is paying for mortgage on an empty lot.


We would be losing housing and the repair shop.
 
 I hope you vote in favor of this project.




John Lira




This is the kind of property we need.
 
 I ask that you encourage this attitude.




 


ACTION:
 
 Took Discretionary Review and Approved with Modified Conditions:


-Include a public benefit fee of $13 per square foot for residential development and $4 a square foot for commercial development.


-Minimize appearance of the garage.

SPEAKERS


Guadalupe Arriola, Mission Anti-displacement Coalition




This project would substantially impact traffic, and impose social and economic impacts on this community.


The demographics of this neighborhood are very different form other parts of the city.




-
 
 Project would create displacement and unobtainable housing for populations in the Mission.




The parking being proposed is higher than needed and its being proposed with new zoning.


We have to consider projects and their impacts cumulatively.




Sue Hestor


-
 
 Mission and Cesar Chavez Streets are the highest pedestrian fatality intersections in the city.




The project should have a lot more affordable housing and a lot less parking.




Steve Vettel, Representing Project Sponsor




We have a socio-economic report for this neighborhood.




-
 
 It was published last month and provides a valve to prevent new housing conversions to condominiums and prevents displacement.




Current zoning requires a one-to-one parking ratio.


Transit would not be affected by this project.




-
 
 There are two alleys next to the property and the intersection of Mission and Cesar Chavez Streets is not that close to them.

SPEAKERS


Tom Roca, San Francisco Bay Seven Hills Properties




Working with the community, this process has been taken two and half years.


This is a 60-unit project for working San Franciscans and first time homebuyers.


Half of the units would be family housing.


15 % would be affordable and inclusionary would be built on site.




-
 
 Retail space on the ground floor includes a 24-hour Walgreens and space for two retail, service oriented businesses.


-
 
 Space is assign to Mission Education Project, Inc. with a substantial grant to continue working and educating children in the community.




The project has had a lot of changes based on community input.




Dave Johnson, Architect


-
 
 The final project design is the result of a process working collaboratively with the community, project sponsor and department staff.




There would be four retail spaces and its parking would be closed from 10pm to 7am.


The ground floor is designed to enhance the pedestrian experience.


There would be a courtyard with landscaping from RainWater Management.


The landscape architect is a neighbor of this district.


There would be a 64-foot mural executed by Precita's Eyes Foundation.


This is a three-story building with 60 dwelling units, including two and 3-bedroom units.




Steve Vettel




There is significant support for this project.




-
 
 Policy from the General Housing Element calls for the construction of new ownership units to ease existent rental housing and to prevent condominiums conversion.


-
 
 Our project could contribute to minimize housing market pressure and displacement in this neighborhood.


-
 
 It is consistent with current zoning and with the March 2007 draft zoning for the Eastern Neighborhood.


-
 
 The inclusionary percentage requirement for a project is 12 and we increased it to 15.


-
 
 We are committed to working with the Mayor's Office of Housing to try to access subsidies and possible below market-rate units.




We would work with MEDA to assist with access to these units for Mission District residents.


Requests were made to set aside this site for a Day Labor Center.




-
 
 In your packets is a letter from City Administrator, Ed Lee, confirming that the city has a new site on Bayshore Boulevard for a new Day Labor Center.


Nick Pagoulatos, Mission Anti-displacement Coalition




This development is bringing 52 market-rate units and just 8 affordable ones.


There is a critical need for affordable housing in the Mission.




-
 
 We need a long term planning program to create a mechanism to fund and target parcels most appropriate for truly 100% affordable developments.


-
 
 The Draft Area Plan for the Mission Corridor is proposed for neighborhood transit commercial requiring higher density, lower parking and is subject to super inclusionary.


-
 
 This project does not meet the need of this district.
 
 Half of the units are for single market-rate.


-
 
 The Planning Department has a pattern of recommending approval of market-rate projects with no concern of the neighborhood's need for 100 percent affordable housing developments.


-
 
 This Commission needs to address the lack of proper planning by holding up all projects for this District until the Neighborhood Plan is completed.


-
 
 We found a Community Development Partner who is willing to build 100% affordable housing at this site.


-
 
 We asked The Mayor's Office of Housing if they were willing to assist in purchasing this site and they agreed to fund this acquisition.


-
 
 With a development capacity and funding, a bonus fair market proposal was submitted to the developer.


Oscar Grande


-
 
 Displacement of working families has increased since 1990.




8,122 families were displaced by move-out owner notices from1994 to 2005.


14% of those displacements happened in the Mission.


Landlords are converting rentals to condominiums, increasing market-rate units.


8 or 9 units are inclusionary and those are still high for a lot of families in the neighborhood.


3 units of 3 bedrooms offered in this project are very little.


Besides affordability, there are traffic and pedestrian issues.


In 2005, this intersection was rated in the top ten high spots of pedestrian danger fatalities in the city.




 


Renee Salcedo, La Raza Centro Legal


-
 
 We are very concerned that this market rate project may deny day labor workers the right to stand on Cesar Chavez Street.


Araceli Catalan, Member of Saint Peter's Housing


-
 
 Being a low income, widow and mother of three children; it is very difficult to live in the city - either renting or buying a home.




Requested that the commission look very carefully at this project because it is not what the district needs.




Marisol Ramos




I oppose this project as condominiums.
 
 It should be rental housing.


We need to encourage less parking and more transit oriented neighborhoods.




Luis de Jesus, Saint Peter's Housing


-
 
 Suggested that the project should be constructed for people of medium and low income. And that space should be given for the Day Labor program.


Julio Loyola


-
 
 I believe that developments should be for the people who live in the area where they are being constructed.


Sue Hestor


-
 
 The City, Mayor's Office of Housing, was willing to buy the property and there was a developer willing to build 100-percent affordable housing at this site.




This project site is what the Mission needs.


This is a large site for housing and 64% of what is built should be affordable.




Rick


-
 
 There are so many Walgreens in the City already.
 
 Space should be used for more affordable housing and employment opportunities.


Jasmine Barrera, Saint Peter's Housing


-
 
 We presented our demands and needs to the Project Sponsor in November 2006 when communication started with them.

55 Laguna
 
 Mixed Use Project
 
- 
Public Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Report
 -The project site is located at 55 Laguna Street in the Hayes Valley neighborhood of San Francisco on the two city blocks bounded by Haight Street to the north, Laguna Street to the east, Hermann Street to the south, and Buchanan Street to the west. The proposed project would include new construction as well as renovation of most of the vacant buildings on the former University of California Berkeley Extension Campus to provide residential, community facility, retail space, open space and parking. The project site currently contains four buildings that were formerly occupied by educational uses, including Woods Hall, Woods Hall Annex, Richardson Hall and Middle Hall. The project site also contains the UCSF dental clinic that is currently in use. The project would renovate Woods Hall, Woods Hall Annex, and most of Richardson Hall to be used for residential and community facility space. Middle Hall would be demolished, as would the Richardson Hall Administration wing, a small single-story portion of Richardson Hall located at the north end of the building. New infill construction would include the development of seven new residential buildings ranging in height between three and eight stories. The tallest building, at a maximum height of 85 feet, would be built by an organization called open-house, specifically for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender seniors (hereinafter referred to as the open-house building). The proposed project would accommodate up to 450 residential units including approximately 85 units in the open-house building, approximately 10,000 sq. ft. of community facility space, and up to 5,000 occupied sq. ft. of retail space. The project would provide a variety of open spaces, including a privately owned, publicly accessible park, which would be located along the Waller Street alignment. The project would provide approximately 352 on-site parking spaces, including 51 spaces for the dental clinic and up to 10 spaces for a car share organization primarily within four below ground garages, and a small amount of above-ground parking. The project would require a change in the zoning district from P (Public) to RTO (Residential-Transit Oriented) and NCT-3 (Neighborhood Commercial Transit Moderate Scale Mixed-Use), new zoning classifications proposed for Market and Octavia Area Plan, or a mixed-used Special Use District. The dental clinic would remain in a P zoning district. The project would also require an adjustment in the height and bulk designations of the site from 40 X and 80-B to 40-X, 50-X and 85-X. The proposed project would also require an amendment to the San Francisco General Plan to allow the change from a public/institutional use designation to residential mixed-use designations, and to allow an increase in building heights.


Note: Written comments will be received at the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday April 24, 2007, at our new offices: 1650 Mission Street, Suite 400, SF, CA 94103; new fax: (415) 558-6409.
 
 Our MEA offices will be closed Friday April 20 and Monday April 23. Comments received or postmarked by April 24, 2007 will be accepted.


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 No action required.

 When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.
 
 Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.


 


The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.
 
 In response to public comment, the commission is limited to:


 


(1)
 
 responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or


(2)
 
 requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or




directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.
