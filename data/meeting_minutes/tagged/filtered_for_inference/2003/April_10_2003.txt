150 POWELL STREET
 - southeast corner of Powell Street and O'Farrell Street, Lot 22 in Assessor's Block 0327 - The applicant has requested approvals for two alternate, mutually exclusive uses, both of which would demolish three unrated buildings located on the project site, construct a new building connected to the east side of the existing 150 Powell Street building, and renovate that existing building, rated as Category IV under the Planning Code. The new construction and renovated 150 Powell Street building would have four stories, approximately 65 feet tall, and would include retail space, and a 3,600 gross square foot landscaped courtyard and lobby on the first floor. Both alternatives require a determination of compliance with the Planning Code pursuant to Section 309, with an exception to loading requirements. No parking would be provided as part of the Project.  Alternative (1) would provide ground floor and mezzanine retail, with the upper three stories used for 45 units of time share condominiums, categorized as a "hotel" use under the Planning Code and requiring a Conditional Use authorization. The basement would be used as accessory spa and gymnasium space for fractional ownership residents. This alternative has no parking requirements. Alternative (2) would provide ground floor, basement, and mezzanine retail, with the upper three stories used for 45 dwelling units, all uses permitted as of right. This alternative requires an additional exception under Section 309 (rear yard), and also must obtain variances from residential parking (eleven spaces), dwelling unit exposure, and open space requirements, at a concurrent hearing before the Zoning Administrator. The subject site is within a C-3-R (Downtown Retail) District, an 80-130-F Height and Bulk District, and the Kearny-Market-Mason-Sutter Conservation District.

8.  Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner Feldstein:


- The case for 150 Broadway was continued to May 8, 2003 and she understands that the project sponsor will want another continuance to May 15, 2003.  She will not be present for that hearing.  She would like to have the case moved to another hearing date.


- She would like to have return addresses on correspondence she receives from the public regarding cases coming before the Commission.  She discards any correspondence that does not have a return address.


Commissioner William Lee:


Re:  PageNet


- Apparently PageNet has not met their permit requirements by submitting their program implementation report to the Health Department.  What is the procedure to revoke their permit?


- Is their a way to find out which carrier has not submitted their reports?  And if they have not, what the procedure is to revoke their permits?


Director responded:  


- First he needs to find out if PageNet is in compliance with the conditions of whatever authorization they received.  If it is a requirement that they provide a compliance report within two years and they have not done so, that could be found as a violation of the conditions of approval.  What would have to happen is that a public hearing would have to be held by the Commission in order to consider whether the applicant is in compliance with the conditions of approval before any revocation is issued.  The Department is not able to take any administrative action.  Any time a decision is made by the Commission, it has to be undone by the Commission.


- When the Commission has issued an inquiry, then staff must schedule a hearing to consider revocation.  The Commission can only revoke if they find that the applicant is not in compliance.


Commissioner Antonini:


- He has been contacted by a number of people regarding the legislation from Supervisor Peskin regarding secondary units specifically in transit corridors in the City--which is quite extensive.


- A number of people feel that they have not been noticed adequately.


- He asked staff to make sure that the public gets notified.


Commissioner Bradford Bell:


- She would like to know if there is a regular procedure for staff to report to the Commission on violations of their authorization?


Director responded:


- The answer is No.  Staff will listen to the complaint, advertise a hearing for the intent to revoke.  If the Commission finds out about a complaint, any member of the Commission could call the Department and initiate an investigation.  It does not have to be done under Commissioner's Questions and Matters.  


- Staff does not go out on a regular basis to check for compliance.


- The implementation report is done by the applicant after authorization from the Commission and then submitted to the Health Department for their consideration and their input - specifically to Richard Lee.  Then the department would find out if the applicant meets the minimum requirements.


- Staff could assemble the information received from the Health Department on who has submitted their implementation reports and who has met the minimum requirements and then submit this information on a regular basis to the Commission.  The Commission could take a look at it and then decide if it should be discussed during a public hearing.


- Staff will work with the Health Department to find out if this is possible and come back with an opinion.

10. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals


BOS - 


Re:  40-50 Lansing Street


- The Director of Planning attended the full Board of Supervisors meeting held April 8, 2003.  The Board listened to the appeal of the Negative Declaration for 40-50 Lansing Street.  The Board after considering this matter for three hours, decided that they had a concern about the transportation area.  This was an issue for several of the Supervisors.


The Department used data from 1990 census material.  The Supervisors found that the Department should have been used the 2000 census data.


- Staff used the 1990 census data because the 2000 census data was not available.  Using the 2000 census resulted in different numbers.  Staff has determined that the difference in the numbers they used compared to the numbers the Board asked staff to use would 
not
 arrive at a different conclusion.


- Staff will change the information as it relates to the use of the 1990 census material.


- A public parking lot that was referenced as part of the project setting was no longer available because it was being used for construction material.  At the time that the initial study was done, the lot was available but not when the item came before the full Board.


- The final information was as it relates to loading and the impact on accessing First Avenue from the project site.  Staff was asked to go back with the project sponsor's traffic engineer and develop more specific numbers regarding traffic volume.  Staff will be able to do this but it will not change the conclusions.  The Board gave staff two weeks to develop this information and bring it back before them.


- Once the Board has all this information, the Director of Planning believes that they will uphold the Commission's actions.  This will allow the Commission to consider the Conditional Use.


Re:  Finance Committee


- The Director of Planning attended the Land Use Committee on April 9, 2003.


- There was legislation offered by Supervisor Peskin related to fee collections (this has not come before the Commission).


- The Development Impact Fees that are required of projects are collected by the Planning Department.  The Department is in charge of setting the fee or calculating the fee.  However, in other situations the fee is set by the Mayor's Office of Housing.


- The Transportation Impact Development Fee is not calculated by the Planning Department.  It is calculated by the Building Department and MUNI.  There are some very inconsistent and/or inefficient means by which all these fees are collected.  There was some controversy about whether these fees were collected or not.


- This legislation was drafted to achieve the goal of standardization and that the Treasurer's Office will be in charge of collecting the fees.  The Department will still be responsible for the process but not be allowed to approve and the Building Department will not be allowed to issue.  


- So basically, the responsibility is being transferred to the Treasurer.


- This will allow staff from the Planning Department to concentrate on the Planning efforts.


- It is appropriate to try to standardize this as well.


- The budget analyst report to the Finance Committee included eliminating a position that was responsible for tracking this.  There was an audit back in 2002, and it recommended that the Department provide a position at the Senior Administrative Analyst level that would be responsible for collecting these fees.  The Director of Planning recommended to the Finance Committee that this position is important because there is still a need to interface with the Treasurer's office and that it not be the responsibility of a planner to do all these calculations.


- The Treasurer and the controller agreed and recommend to the Board that this legislation be drafted but that the position be left in tact.  The Budget Analyst recommended that this position be kept until attrition.


- This will go before the Full Board in the near future.


BOA - 


Re:  725 Carolina Street - Discretionary Review 


- This project was heard by the previous Commission in June 2001.  


- The project sponsor was sent away to work with the two Discretionary Review (DR) requestors.  The DR applicants were concerned about intrusion into the rear yard at the second and third level.  The building got a little taller to make up for the space that was lost in the rear yard.  The DR applicants went away relatively happy.


- The building permit was appealed by residents who were not involved during the original Discretionary Review but were concerned about the increased height.


- Then the original Discretionary Review requestors got involved and felt that they were not aware of a roof deck at the fourth level.


- The Board upheld the Commission's decision.

50 OAK STREET, SAN FRANCISCO CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC
 - Certification of Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) - 
The proposed project is the seismic upgrade and major alteration of the existing four- to five- story Category II, Significant Building at 50 Oak Street, and demolition of the adjacent three- to four- story building and new construction of a six-story structure at 70 Oak Street, for the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.  The two structures would be combined into one, structurally integrated facility. The two existing buildings total about 91,000 gsf.  The Conservatory of Music would contain about 125,000 gsf, including about 19,200 gsf of performance space; 17,000 gsf of performing support space; 26,500 gsf of educational studios and spaces; 7,500 gsf of administrative office pace; 7,000 gsf of library space; 21,600 gsf of corridor and circulation space; and 26,200 gsf of service and storage space. Of the total area, about 98,500 gsf are applicable to the FAR under the Planning Code. No parking spaces or loading spaces are proposed.  The site occupies the north side of Oak Street, between the 25 Van Ness Avenue building and a parking lot at Hickory and Franklin Street, encompassing most of the half block bounded by Oak, Hickory, and Franklin Streets and Van Ness Avenue.  The site includes Lots 5 and 7, in Assessor's Block 834.  While the project would function as one building, it would appear as two buildings from Oak Street.  The project requires a lot line adjustment to merge the existing lots; a Permit to Alter for 50 Oak Street, a Category II, Significant Building, under Planning Code, Article 11; review of substantial alterations to existing buildings in the C-3 Districts under Section 309, including a request for exceptions to bulk limits (for maximum building length and maximum diagonal dimension), and a revocable encroachment permit from the Department of Public Works, to occupy sub sidewalk vaults.

(Continued from Regular Meeting of April 3, 2003)


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Erika Tarantino


- She spoke last time and would like to emphasize that this is the sixth continuance.


- She cannot understand why Verizon cannot get their documents together.


- She feels that this is just a tactic.


- All the surrounding neighbors are against this installation.


- The neighbors are against the antennas, the panels, and the 12 equipment cabinets that will be 8 feet tall.  And finally, they are against the fans that will make a lot of noise.


(-) Barbara Janeff


- She feels that there is no need for these antennas since there are five other carriers in the area.


- There is also no desire for these antennas either.  She has many signatures of people who are against the installation.


- Regarding compatibility, the equipment will be over built and over bulky.


(-) Kenneth Thompson - Beach/Buchanan Home Owners Association


- He lives on Beach Street.  He is also president of the Homeowners Association of the building he lives in.


- Everyone in the building is opposed to this installation.


- Regarding coverage and need:  He and his wife have Verizon cell phones and they work perfectly well in the area.


- All of the neighbors are concerned about the noise the fans will make.


(-) Robert Wales


- He lives on Beach Street.


- He displayed a map of where he lives and where the antennas are proposed to be installed.


- The maps that they received from Verizon are not supported by data.


- He has two Verizon phones and he has never had dropped calls so he really questions coverage.


- There is a question of integrity and corporate irresponsibility.


(-) Christine Varon


- She lives on Beach Street.


- Her daughter has been diagnosed with a devastating neurological condition that is very rare.


- She has read through packages of possible health concerns.


- She understand that this is not submittable but her daughter lives within 200 feet of where these towers are supposed to be.  She knows of other children who live near by.


- She knows that children are very susceptible to health concerns because of their developing nervous system.


- She has a Verizon phone and it works perfectly.


(-) Jacqueline K. Clemens


- She and her husband are part of the Beach Street Homeowners Association.


- Everyone in the apartment building they live in is opposed to this installation.


- She hopes that the Commission will hear everyone that is here today and not grant this approval.


- The neighbors are concerned with the protrusion of these antennas and equipment and the noise they will make.


(-) Sandra Schaefer - Pacific Union Real Estate


- She has about 20 real estate agents and they all have cell phones that work just fine.


- All their clients feel that she owns the building.


- She is concerned about the noise because her office is on the fourth floor and right next to the antennas.


(+) Eric Guarisco


- He lives on Northpoint Street.


- He feels that there is an issue of capacity.


- The capacity/coverage could be better.


- He cannot understand how in a City like San Francisco we do not have better cell phone service.


(-) Doug Loranger - SNAFU


- He read a statement from Bill Sanders, Deputy City Attorney which stated that in the Planning Code, necessity and desirability speak to the neighborhood and community's desire, and not Verizon's.


- Verizon needs to answer all of the questions stated here.


- He read Section 707 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, it states that local government should not prohibit or have the affect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services.  No Federal Appeals court has made any determination on the two issues put before the Commission:  capacity and next generation of wireless services.


- There is no data that shows that any of the neighbors of this area want or need these antennas.


- He would like to have this application denied today and not continued.


(-) Mark Longwood


- Two years ago, the Planning Department put together an inventory of antennas in San Francisco.  Even incomplete, these antennas numbered 2,400 then.  That is one antenna for about 333 people in this City.


- It is not uncommon for an antenna to have a coverage area of up to 20 square blocks.  How many people occupy 20 square blocks?


- Each application ranges from about 5 antennas each.


- At each meeting, most of the people against the installation are greater than those who are in support.


(+) Bill Hammet - Hammet and Edison


- He stated that he is speaking now because he will not be able to come back in two weeks.


- He spoke about data in reports submitted to the Health Department.


- He presented data which is in exact agreement with his report and that of the Health Department.


(+) Bill Wilson


- He read a letter from John Williams who is opposed to this application.


ACTION: Item continued to April 24, 2003.  Public comment remains open.


AYES: Antonini, Bradford Bell, Boyd, Hughes, Feldstein, S. Lee, W. Lee

Preliminary Recommendation:  Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project as modified.


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Rose Hillson - Discretionary Review Requestor


- She is concerned with the negative affects from the blockage of light and air to her lot, the lack of good neighbor gestures, and parking issues.


- It is not fair for the children in the nearby school; for toddlers to have most of the day be in shadows.

- The proposed project will have a one car garage and take away one street parking space.


- He would like to have more parking in the proposed structure.


- He is also concerned with the decrease in light and air because his parents are quite ill.  His parents cannot walk all over to get fresh air.


- The adjacent school will also have shadows most of the day and this is not healthy for children.


(-) Larry Jang


- He lives on 27
th
 Avenue.  His property is right behind the proposed project.

- He is also concerned with privacy issues.


(+) Daniel Ewald - Representing Project Sponsor


- The primary purpose of this project is to create a home for the project sponsor.


- This home will abide by all relevant provisions of the building and planning code.


- These provisions include:  mid-block open space and access of other properties to light and air.


- The project is in keeping with the scale and character of the surrounding neighborhood.  It is neither exceptional nor extraordinary.


- He prepared a shadow test and basically the results are that all of the images show that there is no shadow impact on adjacent properties.
