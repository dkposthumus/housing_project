) - Construction of Affordable 
          Housing, Childcare Facility, Retail Space and Parking. Lot 011 of Assessor's 
          Block 0141 - 
Appeal of Preliminary Negative Declaration
 for the 
          proposed new construction of 87 affordable housing units, 41 off-street 
          parking spaces (including 3 spaces for the City CarShare Program), a 
          3,500 square foot childcare facility, a community room, multi-purpose 
          room and offices associated with the residential use, 2,000 square feet 
          of retail space, and one freight-loading space. The proposed project 
          would consist of three separate buildings: one building would be three-stories 
          tall, or approximately 40 feet in height; a second structure would be 
          five-stories tall, or approximately 50 feet in height; and the third 
          structure would be eight-stories tall, or approximately 80-feet tall. 
          The proposed structures would contain approximately 128,000 gross square 
          feet. The site is approximately 30,948 square feet in size and located 
          at the northeast corner of Broadway and Battery Streets, with additional 
          frontage on Front Street. The site currently contains a ground-level 
          asphalt parking lot on a portion of the site and the remainder of the 
          site is vacant. The site was also the former site of the Embarcadero 
          Freeway off-ramp, and is owned by the City and County of San Francisco. 
          The project site is located within a C-2 (Community Business) zoning 
          district, the Northern Waterfront Special Use District No. 3, the Northeastern 
          Historic District, and an 84-E height and bulk district. The proposed 
          project requires Conditional Use authorization.

8. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals


Re:  1338 Filbert Street - Landmark of Cottages


- It was discovered that one of the four cottages (Lot 31) was under a separate ownership and there was a question about whether that owner was properly noticed.


- The committee therefore divided the ordinance in two: the first part dealt with 3 of the 4 cottages (specifically lots 32, 33 and 34).  They were passed out of committee and was approved on first reading by the full board on Tuesday, March 4.


- The second part of the ordinance dealt with the fourth cottage (Lot 32) which is under separate ownership.  This will be considered at the March 17
th
 meeting of the Land Use committee.  Both items are expected to be heard at the Full Board's meeting of March 18 and as a technical matter, the Board may decide to join both ordinances when considering the matter.


Re:  Conditional Use Appeal for 1193 Oak Street


- This appeal was heard by the Commission on January 9, 2003.  It consists of a project to establish a bed and breakfast inn within the second floor dwelling unit.  A public hearing on the appeal was held and the item was continued for three weeks and will be heard once again at the March 25 meeting of the Board of Supervisors.  Questions were raised by members of the Board about the possible loss of housing if this CU were upheld, and about the eviction history at this address.


Re:  1250 Haight Street


The Land Use Committee approved the package of legislation that essentially amends the Planning Code and Zoning maps to create the Haight Street Senior Affordable Housing Special Use District.


- The Commission had approved the Conditional Use application for this 40-unit affordable senior housing project by the Citizen Housing corporation pending the final adoption by the approval by the full Board, which will consider the items for first reading on March 17, 2003.


Re:  Conditional Use Revocation Ordinance by Supervisor Gonzalez


- The Land Use Committee also approved Supervisor Gonzalez's ordinance allowing for the revocation of a Conditional Use authorization upon finding that the applicant provided false information in obtaining the Conditional Use.  The Land Use Committee also incorporated this Commission's recommendations with amendments that clarify what constitutes "false information" that could justify revocation of Conditional Use approval and by setting a time period of one year to receive such information from the effective date of the Conditional Use authorization.


Re:  Cancelled Meetings


- The Land Use Committee and the Full Board meeting are cancelled next week as many members of the Board will be in Washington DC to attend a local legislators' conference.


Re:  Dog Patch Historic District.


- The Land Use Committee will consider the legislation establishing the Dog Patch Historic District which has already been passed by the Landmark's Advisory Board and the Planning Commission on March 24, 2003.


Re:  Alcohol Restricted Use District


- The Land Use Committee will also consider another ordinance that has been considered by this Commission, which is Supervisor Maxwell's legislation creating a Third Street Alcohol Restricted Use District.  This would prohibit any new liquor establishments and would regulate existing non-conforming liquor establishments in this new Restricted Use District.
