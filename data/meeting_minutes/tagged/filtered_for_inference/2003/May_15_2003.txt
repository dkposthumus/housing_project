Hearing on the Appeal of a Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration.
  The proposed project includes the construction of a four-story, 40-foot high, 97-room tourist hotel containing approximately 49,000 sq. ft. of hotel area and the demolition of the existing two-story, 30-room tourist hotel/motel of approximately 8,630 gross square feet (sq. ft.).

The project site is in an NC-3 (Moderate-Scale Neighborhood Commercial) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.

8. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals


BOS:


- On May 13, 2003, the full Board of Supervisors heard the following appeals:


1) 2690 Harrison Street


- This is a 54-unit residential project.


- The Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition filed an appeal.


- After a 4-hour hearing on the matter, public comment was closed and the item was continued until this morning


2) 1017 Ocean Avenue


- Verizon Wireless antennas.


- This item was continued to June 10, 2003.


3) Other appeals


- Wharf J-10:  fish processing tenants of this pier have filed an appeal of the statutory exemption from CEQA review for the emergency demolition that was issued on April 15.  The Board at its June 10, 2003 hearing will hear the appeal.


- O'Shaugnessy Dam Negative Declaration:  the appeal for this project will be heard on June 10, 2003.


- Secondary Unit Legislation:  an appeal was filed for this legislation.  The appeal was filed for environmental review exemption by a group called Coalition to Protect our Neighborhoods. 


- State law grants a Statutory Exemption from environmental review for secondary unit legislation that affects single family dwellings, but not for multiple family dwellings.  The Planning Department issued a General Rule Exclusion Exemption from CEQA review for that portion of the legislation that affects multiple dwelling units, and it is that determination that has been appealed.  No date has been set for the appeal hearing, but it is expected that this will be heard by the full Board prior to the issue returning to this commission for your recommendation on the legislation.


Re:  2690 Harrison Street


Erick Quezada


- The Board of Supervisors was able to hear from a diverse group of people regarding this item.


- There were a lot of racist comments at the hearing.


- Family housing and affordable housing are priorities in the Eastern Neighborhoods.


James L. Collins


- He felt insulted by the comments made at the Board of Supervisors regarding this project.


Richard Marquez


- The project sponsor made very racist comments that were inappropriate.


- Procedurally, he imagines that the Commission cannot do anything about this.


- There is a high level of frustration regarding this project.


Cristina Logie


- She just wanted to clarify that the project sponsor for this project did not make racial statements directed to the Asian or African-American communities.


Ada Chan


- The Commission needs to be able to say no to projects that are not good for the community.


Joe O'Donaghue


- He read the full text of the remarks made by Mr. Milton Gaines.  


- There were sentences in it that he would have disagreed with, but he takes the position of defending the right of Mr. Gaines to say what he said.


- He read it in a different context than with the emotionalism by which those remarks were made.


- He believes that Mr. Gaines is sending many people the full text of his remarks with a letter of explanation.


- Mr. Gaines empathizes with the problems in the Mission.  [For instance], there were statements that identified in particular where poverty was coming from, etc.


- Could Mr. Gaines have said the same thing in a different way?  Yes, he could have. 


- This is a healthy dialogue and it's a good one.


David Lupo - Carpenter's Union


- He was also shocked at the comments that the project sponsor made.


- There are no Latino workers at the job site of this project.


Joel Yodowitz


- The project is consistent with the long range planning for the Mission District.

(Continued from Regular Meeting of May 8, 2003)


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Jill Simpson-Rodby - Port of San Francisco - Maritime Marketing Manager


- She commended staff for a great job on this project.


- Her only concern is the designation of mixed use residential between Third and Illinois Street.


- She is concerned that if housing is allowed in that area it will be incompatible with industrial uses on port land.


- She would like to see all residential housing west of Third Street so there is a buffer between industrial zoning and housing.


(-) Mariuccia Iaconi


- She operates an educational distribution to schools and libraries.


- She is opposed to the PDR zoning of her neighborhood.


- The evolution from a raged industrial residential area to one where organizations now exist should be respected.


- Friends of Esprit Park saved Esprit park from becoming another live/work development.


(-) Drew Detsch - Friends of Esprit Park


- This was a burned out community.  The residents lived in a state of siege.


- Out of the development of Esprit Park, a community was born.


- All this was able to be done due to the M-2 zoning area.


- The new PDR zoning does not allow residential even with a conditional use.


- Flexibility is definitely necessary.


(+) Ira Maybaum - San Francisco Dry-dock


- He has been in the area since the 70s.


- His company is the only ship repair in Northern California.


- When the shipyard is working on a cruise ship, they have to work around the clock and this generates noise and light.


- Having residential use east of Third Street would be a continuing problem.


(-) Michael J. Burke - Attorney for ECOR-SF Holdings, Inc. (formerly Esprit)


- He is not in agreement with designating the area to PDR.


- PDR uses would [not] support the near term capital expenditures and long term maintenance costs necessary to preserve this historic asset.


- ECOR requests that the land use designation be changed from PDR to mixed-use residential.


(-) Kate White - Housing Action Coalition


- She believes that the best course for the Planning Commission is to direct Planning staff to reconsider objectives, policies, and land use proposals and come back with a plan that better reflects a balance of the needs of the Central Waterfront and the City as a whole.


- She would be happy to work with the Planning Department in making this a stronger plan.


(-) Oz Erickson - Emerald Fund


- His organization does not have any property interests in the Central Waterfront.


- This is a terrible plan.


- He would recommend that the Commission instruct Planning staff to start over.


(-) John M. Sanger - Counsel to RAM Development


- His clients have worked very successfully with Potrero Boosters and the Dogpatch Neighborhood Association.  They have received approval for their projects from both organizations.


- This plan has one fatal flaw.  It is perceived from a biased point of view that there must be a very [heavy] handed effort to provide an expansion of PDR uses and to protect PDR uses from new residential/commercial development.


(-) Marina Secchitano - ILWU


- She is very concerned about the potential impact for Maritime Industrial in the Port of San Francisco.


- The designation of mixed-use residential between Third and Illinois and Mariposa and 25
th
 Streets need to be thought out and that there be a buffer zone.


- The shipyard works 24 hours [a day] and this could cause problems with residential use.  There is a lot of activity that does not need to be shared with residential use.


(+/-) Joe Boss


- He lives in the Dogpatch area.


- The planning staff should be praised for their work but the plan has failed.


- The Planning staff needs to go back and start all over.


(-) Steve Vettel


- He did not participate in the Central Waterfront Plan, but he did participate in the Neighborhood planning.


- The notion that there should not be people living around Esprit Park is not a good idea.  People need to be around the area.


- It is time to look at this from scratch and reexamine the goals.

Section 151 of the Planning Code requires one parking space be provided for each six beds, with a minimum of two spaces required.  The proposed project includes one parking space and a variance is requested to provide only one off-street parking space.  Section 134 of the Planning Code requires a minimum rear yard of 25% of the total depth of the lot.  The existing rear yard is 10% and does not therefore meet this requirement.  The proposal is to establish group housing for 15 youth in an SLR (Service/Light Industrial/Residential Mixed Use) Zoning District and in a 50-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions


SPEAKER(S): Same as those speakers listed for item 17a.
