Future Meetings/Agendas
.  
At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a 
Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda 
of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.




 





Commissioner Antonini
:  
Over the past year we have lost some major leaders in San Francisco, among them 
Don Fisher, Walter Shorenstein, and most recently Richard Goldman.  Although a 
Marin resident most of his life, Mario Ghilotti has recently died.  I think 
there is a common thread among these leaders that they created so much and gave 
so much back in charity to their communities.  I think that it is really 
important that we continue to establish a climate in San Francisco to attract 
and retain such leaders for the future.  I think that is one or our challenges.  
I think Mr. Ghilotti was typical of these leaders and unfortunately his death 
was caused by a fall at age 88 rushing to his office on a Saturday so he could 
get his work done and attend his grandsonâs football game after it.  This is the 
kind of drive that was so typical of the people Iâve named.  We need to continue 
to have more of that in the future.





Commissioner Borden
:  
I just want the public to be aware that I was selected for a jury and I will not 
be at the regularly scheduled hearing next Thursday and I will most likely not 
be at the regularly scheduled hearing the following Thursday.





Commissioner Miguel
:  
Iâll just mention that I have met with people regarding 2001 Market Street and 
some individuals regarding the CVS pharmacy projects in San Francisco.





Commissioner Antonini
:  
I neglected to say that I too have met with representatives of both those same 
projects also within the last week. 




 


C.         DIRECTORâS REPORT




 




8.         
Directorâs Announcements




           





Director Rahaim
:  
Good afternoon commissioners.  I just want to mention a couple of things.  There 
are two meeting next week I want to remind you of.  I believe you have received 
notice of them.  One is Wednesday the 8
th
 at 5:45 p.m. at the 
Department in room 431.  We are hosting a discussion on the Housing Element.  
The public is invited.  Also Saturday morning, December 11
th
 at the 
Department at 10 a.m. we are having a discussion of the Departmentâs Action Plan 
and the most recent changes to the Development review Process that we are 
proposing to you and is the subject of your memo that you have in your packets 
today as well. With respect to the Action Plan, we will be calendaring this for 
a full hearing in January.  I just want to call your attention to the memo that 
is in your packet that outlines the status of the Departmentâs reforms; and in 
particular it highlights our proposed revisions to the Development Review 
process.  As it says in the memo, we have piloted this process with a couple of 
projects and believe this a very solid way of moving forward and I feel really 
good with the way staff has come up with this process that I think will be more 
transparent and create more certainty for project sponsors.  We will have a 
hearing at both the Planning Commission and the Historic Preservation Commission 
in January on that item.




I also want to 
call to your attention the memo regarding vehicle queuing that is in your 
packets.  You may be aware this has received some media attention.  We had 
initially proposed this as what we perceived to be a somewhat growing problem of 
queuing on some types of retail establishments in the city â especially large 
grocery stores.  There had been discussion as you know â a condition of approval 
that would require at some point â paying to park if the queuing would 
continue.  After further analysis of that, what we have proposed is a standard 
condition in the future for these types of projects that would essentially not 
allow a queue.  The way the standard condition would read is that there is the 
responsibility of the owner and the operator to make sure that there is no 
queuing there and there would be certain conditions that would be put in place 
that allow us to make that determination and to take further action in the 
future should there be a queue.  I think this solves the issue.  The goal of the 
Department with respect to the potential to pay for parking was not to charge 
for parking but to address the queue.  This condition in fact addresses that 
more directly and we believe that this is a much more workable solution.  Our 
proposal is to use this as a standard condition now on future parking spaces of 
more than 20 spaces.
