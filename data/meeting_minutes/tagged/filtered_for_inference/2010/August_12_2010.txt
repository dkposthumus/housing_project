Treasure Island/Yerba Buena Island Redevelopment Project
- 
Public Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Report
 - 
The Treasure Island Development Authority (TIDA), the redevelopment agency for the project, is proposing a 
Redevelopment Plan for the Treasure Island/Yerba Buena Island Project
 that would provide the basis for redevelopment of portions of Naval Station Treasure Island, owned by the Navy, once they are transferred to TIDA. 
The project site is located on Treasure Island and Yerba Buena Island and the immediately surrounding waters (Assessors Block 1939, Lots 1 and 2). The proposed project would 
include development on Treasure Island and Yerba Buena Island of up to 8,000 residential units; up to 140,000 square feet (sq. ft.) of new commercial and retail space; up to 100,000 sq. ft. of new office space; adaptive reuse of three historic buildings on Treasure Island with up to 311,000 sq. ft. of commercial, retail, and/or flex space; about 500 hotel rooms; rehabilitation of the historic buildings on Yerba Buena Island; new and/or upgraded public and community facilities; new and/or upgraded public utilities; about 300 acres of parks and public open space including shoreline access and cultural uses such as a museum; new and upgraded streets and public ways; bicycle, transit, and pedestrian facilities; landside and waterside facilities for the Treasure Island Sailing Center; landside services for an expanded marina; and a new Ferry Terminal and intermodal Transit Hub.  
Infrastructure improvements would include geotechnical stabilization to improve seismic safety.  The proposed project would also include green building specifications, programs to encourage transit use, design standards that would enable photovoltaic panel installation on most roofs, recycled water use, and other features promoting sustainability. 
Construction and build-out would be phased and would be anticipated to occur over an approximately 15- to 20-year period. T
he proposed project would require amendments to the San Francisco Planning Code and the 
San Francisco General Plan.
  The Draft EIR identifies potentially significant, unavoidable environmental impacts on aesthetics, historic architectural resources, transportation, noise, air quality, wind and biological resources.
