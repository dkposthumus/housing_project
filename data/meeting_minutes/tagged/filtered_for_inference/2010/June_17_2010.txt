Public Hearing on an Appeal of the Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration. 
The approximately 80,000-square-foot project site is on the Main Campus of the University of San Francisco, in the existing Harney Green and Harney Plaza area. The proposed project includes removal of Harney Green and Plaza; site excavation; and construction of a three-story with a partial fourth floor, 53-foot high building with a partial basement, which would connect on all floors to the south end of the existing Harney Science Building, and a below-grade, two-level structure, which is also a component of the proposed project.  The roof of this building would serve as a new plaza and pedestrian area.   Together, the new structures would have approximately 60,000 square feet of classrooms, laboratories, instrumentation rooms, and building mechanical/support spaces. The project site is within an RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District and an 80-D Height and Bulk District.  The proposed project would require Conditional Use Authorization for a post-secondary institutional use in an RH-2 District, and for exceeding a building height of 40 feet in an R District.

COMMISSIONERSâ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS
 


 


6.         Commission Comments/Questions


        
Inquiries/Announcements
.  Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).


        
Future Meetings/Agendas
.  At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.


 


Commissioner Moore:


Iâd like to mention an article by John King â you may remember last year when we talked about the maintenance of the interim use of empty parcels, he reports in wonderful terms about a garden which has sprung up at the freeway ramp at Market Octavia; and he is also talking about the 45 Lansing Street lot which we have spent a lot of time particularly because it is in an area which has already being populated with people having nothing to look at.  That is a combination of an art and garden project and I am very pleased to hear that the first volunteers are stepping to the line to do this.  I hope there will be many more because we do have quite a few empty lots which are quite unsightly at the moment.


Commissioner Antonini:


Also in the press â I believe it was a week ago Sunday â an excellent article on Mid-Market, a two part series talking about the challenges there.  It was quite insightful and I think he addresses a lot of the causes that are keeping the area in the state itâs in.


Commissioner Sugaya:


Last week we had a presentation at Public Comment from Mission Dolores, Duboce Triangle and other groups about upper Market and some conflicts, or issues they saw with unresolved zoning problems.  I canât remember if Director Rahaim in response â I canât remember what he said.  In any case, if we can have staff take a look at that and perhaps get back to us â there were specific lots pointed out; there were specific zoning issues surrounding that.  If we could have that followed up on â¦


Commission Secretary Avery:


Last week Director Rahaim did say that he would have staff follow up on this.


 


Commissioner Miguel:


Also as to Commissioner Mooreâs comments, I had the pleasure of talking to John King regarding that article and I really appreciate the fact that he brought it out to the public.  And that same thing is happening on something that goes back a long time with me and that is the Central Freeway/Octavia Blvd. lots that are going into production right now.  Commissioner Sugaya and I were both attending last night a Japantown meeting regarding the Japantown Task Force.  They are getting together again and starting to move ahead.  Paul Lord was there who has taken over for the Department in that regard.  It was a very nice attendance.  I wanted to mention that Urban Land Institute has just put out an excellent synthesis of what is happening (with SB375) and what may happen and perhaps the best thing about it is the last two pages contain the most extensive bibliography I have yet seen on SB375.  It is very complete.  If you are looking fro anything from development trends to public health, to property values, to job creation â you name it and it is all set out here in very nice form.  Iâll pass it around but would like it back.  Iâm sure Kate White at ULI will be happy to supply it to you.  The big book of all the material is about this thick [indicating about 2 inches] and that would cost if anyone wanted it, but basically I thought it was an excellent reference guide on SB375.  


Commissioner Olague:


I lost track of time.  I forgot we started today at 1:00 and I was busy watching Mexico in the soccer game [background laughter].  I want to apologize for that.  


 


C.         DIRECTORâS REPORT


 


7.         Directorâs Announcements


 


Kelley Amdur:


We truly expected Director Rahaim to be able to be here.  We were scheduled to be heard before the Budget Committee early this morning on our budget.  I am not prepared to give a Directorâs Report in full.  However, I can report since I was in attendance at the 
Historic Preservation Commission
 hearing yesterday that they did take action yesterday â they took a motion of intent related to the North Beach Library on a vote of 4 to 3 to move forward with designation of that structure.  That motion of intent will come back in two weeks before that body.               


 


Director Rahaim (comments were made after item 8):


Sorry Iâm late, but I was at the Budget hearing.  The Budget Committee approved our budget within five minutes.  It was quite painless actually [background expressions of congratulations and laughter].  Supervisor Avalos made a point of thanking the Department for the Joint Labor Management Committee, which I mentioned in my presentation.  He was very complimentary on that.  


The only other thing I wanted to mention, and President Miguel asked me about this earlier, was in terms of my own activities, Iâve been involved with a number of Department Heads recently on the high-speed rail proposal.  They are in the process of doing whatâs called Alternative Analysis and are asking for comments on their alternatives within the next month or so.  There is a staff-level group that is meeting on a regular basis on technical issues and I am also meeting with Department Heads to look at the alternative alignments and what the potential pros and cons of various alignments are to the city.  They are on a process of doing the draft EIR I believe by the end of this year and the final by the end of next year.  So itâs a pretty fast schedule for such large project.  We had a very constructive meeting with them yesterday and we will be meeting with them over the next few weeks over this alternative issue.


Commissioner Miguel:


Thank you.  The reason I contacted the Director was that I was particularly concerned, as are a number of people in the neighborhoods and others regarding the 16
th
 Street crossing, which is a problem area I guess.  If you could give us an update from time to time regarding the high-speed rail, Iâd greatly appreciate it.   


8.         Review of Past Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic Preservation Commission.


 


BOARD OF SUPERVISORS


 


Land Use Committee:


        
Informational hearing only on the 12 ordinances for the Bayview Hunters Point shipyard/Candlestick Point Project â 
This project would create 10,500 new units, 3.7 million square feet of commercial and retail space, a performing arts theater, an artistsâ colony, and possibly a new waterfront stadium for the San Francisco 49ers.  The Land Use Committee heard presentations from the Mayorâs Office, the Redevelopment Agency and the Planning Department staff.  This hearing was part of a series of informational hearings that the Land use committee has heard on the project.  This weekâs hearing focused on the 12 draft ordinances that will be before them for action.  You heard the draft ordinances under your purview at the June 3
rd
 joint hearing with the Redevelopment Agency Commission.  While your hearing lasted 13 hours, this weekâs hearing at the Land Use Committee was only three hours long.  
These items will be heard by the Committee on or after July 12 at which time the Committee may be able to take action.


 


Full Board of Supervisors:


        
Double Density Bonus â 
This ordinance was introduced by Supervisor Chiu and would amend Section 209.1(m) of the Planning Code which previously provided a double density bonus if projects include senior housing or housing for people with disabilities.  The amendments will create a definition related to housing for seniors; strike the provision to allow the density bonus for people with disabilities; update the requirements for obtaining double density bonuses by providing senior housing; and require in certain circumstances a conditional use authorization for obtaining a double density bonus for senior housing.  This Commission heard this on October 8, 2009 where you recommended approval.  There was one amendment made at the Land Use Committee that would link the on-site affordable housing provisions to the pending Section 315 legislation.  
As amended, the Full Board passed this item on FINAL reading.
   Last week this Commission requested some additional information on this item.  In response to your questions, I wanted to share a couple of facts with you and will give the Commission Secretary the staff report from when you heard this last fall.


1.
      
With regard to the definition of âseniorâ the legislation created two categories of housing definitions for senior citizens:


        
Senior citizen is a person who is 62 years of age or older; or


        
If a development has 35 units, then the age limit for a qualifying senior citizen is lowered to 55 years of age or higher.  NOTE:  Therefore, if a proposed development will contain less than 35 units, all of the residents must be 62 years of age or older.  If there are 35 or more units, the residents can be 55 years of age or older.


2.
      
Projects that could apply for the density bonus would be subject to 311/312 notification and could be subject to Discretionary Review.


        
Sacred
 Heart Church
 â This was an urging resolution to urge DBI to diligently monitor the status and condition of the Historic Sacred heart Church, seeking re-installation of the exterior stained glass windows and requesting the City Attorney to open an investigation for the purpose of enforcing possible violation of the Building and Planning Codes.  
This week the Board chose not to act on the resolution but instead referred  it to the Land Use Committee


 


Introductions:


        
Supervisors Alioto-Pier, Dufty and Daly introduced interim zoning requiring conditional use authorization for change in use or reduction of child care facilities
 â as an interim resolution this would go directly before the Board and permanent controls would come before the Planning Commission at a later date


        
Board President Chiu submitted his nominations for the Planning Commission
 for the term ending July 1, 2014.  Both Commissioners Kathrin Moore and Hisashi (Bill) Sugaya have been nominated for re-appointment.  These nominations will be heard by the Rules Committee in the near future.

 - 
Public Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Report
 - The project site is located on about 152 acres of land adjacent to Lake (Assessors Block 7303, Lot 1, 7303A, Lot 1 7308-7311, Lot 1, 7314, Lot 1, 7316, Lot 1, 7319-7326, Lot 1, 7330, Lot 1, 7331, Lots 1-5, 7332, Lots 1-4, 7333, Lots 1-3, 7345, Lot 1, 7333 A-B, Lot 1, 7333E, Lot 1 and 7353-7370, Lot 1). The Proposed Project would increase residential density, provide new commercial and retail services, modify transit facilities, and improve utilities within the site. A new Pre K-5 school and day care facility, a fitness center, and new open space uses, would also be provided. About 1,683 of the existing apartments located in 11 tower buildings would be retained. Over a period of approximately 20 years, the remaining 1,538 existing apartments would be demolished and replaced, and an additional 5,679 net new units would be added, resulting in a total of about 8,900 units on the site. The transportation system modifications would include rerouting the existing Muni Metro M Ocean View line through the development. Infrastructure improvements would include the installation renewable energy sources, such as wind turbines and photovoltaic cells.  The Proposed Project would require amendments to the San Francisco Planning Code and the 
San Francisco General Plan.
  The Planning Code amendments would change the Height and Bulk District Zoning Map and would add a Special Use District (SUD) applicable to the entire Project Site.  A Development Agreement is also proposed, which would be accompanied by the proposed 
Park Merced Design Standards and Guidelines
 with specific development guidelines. The transportation improvements would require approval of the San Francisco Municipal Transit Authority, the California Public Utilities Commission, and Caltrans. The DEIR identifies potentially significant, unavoidable environmental impacts on aesthetics, historic architectural resources, transportation, noise, air quality, wind and biological resources.
