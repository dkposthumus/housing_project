Commissioner Antonini:


Last night there was a soccer game going on at Candlestick between the national teams of Mexico and Bolivia.  The city and the 49ers are working together to try to produce more revenue of Candlestick.  It is an under used asset we have, owned by Park and Rec.  One of the things that is being explored is getting the Cal Bears here because they are going to be out of Memorial Stadium for at least one season (2011) and probably two.  This is promising.  The 49ers have mentioned that they are not opposed to spending revenue to put in improvements.  They are working closely with Park and Rec.


Also, I did notice today there was an article in the Chronicle and Examiner about the Fee Deferral and the Mayor.  There is one area in that article that is little confusing and I just want to mention that when we talk about the incremental benefits of these deferrals that it is incremental.  The numbers that Ted Egan was talking about are his anticipation of the incremental number of units that this legislation would provide.  Obviously, the number of units could be significantly more because each of these projects are quite large and conceivably as many as 1200 residential housing units are involved.


Commissioner Olague:


Iâm not sure if this is a planning issue or not, so if it isnât just let me know and Iâll seek information elsewhere.  Weâre coming upon the Housing Element, and in the Housing Element I believe we do look at the issue of homelessness in San Francisco.  It seems to me that the only policy that the city has currently that really does aggressively review that issue of homelessness is the Care Not Cash Program.  I want to look at homelessness in the context of the Housing Element.  Iâm wondering just how does that relate or not to that document and to the analysis that is provided in that document.  There are some issues that have been brought to my attention recently about some of the short comings of the Care Not Cash and how it doesnât address the entire population of homeless people out there.  Iâm just wondering where I might pursue some answers to my questions about that.


 


 


Director Rahaim: 


Iâll have staff get back to you on that, but the short answer is that there are pieces of the Housing Element that deal with providing housing for the homeless.  Iâm not sure it goes much beyond that.  So I will have Sarah Dennis get back to you on that.


Commissioner Olague:


Okay.  I was recently approached by some neighborhood folks regarding the AstroTurf project near the Beach Chalet by Ocean Beach.  I was wondering where it is in the Planning Department and I know at one point a Cat Ex was issued.  I donât know if that is still a current document or not.  I want to know if that is something the Planning Commission will ultimately be reviewing and just where we are in the process within the Planning Department.


Director Rahaim:


That project is within MEA.  There is an environmental review that is being conducted.  There was a Cat Ex that was for that as a number of different projects in Golden Gate Park about four or five years ago. But this project was never approved by the Rec. Park Commission so there was never an appeal period established.  The Department has raised some concerns about some of the environment issues and we are working with Parks on that right now.  So there will be a new environmental review done.  I believe it will still be a Cat Ex, at least that is our current thinking.  The Commission doesnât see that.  It is a Parks project.  The only way the Department gets involved is through the environmental review process.  So that is underway and we expect to be done I think in a couple of months.


Commissioner Miguel:


I just want to mention that I met with the Department and a group regarding a project that will be coming up in a while on 5
th
 and Folsom.  But also there was a very good meeting â This week the Potrero Boosters gave up their regular monthly meeting night and turned it over to Rebuilt Potrero, which is the rebuild of the Potrero Tennis Terrace and Annex public housing.  They had over 150 people in the room.  It was an excellent meeting.  Even after over a year and a half of very heavy outreach there were still a large number or people there who had not been involved before, which is what they are striving for.  Although the project still has a long way to go, they are really engaging both the neighborhood and the residents of housing, as far as I can tell, very thoroughly. 


 


C.         DIRECTORâS REPORT
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
4.         Directorâs Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


Good afternoon commissioners.


Last night we had a public meeting on the northeast waterfront work we are doing on the Embarcadero; the similar format as to the last meeting we had late last year where we made a presentation about the refinements of our proposal based on the public comments we received over the past three months.  We issued a new draft of our proposed guidelines and then we had a conversation with the public around 11 or 12 tables at the Port Commission room.  The process has gone well the last few months.  I dare say better than it did in the beginning of the process.  We have the report out for public comment.  We are asking for the publicâs comments on that work by the end of March.  In April we will prepare a final open house for the public to see our final recommendations on that project.


Also last night there was a meeting on the 19
th
 Avenue Transportation Study that I mentioned last week.  I was not at that one but there was apparently a small group that attended and I just want to announce for the commission and the public that we have extended the comment period on that study to March 12
th
.  


Both of the studies are available on line.  Just as a reminder, the 19
th
 Avenue Study is not a transportation study being done for an environmental review, but is being on at the request of Supervisor Elsbernd to look at the entire 19
th
 Avenue corridor and transportation impacts.  It is not an environmental review type of transportation study but will help to inform the environmental review for Park Merced and other projects in that corridor. 


A couple of hours ago, the Mayor and Supervisor Maxwell held a press conference at one of the new Pavement to Parks (the one at 16
th
 and 8
th
).  There was a very big crowd and I just want to give a shout out to Andres Power and the staff who have been a work horse on this.  He has personally not only engaged with designers; sought funding; but has been out there planting plants, and buying furniture, and watering plants, and making these things happen.  We now have three of these little plazas in place and we are working on 12 more that will be done this year.  Some of them will be done along commercial streets where we will be taking two or three parking spaces and turning them into small seating areas and planted areas adjacent to restaurants and cafes.  The next one to open will be on Divisadero within the month.


Finally, I just want to remind you that I will be away tomorrow and all of next week.  I will miss next weekâs meeting.  Larry will be in charge of the Department next week while Iâm away.  


Commissioner Antonini:


On the 19
th
 Avenue Study, I know I have received paperwork.  Are we going to have a hearing on that anytime?


Director Rahaim:


We are not scheduled to have a hearing, but if you think it would be appropriate we could do an informational hearing.


Commissioner Antonini:


I think it might be good to do if there is that feeling among the other commissioners and our calendar would permit it.  It is a fairly significant section of the city.  Letâs see.


My next question is on the Pavement to Parks, are we going to be allowed to put heat lamps there or wind buffers at certain times of the year when it might be appropriate?  That might add to the amount of people that use them.


Director Rahaim:


In some areas that might be a good idea.


Commissioner Moore:


Did we ever follow up on issuing a running calendar of what meetings are occurring?  I have attended every meeting of the northern waterfront but did not know about this one.  So Iâm sitting here in grave disbelief that I was not notified including anybody else who might want to attend.   I had helped the Department in one of the meetings, taking minutes, so I really assumed that somebody would copy me.  Iâm sitting here a little bit dumb faced not having been included in your mailing list.


Director Rahaim:


Iâm sorry.  You should have been on the mailing list.  I donât know why that happened.  On the Departmentâs home page there is now a calendar that is showing public events.  Itâs not completely all there yet, but we are working to make that happen.  You will be able to click on the event and then it will take you to the page that describes the project.  Again, I apologize for not being notified.  You should have been on the list.  There must have been some glitch on the list.
