950 Mason Street
 
â Fairmont Hotel Project
 - 
Certification 
of the Final Environmental Impact Report
 - The project site is located at 
950 Mason Street (Assessorâs Block 0244, Lot 001). The proposed project 
includes: 1) renovation of portions of the landmark 1906 Fairmont Hotel building 
(City Landmark # 185), including consolidation of up to 60 hotel rooms; 2) 
reconfiguration of some existing hotel uses; 3) demolition of the 1961 23-story 
Fairmont Hotel tower above the five-story podium; and 4) construction of a new 
160âunit, 26-story residential tower and five-story midrise residential 
component, both above a five-story podium, on the site of the existing hotel 
tower and podium (proposed to be demolished). The proposed project would include 
below-grade parking for about 350 vehicles.  The 113,400-square-foot project 
site is located in an RM-4 (Residential Mixed-High Density) Use District and the 
Nob Hill Special Use District (SUD), and in 200-E, 300-E and 320-E Height and 
Bulk Districts.  The proposed project would require Conditional Use (CU) 
authorization for height and bulk and for a Planned Unit Development (PUD) 
including exceptions to the 25 percent rear yard requirement, as well as require 
Planning Commission approval under the âLarge Tourist Hotel Conversion 
Ordinance,â Administrative Code 41F.3(f), among other approvals. The proposed 
exterior changes to the historic 1906 Fairmont Hotel building would also require 
a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Historic Preservation Commission. The 
Draft EIR found that implementation of the proposed project would result in a 
significant unavoidable environmental impact on cultural resources, related to 
demolition of the Tonga Room, which has been identified as a historic resource 
under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).







NOTE
:
  
The action for this item falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Planning 
Commission





Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the Final Environmental Impact Report.







Note: The public review period for the Draft Environmental Impact Report ended 
at 5:00 pm, June 16, 2010.  The Planning Commission does not conduct public 
review of Final EIRs. Public comments on the certification may be presented to 
the Planning Commission during the Public Comment portion of the Commission 
calendar.





 




SPEAKERS:     None





ACTION:           Following a failed motion to certify the Final EIR (+3 -3 with 
Commissioners Moore, Sugaya, and Olague voting against the motion), the item was 
continued to 1/27/2011 with the idea that the Commission will receive a memo 
(drafted by Mr. Wycko â Environmental Review Officer and Ms. Stacy â Deputy City 
Attorney) as to the appropriateness of additional analysis, and look at that at 
a later date; the maker of the motion would have the ability to ask for 
reconsideration.  If the item is to come before the Commission prior to the 
proposed 1/27/11 date, the item would have to be re-advertised for another date.





AYES:              Antonini, Borden, Sugaya and Miguel 





NAYES:            Moore and Olague
