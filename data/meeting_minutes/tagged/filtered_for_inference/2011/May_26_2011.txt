Commissioner Miguel:




During this week I met with people regarding 401 Grove, Pier 
70, 55 Laguna, and also with AT&T.  I would like to point out that the American 
Society of Landscape Architects, Northern California Chapter, has awarded the 
Mission District Streetscape Plan, their 2011 Merit Award. David Alumbaugh and 
their team should be congratulated.  In addition, this would not have happened 
in normal circumstances. The plan wouldn't have even started under normal 
circumstances, because this is the type of planning -- long-range planning 
basically that is normally funded through the General Fund and there literally 
isn't any General Fund.  This was because of the Department being able to secure 
grants to do the work. So the Department deserves -- accolades on both counts.




Commissioner Borden:




A couple of things: a little nitpicky thing about the 
website, when you go to the website it says click on this week's agendas and it 
takes you to all the different weeks. It would be easier if we can go directly 
to the agendas for that week. It's really annoying. That's how I check my 
agendas, because it usually changes. So that's number one. Number two: I know a 
member of the public is going to talk about this in public comment and it 
reminds me of last week. But I would love to have a conversation about the 
protocol for informing the D.R. Requestors, or people in opposition to a 
project, making sure that they know in a timely manner if they want to submit 
things when their deadline is and how many packets they need to provide and how 
much advance notice they can get. I understand that sometimes dates change and 
the Department's working primarily with the Project Sponsor. But to the extent 
possible, if we can get to people we know who have been vocal -- we're not 
saying that people have not identified themselves as being related to a project 
must be notified. But, at least for those people who have been identified to be 
interested in the project, to get notice about deadlines for submitting 
materials in particular, I think it would be very useful and would prevent 
continuances and a lot of strife that people feel their issues are not heard 
adequately. So that is my other thing. And finally: I think that in terms of the 
last item, I think it would be useful after our closed session to have an open 
session to talk about the issues, and I know that there's a hesitancy with legal 
opinions to release them broadly, because you don't want to release legal 
strategy. You want to protect the city against liability. But I think that in 
some cases we have to kind of come down on a position and let the public know - 
so the public knows how to react and behave and pursue other legal action if 
they want. But I think it's important that we -- that the public knows what the 
city's position is generally on the various laws that are passed down to the 
extent that it doesn't expose our legal strategy should we have to go to court.




Commissioner Antonini:






A meeting this week with leaders and residents in my office, 
and we talked about a couple of issues, one of which was a project which is on 
the calendar for today but has been continued, and that's 2055 Lombard. But 
also, a lengthy discussion about another project that will be coming before us 
in the future, it is my understanding, a bed-and-breakfast at Scott and Lombard, 
I think. I forget the cross street. It's another issue surrounding emancipated 
foster youth. But they raised a lot of very serious concerns that were different 
than was the case with earlier projects at 800 Presidio that we had heard. So I 
think this is something we have to look at very closely. I know it's on our 
calendar, I believe, but I will want to have some answers to some of these 
questions before we hear that.


Commissioner Sugaya
: 




On the website: for me I think it would be adequate if you 
just reversed the orders of the agendas and the years starting from 2011 and go 
down. But the agendas start in January and go down. So if you flipped it, it 
might be helpful.




President Olague
:




I also met with representatives of 55 Laguna this week and 
AT&T representatives as well. I met with some seniors from District 5, but 
mostly the Western Addition and it was really interesting. The issue of the 
census came up and the increasing number of seniors that are going to be here in 
San Francisco. So a lot of issues concerning their quality of life were raised. 
 I met with some youth from the South of Market also, who raised issues that 
they are concerned about as it relates to housing and other issues of low income 
and homeless youth. Finally: this morning I attended the preview, I guess, or 
presentation on the expansion of the MOMA, and that was really fun. So it's 
pretty exciting, really. And I guess we'll be hearing from them on the 23rd of 
June. So it's just kind of nice to have something really positive going on in 
the City, because sometimes when we're here we forget that there are really some 
amazing things that are going on. That happens to be one of them I think. So it 
was a good, positive presentation. So, it is something to look forward to.




Commissioner Borden
:




I did have one more question. I 
know that Supervisor Wiener is working on legislation dealing with the mobile 
food cart issue, moving it from the interior of the parks to a kind of like pad 
that's going to be built more on the exterior.  And I wanted to know if that 
would be something that would come to us or something that we would look at. 
Because I know -- if it's still part of the public space but then it's starting 
to get into the public realm, I wondered if it's something that we would look 
at, particularly because it has to do with -- also with our eating and drinking 
in the neighborhood and all this other stuff.




 


D.         DIRECTORâS REPORT




 




9.         Directorâs 
Announcements




 




Director Rahaim:




Last night was the community meeting on the Showplace Square 
Historic Survey. There were, I think, maybe 25 people in attendance. We had a 
somewhat lively discussion that is scheduled to go to the Historic Preservation 
meeting next week at their June 1 meeting for their consideration of adoption of 
that survey. Two days ago there was the second of two meetings on the Better 
Market Street Project. This one was at the Whitcomb Hotel under the Department 
of Public Works.  We are working very closely with them to redesign Market 
Street. There were about 100 people in attendance at this meeting. It was a good 
crowd, a good discussion, and that project is completing its first phase, which 
is a kind of analysis of existing conditions and looking at best practices of 
other cities. The next couple of months we'll move into the phase of ideas for 
the future of Market Street, and I also wanted to let you know that I convened a 
meeting this week. I think I mentioned last time with the wireless providers as 
well as the City's Department of Technology, the City Attorney's Office and 
staff about this issue of the wireless facilities and the possibility or the 
potential of looking at some sort of larger plan or context for those 
facilities. We had a good discussion. We're pulling together some notes and some 
ideas from that meeting, and I will reconvene that group in a few weeks to talk 
about what we think we could be doing in that regard, and what a potential plan 
might look like; might cost; what the scope of that might be.  And I just wanted 
to also thank Commissioner Miguel for his comments about the Mission Streetscape 
Plan. You're right, that plan would not have been possible without grants, 
because those types of projects are no longer funded through the City's General 
Fund, and so I appreciate your comments.  And I want to congratulate staff for 
winning the third award in the last month on our project. We're really pleased 
about that.




            




10.        Review of Past 
Weekâs Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals, and Historic 
Preservation Commission.




 




BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:




§
        

BF various Parkmerced. 


The Land Use Committee held a special hearing on the morning 
of Tuesday May 24 to consider Parkmerced. At that hearing Board President David 
Chiu introduced a package of amendments to the Development Agreement intended to 
strengthen the tenant and rent control protections in the agreement. The 
highlights include: 




o
       

providing that 
tenants themselves become 3rd Party beneficiaries of the agreement and are 
explicitly vested in the agreement and given rights to bring legal action over 
enforcement of the agreement (as opposed to just the City);




o
       

instituting an 
explicit financial penalty, equal to approximately $192million, if the developer 
challenges the rent control provisions in court, whose proceeds would be used to 
subsidize the rents of relocated tenants; 




o
       

designating 
certain blocks of existing garden apartments to remain until the last phase of 
development or 20 years, whichever is sooner, and allow existing tenants with 
tenure of over 10 years to move to these units if they wish; 




o
       

requiring the 
Developer to allow a group of relocating tenants to collectively move to the 
same block of new housing if they wish to stay together; and




o
       

inserting the 
explicit ability of tenants to petition the Rent Board for a rent reduction for 
loss of patio or balcony space in a new replacement unit.  




o
       

An amendment to 
the Design Standards + Guidelines document was also adopted that would eliminate 
the organic farm and replace it with additional sports fields. These amendments 
were all adopted, and the Committee forwarded all of the items to the Full Board 
without recommendation by a vote of 2-1 (Wiener and Cohen support, Mar opposed).





The same afternoon, the Full 
Board voted to uphold certification of the EIR and on first reading to approve 
all actions on the project by a vote of 6-5. In favor were Chiu, Chu, Cohen, 
Elsbernd, Ferrell, and Wiener. Opposed were Avalos, Campos, Kim, Mar, and 
Mirakrimi. The project will go before the MTA Board and PUC Commission in June 
for those agencies to ratify their respective portions of the Development 
Agreement.




§
        

AT&T Lightspeed Appeal.
  
This item was continued without discussion at the request of Supervisor Wiener. 

The Board approved a five-week continuance.
  Also at the hearing, 
Supervisor Wiener introduced a hearing request on DPWâs Order governing 
Excavation Permits for the Installation of Surface-Mounted Facilities in the 
Public Rights-of-Way.  Specifically, the supervisor requested âa discussion with 
Public Works, City Planning, SFMTA and the PUC of the extent to which the DPW 
Order conforms with the General Plan and the Better Streets Planâ.




§
        

1787 Union St.
  
This appeal concerned the Cat Ex for âThe Brickyardâ. Neighbors alleged that a 
cat ex should not have been issued due to a potentially significant impact from 
sound at the premises.  Further, they alleged that Department staff and the 
Commission had acknowledged the impact by using certain CEQA terms during the DR 
review.  The appellants specifically cited the use of âimpactâ and 
âmitigationsâ.  At the hearing, the Department countered that two sound readings 
by an Entertainment Commission Inspector demonstrated that there was no 
significant impact from the project. Countering the appellantâs argument that 
the conditions to address sound were âmitigationsâ under CEQA, the Department 
demonstrated that the Commission was, in fact, applying conditions above and 
beyond CEQA to address concerns over sound.  
The Board
 
agreed and 
upheld the Cat Ex unanimously.




 INTRODUCTIONS:  




            The hearing request from Supervisor Wiener was 
the only introduction of note this week.




BOARD OF APPEALS:




There was no hearing by the 
Board of Appeals last week.

 - 
Appeal of 
Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration -
 The proposed project would 
demolish the existing service station, now used for surface parking, and would 
construct an approximately 50,000-square-foot (sq-ft), five-story, 52 
1/3-foot-high residential building containing 18 3-bedroom dwelling units, with 
7,100 sq ft of ground-floor retail space. The proposed building would have a 
below-grade parking garage accessible from 20
th
 Street with 14 
residential and four retail off-street parking spaces. The 10,925-sq ft project 
site (Assessorâs Block 3596, Lot 113) is within the Valencia Street Neighborhood 
Commercial Transit (NCT) zoning district and a 55-X height and bulk district on 
the block bounded by Valencia Street to the west, 19
th
 Street to the 
north, Mission Street to the west, and 20
th
