Board of Appeals:
 




The Board of 
Appeals heard one item that would be of interest to the Commission - 1787 Union 
Street (dba The Brickhouse).  The subject project (outdoor patio front of a 
restaurant) was before the Planning Commission as a DR on January 20, 2011.  At 
this hearing the Commission unanimously approved the project with conditions, 
including limitations on seating, hours of operation and the number of doors 
that could remain open to the outdoor seating area.  The Board of Appeals heard 
the matter and believed that additional measures could be adopted to address 
neighbor concerns regarding noise.  The Board voted to continue the item to 
August 10, 2011, and directed the Permit Holder to investigate alternative 
methods for addressing the noise issues (including, but not limited to, changing 
the operation of the doors to the patio).
