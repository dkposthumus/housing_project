Japantown Community Planning Process and Initial recommendations
 - 
Informational Presentation - 
Since the August 2009 Japantown BNP presentation and 2010 information update made to the Planning Commission, significant and important progress has been made in the review and development of proposed amendments to the original DRAFT Japantown BNP (2009). The community representatives participating in this review process are committed to a comprehensive review and generating public support for their recommended revisions to the original neighborhood plan. The community, through formal votes and authorizations from the Japantown Organizing Committee, is currently prepared to share their initial review and recommendations with the Planning Commission and the general public. These community recommendations represent numerous significant departures from the recommendations in the initial 2009 Draft Japantown BNP Plan.
