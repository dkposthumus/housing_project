Treasure Island/Yerba Buena Island Redevelopment Project
 
- 
Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report
 The Treasure 
Island Development Authority (TIDA) is proposing a 
Redevelopment Plan for the 
Treasure Island/Yerba Buena Island Project
 that would provide the basis for 
redevelopment of portions of Naval Station Treasure Island. The project site is 
located on Treasure Island and Yerba Buena Island and the immediately 
surrounding waters (Assessors Block 1939, Lots 1 and 2). The proposed project 
would include development on Treasure Island and Yerba Buena Island of up to 
8,000 residential units; up to 140,000 square feet (sq. ft.) of new commercial 
and retail space; up to 100,000 sq. ft. of new office space; adaptive reuse of 
three historic buildings on Treasure Island with up to 311,000 sq. ft. of 
commercial, retail, and/or flex space; about 500 hotel rooms; rehabilitation of 
the historic buildings on Yerba Buena Island; new and/or upgraded public and 
community facilities; new and/or upgraded public utilities; about 300 acres of 
parks and public open space including shoreline access and cultural uses such as 
a museum; new and upgraded streets and public ways; bicycle, transit, and 
pedestrian facilities; landside and waterside facilities for the Treasure Island 
Sailing Center; landside services for an expanded marina; and a new Ferry 
Terminal and intermodal Transit Hub.  Infrastructure improvements would include 
geotechnical stabilization to improve seismic safety.  The proposed project 
would also include green building specifications, programs to encourage transit 
use, design standards that would enable photovoltaic panel installation on most 
roofs, recycled water use, and other features promoting 
sustainability. Construction and build-out would be phased and would be 
anticipated to occur over an approximately 15- to 20-year period. The proposed 
project would require amendments to the San Francisco Planning Code and the 

San Francisco General Plan.
  The Draft EIR identifies potentially 
significant, unavoidable environmental impacts on aesthetics, historic 
architectural resources, transportation, noise, air quality, wind and biological 
resources. 





Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the Final EIR

899 Valencia Street
 - 

Appeal of Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration -
 The proposed project 
would demolish the existing service station, now used for surface parking, and 
would construct an approximately 50,000-square-foot (sq-ft), five-story, 52 
1/3-foot-high residential building containing 18 3-bedroom dwelling units, with 
7,100 sq ft of ground-floor retail space. The proposed building would have a 
below-grade parking garage accessible from 20
th
 Street with 14 
residential and four retail off-street parking spaces. The 10,925-sq ft project 
site (Assessorâs Block 3596, Lot 113) is within the Valencia Street Neighborhood 
Commercial Transit (NCT) zoning district and a 55-X height and bulk district on 
the block bounded by Valencia Street to the west, 19
th
 Street to the 
north, Mission Street to the west, and 20
th
 Street to the south, at 
the northeast corner of Valencia and 20th Streets in the Mission District 
neighborhood. The proposed project would require a conditional use authorization 
for development of a parcel exceeding 10,000 sq ft, for a non-residential use in 
excess of 3,000 sq ft, and to allow for permanent conversion of a service 
station to a new use.

EXECUTIVE PARK â 
INFORMATIONAL HEARING
 - The 71-acre Executive Park Subarea Plan Area is located in the 
southeastern part of San Francisco, just east of U.S. Highway 101 and along the 
San Francisco/San Mateo County border. It is generally bounded by Highway 101 to 
the west, Bayview Hill to the North, Jamestown Avenue  to the east(but not those 
lots fronting on Jamestown), and Harney Way to the south.  
  
The proposed 
Executive Park General Plan, Planning Code Text and Map Amendments and the 
proposed Design Guidelines would provide for the transition of the existing 
office park portion of the site to a new mixed-use predominately residential, 
pedestrian oriented neighborhood.  These amendments would accommodate up to 
1,600 dwelling units, approximately 70,000 gross square feet of retail, 
approximately 2,425 off-street parking spaces and other associated uses, in 
approximately thirteen buildings that would range between 65-feet to 240-feet 
tall.  
This second informational hearing on the Executive Park Amendments 
will focus on the proposed zoning amendments (both text and map amendments) and 
the proposed Executive Park Design Guidelines.

AMENDMENTS
 - 
The 71-acre Executive Park 
Subarea Plan Area is located in the southeastern part of San Francisco, just 
east of U.S. Highway 101 and along the San Francisco/San Mateo County border. It 
is generally bounded by Highway 101 to the west, Bayview Hill to the North,

Request to


Initiate Amendments to the Executive Park Subarea Plan of the Bayview 
Hunters Point Area Plan of the General Plan, the Land Use Index and other minor 
General Plan Map and Figures, pursuant to Planning Code Section 340(c).  


The amended Subarea Plan would establish objectives 
and policies to transform Executive Park from a partial office park to a 
mixed-use, predominately residential, pedestrian-oriented neighborhood; and 
would provide objectives and policies to guide land use, streets and 
transportation, urban design, community facilities and services, and recreation 
and open space issues.  The amended Subarea Plan would also establish a new 
publicly accessible street grid and open space network.  The land Use Index and 
various maps and figures throughout the General Plan would also be amended to 
reflect the Subarea Plan changes.  These amendments along with proposed Planning 
Code Text Changes, Zoning Map Changes and the establishment of Design Guidelines 
would accommodate up to 1,600 dwelling units, approximately 70,000 gross square 
feet of retail, approximately 2,425 off-street parking spaces, and other 
associated uses, in approximately thirteen buildings that would range between 
65-feet to 240-feet tall.

EXECUTIVE PARK â 
INITIATION OF PLANNING CODE TEXT AMENDMENTS
 
- 
The 71-acre Executive Park Subarea Plan Area is 
located in the southeastern part of San Francisco, just east of U.S. Highway 101 
and along the San Francisco/San Mateo County border. It is generally bounded by 
Highway 101 to the west, Bayview Hill to the North, Jamestown Avenue to the east 
(but not including those lots fronting on Jamestown), and Harney Way to the 
south.  Parcels that would be affected by the Planning Code Text and Map Changes 
are bordered by Executive Park Boulevards West, North, and East on the west, 
north, and east respectively and Harney Way on the south (also referred to as 
the office park portion).  
Request to Initiate Amendments to the San 
Francisco Planning Code that would add Section 249.54 to establish the Executive 
Park Special Use District; add Section 263.27 to establish Special Height 
Provisions for the Executive Park Special Use District and the 65/240 EP Height 
and Bulk District; and amend Table 270 to provide that the Table is not 
applicable, pursuant to Planning Code Section 302(b).
  The new Executive 
Park Special Use District (SUD) would create special provisions for buildings 
within the office park portion of the site that would, among other things, allow 
for density transfers across the site, and include requirements for street and 
open space improvements.  The new height and bulk provisions would generally 
allow buildings between 65-feet and 85-feet along with three towers between the 
heights of 170 to 240 feet.  The design review provisions would require review 
by the Planning Commission of all new development projects.   These amendments 
along with proposed changes to General Plan Amendments Zoning Maps and the 
proposed establishment of Design Guidelines, would  provide for the transition 
of the existing office park portion of the site to a new mixed-use predominately 
residential, pedestrian oriented neighborhood.  These amendments would 
accommodate up to 1,600 dwelling units, approximately 70,000 gross square feet 
of retail, approximately 2,425 off-street parking spaces and other associated 
uses, in approximately thirteen buildings that would range between 65-feet to 
240-feet tall.
