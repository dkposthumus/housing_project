Planning Commission.




 




Commissioner Moore:




I want to briefly share with you an observation I made 
yesterday afternoon driving down Divisadero Street - it looks fabulous, 
particularly on the west side. The Harding Theater, which was spent a lot of 
time on, is the most disappointing and abominable thing I have seen. In addition 
to a padlock, which we actually deemed inefficient because it caught the 
vandalism at the time, had graffiti all over it and has a for sale sign. We 
approved this project. It was a lot of work. There were specific implications.





Commissioner Olague:




 At the time, when we did this we did not certify the 
environmental impact report. We never got to the project, so there was never a 
project approved. We never certified the EIR. There was some talk that the 
neighbors would work with the supervisors and developers, to look at other 
potential ideas for the site â like continuing the theatre use.


Commissioner Moore:




Thank you for reminding me, nothing developed from that. If 
there was a not an approved EIR, the owners still cannot leave their property in 
the condition it is and it really

detracts from this evolving neighborhood. I find it really sad that we do not 
have an ability to do something about it.




Commissioner Sugaya:




Does this not follow under Supervisor Chu' s legislation on 
deteriorating or abandoned properties?




Commissioner Olague:




I think Supervisor Chu' s legislation requires vacant 
properties to be registered, requires certain minimal maintenance. We can look 
at that. 




Director Rahaim:




Just to clarify -- what you did was to uphold the appeal, 
that is right. Commissioner Moore:




Commissioner Moore:




If the City Attorney is taking note on this one, in the next 
block, going north, there is an abandoned, boarded up liquor store in the middle 
of the block also, which is also full of graffiti. Two properties, which just 
make it really so hard.




Commissioner Olague




 We cannot engage in conversation, obviously, but it would be 
great if the Department could give us the status of that. You are right, we 
spend hours here deliberating.




 




 




Commissioner Borden.




I want to commend the staff on the upgrades to the Commission 
website. I did want to point out a couple of things that needed to be improved 
upon. First of all, the time of the meeting still says 1:30 p.m., it needs to be 
change to 12:00 p.m. The role of the Planning Commission, there is generic 
language that must be used in other cities, because referred about advising the 
City Council, which we do not have. That language needs to be updated. The other 
thing is when you click on Planning Commission meetings, you go on a loop and 
see Linda' s name, her phone number, and that takes you back to the website with 
the contact information. It does not let you click through the agenda. Just 
making it more usable would be more helpful.


Commissioner Miguel:




I would like to commend the Department on earning the APA 
Northern California award for the Better Streets Plan. I thought that was 
excellent and a number of things that have engaged in planning, this week, so it 
seems, I have been involved in the San Francisco Presidio.

At a meeting last Friday, there was discussion on the impact of the Presidio -- 
the impact of the America's Cup on the Presidio. Part of it evolved into a 
discussion of the extension of the F line into the Presidio area, as well as 
impacting the National Maritime Museum, which is a separate National Park 
Service Agency. That was interesting because that conversation stated they are 
going to try to rush ahead as fast as possible and not have their construction 
impact America's Cup. However, at a SPUR meeting this week, when the America's 
Cup came up, the statement was made, there is no way they are going to do it 
because it will impact America's Cup, so it will happen later, so someone needs 
to get their comments together on this. I think it is very much in -- up in the 
air. I am hearing from various people who are supposedly authoritative, in the 
know, for that. 




Monday, I attended the meeting, here in City Hall, at the 
Board of Supervisors Land Use Committee, the hearing called by Supervisor, Scott 
Wiener, regarding the HPC Preservation survey, among other things. The Director 
spoke, and number of Department heads.  I thought it was a very good meeting. I 
did leave before all of the public, or I probably would have been there for 
another three hours, at least. Obviously, the item is continued, but I think it 
aired a number of questions people had, and number of viewpoints people had 
regarding that. The Safeway at La Playa has been under planning for four years, 
re-construction, enlargement by a 50%.They have a huge lot. The Planning 
Department told them that they are going to not let them go ahead unless they 
incorporate housing.




I was able to see the now fourth iteration, 3rd architect and 
this one seems to be getting it right. They are doing a tremendous amount of 
interactive work with the neighborhood, and that works well for the project.  It 
is just very interesting to see how a major business organization can actually 
interact with the neighborhood, also out in that neighborhood, and the Veterans 
Administration Medical Center at 42
nd
 Avenue and Clement Street,  is 
planning to possibly double its size on something of a postage stamp campus 
there by their own records, there are over 300 cars parked. They are 
theoretically moving to Mission Bay, all or part of their operations. The 
expansion is hardly anything to do with patient care for veterans.  It is all 
UCSF research, which is seemingly their primary mission at the moment, although 
not on paper .Here you have a federal organization without any rapport with the 
community whatsoever,  in fact, the community has filed suit against them, for 
non-compliance with NEPA, and could possibly the very second legal action in 
order to get some reaction from them. 




The Housing Action Coalition have their housing forum 
yesterday morning. It was, as usual, an excellent forum. The Chief Economist for 
San Francisco participated this was one of the more, say, active, interactive 
discussions we have had regarding public housing, low income housing.  I thought 
it was particularly well done.  A lot of interesting statistics were brought up 
everything from the financing on down .I already mentioned the SPUR meeting on 
Fisherman's Wharf.  Commissioner Fong was there. That went really well.  I had a 
conversation with Assembly Member Kathleen from Merced, she wrote the 
legislation on high-speed rail, the Director' s name came up several times as 
the head of the cooperative work the city has been pursuing for some time, the 
problems of 16
th
 Street, getting through, underground, not 
underground. To me, it somewhat resembles the problem San Francisco has had from 
time to time with Caltrans, whose objective is to move as much traffic as fast 
as possible, sometimes regardless of the impact of the municipalities they go 
through. San Francisco has, in recent years, a good record with Caltrans. They 
have worked with the City to lessen the impact hopefully, high-speed rail, they 
will be able to do so also. The friends of City Planning they there was also 
last night. If I am not mistaken, the website, the ability to search the web 
site came from some of their grants.




Commissioner Antonini:




 I read I was not able to attend the Housing Coalition action 
forum. I understand it was very good.




I was able to briefly attend the Friends of City Planning. As 
always, it is a nice event. Other meetings in the last week-- I met with 
representatives, who I believe -- the project have been continued for a few 
weeks now.  Also meetings between representatives for the Academy of Art 
University, property owner in Mid-Market, this was very informative. I also met 
with some neighbors who were concerned with a project that was on our 
continuance calendar, 70 Gold Mine Drive, and representatives from California 
Medical Center. Those were my meetings. 
Commissioner Sugaya:




I just want to comment on high-speed rail San Francisco to 
San Jose, it is very contentious, I think, along the Peninsula having grown up 
down there, I can understand the resident' s concern about high speed coming 
through their area. I can remember when I was a kid, we used to go to the 
bridge, we stood time it so that the 9:45 commuter train -- we would wait at the 
crossing. The timing was always perfect. Any way, I did not go to the Friends of 
City Planning because I was attending another reception. This one was pulled 
together by Frank Fong at the Board of Appeals in honor of Mr. Cornfield who 
have been transferred to the City Attorney's Office to work on seismic safety 
standards in the City, or something along those lines. So he will no longer be 
representing the Building Department at the Board of Appeals. We did have staff 
defect from the friends meeting come to our perception. Their names will not be 
mentioned here. I did also attend, along with Commissioner Miguel and Director 
Rahaim, the Supervisorsâ hearing on Historic Preservation. I did stay till the 
very end, I think the second to the last speaker. I did offer some suggestions 
directly to the Supervisor. I will be following up with that myself.

Lastly, in the business section, there was mention of a study that was done 
which places San Francisco in the top five cities of opportunity. If you go to 
the website, it is www.Puc.Gov, I think, there is an extensive amount of 
information at their, I think. That people analyzed to see why the San Francisco 
rating is so high. I think a lot of people were surprised but like all rating 
systems, they are ultimately suspect.




Commission Olague: 






A couple weeks ago, I asked for a report -- there was a 
study, that the study the migration within the City. I still love not seen a 
copy of that. I would like to receive a copy of that. I would like to discuss, 
at some point, we mentioned a few possible topics for discussion up here. But 
commissioners and members of the public of course at these meetings, it would be 
nice if they look at the calendar and start scheduling some of those policy 
discussions that have to do with parking and tourism and all of these other 
topics. Hopefully -- maybe in July we can start calendaring at least once a 
month. Well, that is it.




 


D.         DIRECTORâS REPORT




 




8.         Directorâs 
Announcements




 




Director Rahaim:




We received a second award for the Shipyard Plan.  That is 
one of the times we have seen the Environmental Impact Report receive such an 
award. I was very pleased with that award. I did want to mention the website. We 
are very pleased with the website. It was actually funded by the Planning, 
allowing us to hire temporary staffers. The glitch was partially due to a 
miscommunication with the City will of the website before we were ready and so, 
we had to make some final changes. We were able to correct the glitches. As we 
speak right now, there is a hearing on the High-Speed Rail Authority in 
Sacramento, and several cities that are there. One of the issues being discussed 
is what they call the initial operating segments. I think we have been urging 
high-speed rail to think for some time about the San Jose to San Francisco 
corridor, such that you would only need two tracks instead of four. It is clear 
from the study that four tracks are not needed for a number of years. It 
probably helps us in these discussions with the communities along the Peninsula 
who are understandably, concerned about this.  There is city staff today at 
these hearings to testify in support of having that first segment. That piece of 
the whole system we have been working closely on. I think it has been a good 
introduction departmental effort, so, I am very hopeful we can make progress on 
this. One of the things that is interesting is the discussion that we had. If 
you look at the long-term picture of the growth of the State, it really comes 
down to what type of transportation system we would need to employ in 20 or 30 
years down the road to accommodate the growth? If you compare a high-speed rail 
to other means such as expanding airports or highways - I think it is an 
interesting way to frame the discussion. That really is the choice. Expanding 
airports and highways is not palatable to a lot of people. It is an interesting 
discussion.  I think we should have a broader, long-term policy. Finally, I just 
wanted to mention with respect to the preservation hearing on Monday, I thank 
the Commissioners for attending. I think it went on for about four hours. We 
stayed within an hour and a half and we will follow up with the supervisor on 
this. I spoke with the Commission about this yesterday, the idea that I had 
proposed a while ago of a summit discussion on preservation issues. I would 
still like to pursue that. I would just offer to the Commissioners, not 
necessarily today, but to give feedback on how that should be structured and how 
we move forward. I am going to approach a couple of sources for funding such an 
event and we will let you know how that goes.  I think that is it for me unless 
there are any questions.

Historic Preservation.   
At the request of Supervisor Scott Weiner, the land use 
committee held a hearing to consider the impact of historic preservation 
policies on public policy goals.  Staff led the Board Members and the public 
through a presentation that outlined where in the Planning Code and the General 
Plan Historic Preservation is regulated at the local level, as well as the 
Planning Departmentâs policies and requirements under CEQA.  In addition to 
Planning staff, other city departments that presented included the Libraries, 
MTA, Recreation and Parks, and the Mayorâs Office of Housing.  The local 
non-profit San Francisco Architectural Heritage was also on-hand to present to 
the members of the Board.  There was a large turnout and extensive public 
comment by the public on both sides of the issue.  Members of the Board of 
Supervisors asked Planning Staff for information on a wide range of issues, 
including the ethnic and cultural diversity of staff and consultants working on 
historic resource surveys, the number of historic context statements devoted to 
cultural and ethnic histories, and process questions related to CEQA and 
surveys.
  The informational hearing was continued to the call of the chair.
