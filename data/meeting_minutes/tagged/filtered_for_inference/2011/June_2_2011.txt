Commissioner Moore
:




I wanted to show you an 
exciting e-mail. The Administrator for the Region Nine EPA sent out an e-mail 
yesterday to his staff.  GSA has decided to refurbish the Herman plaza into a 
platinum building. They are building a new high-rise, of which we definitely 
need many, in downtown. However, they will basically upgrade the building in 
place in the process of doing it. This is really, really good news.  Because at 
a time when we are concerned that green buildings are not necessarily evolving, 
tear them down, but reinvent them from the inside out. This is very good news. I 
will be happy to share the details with you and forwarded the e-mail to you. I 
think this is a good example of what is doable with contemporary high-rises that 
are 10 or 15 years old but definitely can be refurbished. These are 
platinum-rated buildings.




There are five bills this 
week in Sacramento â two sponsors by former Supervisors Amiano and Leno, they 
are both dealing with winter protection of various kinds. SB184-Leno: 
establishing the ability of cities to enforce inclusionary housing law that 
would require affordable rental housing. This is something very important in 
light of the fact that we're struggling with this issue and there is not clearer 
guidance on how we should proceed in the next few months, and there is 
AB265âAmiano: saving tenants from eviction â until recently, someone could be 
evicted if they paid their rent 24 to 36 hours late, a reasonable time frame. 
 This is the protection for renters.  There are a couple of others, but those in 
particular are worthwhile noting.





Commissioner Miguel:






During last week, I met 
with some people regarding the Presidio, as well as a couple of nonprofits, a 
senior housing and assisted living, and some of the financial problems they are 
incurring presently because of HUD, Medical and Medicare, it is starting to hurt 
them quite badly. I had the pleasure of seeing the Salesforce model featured in 
the paper this morning. It is an excellent model if people get a chance to look 
at it. It puts things in perspective. As we know, projects change as they go 
along, it seems like an interesting beginning.




Commissioner Sugaya
:





Last night, I had the 
pleasure of attending a Japantown planning meeting, the first of four meetings 
that they are holding this summer.  Director Rahaim was there as well as Paul 
Lord, and Supervisor Mirkarimi.  The format was to go through three or four 
topical areas and they are broken up into separate groups, and each group got to 
spend 20 or 30 minutes addressing each topic. They will be compiling that input 
from last night.  At the next meeting, and the meeting after that, they will be 
moving on to three other topics, and the last one will be a summary of all the 
input they have gathered, and I think -- I do not remember -- they will have 
forthcoming recommendations for what the plan should have and that will be later 
in the year, I believe.

Directorâs Announcements




 




Director Rahaim:




I do not have much to 
report. I was going to give the same report that Commissioner Sugaya did on the 
Japantown meeting. 

We will be looking at what type of environmental review will be needed for 
planning, and if the plan does not come forward with major zoning changes, we 
are hoping we will be able to do something less than a full blown EIR.

The Commission will consider an Ordinance introduced by Supervisor Campos

requirement that the proposed historic sign be located within a historic sign 
district; and (2) allow signs that contribute to the visual identity and 
historic character of a City neighborhood in addition to the City as a whole.
