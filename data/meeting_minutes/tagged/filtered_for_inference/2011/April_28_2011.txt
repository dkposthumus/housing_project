Commissioner Antonini
: 




I went to Denver last 
week. We often hear about learning from European cities about things to do in 
San Francisco. We can also learn from American cities. For one thing, this is a 
City and County. This is a little bit less dense. The population is about 
600,000. 60 square miles of this is the airport and the law means that they have 
to include their airport in this City and the County.




The other interesting 
thing is that they have district supervisors and the column city council 
members. They have 11 districts, with a total of 13 and two at large. They have 
had it this way for 30 years. It is interesting that the number came out to be 
11 or the district. The parking controls are minimal compared to the ones that 
we have, and we are obliged to put in residential parking. They want to minimize 
the surface parking lots, to put this underground or in a less visible location, 
but there is little traffic relative to San Francisco. There are many factors 
but one of them is that you can drive very easily without going through Denver, 
which is a little more difficult in San Francisco. It is noticeably clean as far 
as the streets. You do not see any graffiti and they are doing things right in 
that regard. I did spend a couple of days .I wanted to thank the Director that I 
spoke to at length, and I have a conversation with Steven Gordon, the 
Comprehensive Planning Manager for the City and County of Denver, the equivalent 
of the Planning Commission. We did see some homes that were for sale. There was 
this huge house that was eight hundred thousand dollars, and I do not know what 
the average sale price is. There are many factors you can convert your property 
from rental to an ownership at will, and there is no rent control. By will do 
more research on what is happening in Denver. We will find out what they' re 
doing right and try to learn from this, as a list of things that they are doing 
right that they could learn from us.





Commissioner Sugaya:




It has been a long time 
since we've heard a status report on Japantown planning. I had a meeting last 
week and this is up to the staff. I think that we will calendar something in the 
future. I do not know when this will be communicated to staff. They may want to 
bring something forward.  I would like ask to calendar something in the future.






Commissioner Miguel:




On the 20th, I attended 
the Inner Mission North Historic Resources Survey meeting, and this was 
interesting for a number of reasons. There were several staff members there, 
making presentations, with several tables of various sections within the survey. 
So it could explain these explicitly to those in attendance. This was on the 
staff of one of the Supervisors. I was there with three members of the public. 
They were holding another on Saturday, one member of the public asked three 
questions, and then we left. I will compliment the staff on one of the best 
presentations on historic survey, and I have been in a number of these public 
meetings. This is by far the best that I have seen. It was concise, the power 
slides were well done, showing the mapping and the examples it is a shame that 
this was wasted on a lack of public participation. In addition to that, I had 
discussions with people during the past week, on Hyde St. and Parkmerced and 
then an item that had been before us, one year ago or so, the extension of the 
Drew School, in California St., there was a dedication of the new extension, and 
the green wall is by far the best example he still had to throw in a lot, but 
this is the best example I have seen in San Francisco, I seen few elsewhere this 
is the best that I have seen, the assembly building works, and it was just nice 
to see something that you have reviewed and finding this come to fruition.





Commissioner Miguel:




I did have an appointment 
with AT&T last week I found it very informative and I know this Commission is 
bee concern about the wireless antennas and the master plan for these companies 
with the kind of hardware that is out there, what needs to happen, and let 
thought was most interesting, is that the handsets have exceeded the antenna 
technology. There is the need to upgrade its equipment throughout the City to 
get coverage. I would recommend taking this appointment as well.





Commissioner Fong:




 I attended the Monday 
evening dedication ______ -- and this was amazing, to really see the theater for 
the first time, with students performing and I saw this off-Broadway in New 
York. This was so amazing. This is fostering creativity in teaching, and I think 
everyone should go to performance. This looks like the most beautiful wildflower 
meadow and I am proud we helped to bring this along. 





Commissioner Antonini:




I did have a meeting with 
the neighbors I think this is 1945 Hyde Street. This was a very interesting 
meeting with them last night. This is one of the homes approximating the 
property and I also attended the Drew School I was a little bit late. I was 
there but I was missing the meeting that was scheduled for the Planning 
Commissioners and others involved in the project. They had the prospective 
parents night, and this was 30 years too late. I like what they did their and 
this is very nice.





Commissioner Olague:




I wanted to ask staff a 
status on the eagle. I have an e-mail from members of the public and I think 
that this is an issue that the Historic Preservation Commission is looking at, 
and I would like some kind of a status, not that this is something that will 
come before us. But they were looking at a possible cultural status or 
something. Also, somebody asked me about, maybe this is something for another 
day. I know that Austin, Texas, there is a street dedicated tonight music and 
entertainment, Sixth Street. Years ago, there was a conversation starting with 
the 11
th
 Street and establishing something similar there. This is 
something I wanted to explore a little bit more. It seems to me that it would be 
good to have a street, or something that is safe or nighttime use and 
entertainment. Also, I spoke earlier today with Mario Yedidia of the Youth 
commission. At some time, there would like to request a joint hearing, the talk 
about this issue, the experiences in terms of housing and other issues. This is 
something that the commissioners would look at. We have talked about family 
before here, and this is an issue that maybe we do not focus enough. This is 
something for July or August. 




Commissioner Borden
:





I wanted to support 
Commissioners Olague's request for the late night idea as well as the hearing on 
families.





Commissioner Antonini:




The late night idea 
whether could be at 11
th
 or other place, like the Gas Lamp in San 
Diego, these are almost entirely entertainment, but it would be wonderful to 
have something like this.




 


D.         DIRECTORâS REPORT

Directorâs Announcements




           






Kelley Amdur:





The Director is out of town this week, attending a conference in New York City. 
I do not have too many announcements. I will remind everyone that the 
Department's staff is preparing the final edits to the presentation that we will 
be making before the Land Use Committee on Monday starting at 1:00 pm.  
Supervisor Weiner had an issue for this meeting to discuss historic preservation 
issues and we have worked with their office throughout the week to prepare a 
presentation for that.  In regard to Eagle â the Historic Preservation 
Commission calendared an item for the project the first hearing in June. Maybe 
Linda Avery, Commission Secretary you could help me with the exact date. 
Specifically to clarify for the public, the aspects of the project related to 
preservation.

The Land Use Committeeâs informational hearings on Treasure Island and Yerba 
Buena Island and Parmerced continued this week.

BF 110298 Parkmerced.  
Last week the hearing at 
the Land Use Committee focused on transporationa, urban design, open space, and 
sustainability.  Staff led the Board Members and the public through an ambitious 
100 slide presentation.  A good deal of the discussion centered on whether 
rent-control would remain in effect for future residents.  Staff from the Office 
of Workforce and Economic Development stated that they believe the City has a 
strong contractual development agreement to ensure there are enforceable 
provisions for rent-control that could be upheld in a court of law, emphasizing 
that no one from the office or the City Attorneyâs office can guarantee the 
future.  
The hearing was continued without action.  The Commission will 
consider action on the Parkmerced ordinances on or after May 16

 Staff provided a 
slide show generally encompassing the same material presented to Commissioners 
at their last two info hearing.  Staff discussed the history of the area, the 
proposed amendments to the Executive Park Subarea Plan, new zoning and the 
establishment of design guidelines.  Public comment to the Committee members was 
generally favorable.  
The Committee continued the item as the call of the 
chair.

110147 Mission Streetscape Plan. 



 This item is a General Plan Amendment of the Mission Area Plan to reflect the 
Commissionâs adoption of the Mission Streetscape Plan.  On January 20, 2011 the 
Commission adopted the Plan and adopted a resolution to amend the General Plan 
with this Ordinance.  While no Board action was required for the adoption of the 
Streetscape Plan itself, the Board does need to adopt the Ordinance to amend the 
General Plan.  
Last week the Board passed the Plan on Final Reading.

CEQA Cat Ex Appeal of AT&Tâs Lightspeed Project â 


This case involved appeal 
of the Departmentâs Cat Ex for 726 utility cabinets to be located in the public 
right-of-way for improved internet and new television services.  SF Beautiful 
and the Planning Assn. of the Richmond were the appellants.  They claimed the 
project did not fit within the definition of a Class 3 exemption and that it 
requires an EIR.  The appellants claimed the project would trigger exceptions 
because it there are âunusual circumstancesâ that would result in significant 
aesthetic, pedestrian, and cumulative impacts.







      


The Department responded 
that these claims were not valid because the Class 3 allows the installation of 
small new equipment and facilities in small structures â which is not limited in 
number.  Also, the cabinets would be installed in the public ROW, which already 
supports similar utility structures throughout the City.  Therefore, the utility 
boxes could not be considered an âunusual circumstance.â The Department 
acknowledged that the project could have a negative aesthetic effect, but that 
it wouldnât be so substantial to be considered
 
âsignificantâ under CEQA.  
The Department maintained the cabinets are relatively small in size and would be 
widely dispersed throughout the City.  They would be viewed in the context of 
the existing urban background.  The Department contended that cumulative impacts 
would not occur in part because no other carrier is considering the installation 
of boxes in the ROW.





      This project is subject to DPWâs Surface-Mounted Facilities Order, which 
is a site-specific review process intended to minimize the impact of the utility 
facilities on areas such as aesthetics and pedestrian circulation.  The process 
allows for community review and comment on each cabinet location.  During the 
hearing, some Board members requested enforceable protocols to ensure that 
future siting of the cabinets would be responsive to community concerns.  Mainly 
on these grounds, the Board continued the vote on the matter to May 24.




·
        




There was a new ordinance introduced BF 110506 
Limited Live Performance 
Permits. 
Introduced by Supervisor Mirkarimi.  Ordinance, that would amend 
the SF Police code, SF Planning Code, and the  SF Business and Tax Regulation 
Code to create a Limited Permit for indoor locations, whose primary function is 
not presentation of live performances, said permit to include noise, and hours 
restrictions but not necessarily security plan requirements; specifying 
application and license fees and hearing requirements for said permit.




 




BOARD OF APPEALS
:




Last week, the 
Board of Appeals heard three items that may be of interest to the Planning 
Commission:




3175 24
th
 
Street
 
â An appeal of a building permit application to remove a general advertising 
sign.  The Appeallant (property owner) argued that they did not give 
authorization for the permit holder (sign company â CBS) to remove the subject 
general advertising sign and have no intent of abandoning the sign.  The 
Department argued that the sign was lawfully (including receipt of final 
inspection) and cannot be replaced.  The Board voted 3-2 to uphold the 
Department.




281 Turk Street
 
â An appeal of a building permit application to establish a pharmacy at the 
subject property.  The Appellants raised concerns that the pharmacy would 
contribute to the proliferation of prescription drugs on the streets, in an area 
that has been called âpill hill.â While three of the five members of the Board 
were opposed to the project, they did not have the required four votes to 
overturn the permit.  The two members of the Board who supported the project 
requested adoption of conditions of approval proposed by the Police Department 
to address security concerns; however, they did not have the four votes required 
to modify the permit. Ultimately, the Board voted unanimously to approve the 
permit with conditions.




350 Mission 
Street 


â An appeal made 
by the adjacent property at 50 Beale Street of the Commissionâs (unanimous) 
approval of Section 309 exemptions (specifically exemptions for bulk and tower 
separation). The Board voted 4-1 to uphold the Commissionâs decision.




 





Historic Preservation Commission
:




No 
report â It did not meet this week.

Parking in South of Market and Mission Bay
 -
 




The Commission will consider a proposed Ordinance introduced by Supervisor Daly 
amending the San Francisco Planning Code by amending Sections 151, 151.1, 155, 
161, 249.1, 249.23 and Part VII of Article 9 (1) 


to remove 
minimum parking requirements and establish maximum parking limits in M-1, C-M, 
and South of Market districts and the Folsom and Main Residential/Commercial and 
Fourth and Freelon Streets Special Use Districts to make them consistent with 
those of neighboring districts, (2) to require that non-residential and 
non-hotel parking in C-3 in the South of Market Mixed Use districts adjacent to 
Downtown maintain a fee structure which discourages long-term commuter parking, 
(3) to make parking controls in the Mission Bay Districts that are subject to 
the Planning Code consistent with requirements of neighboring districts; and 
adopting findings, including environmental findings, Section 302 findings, and 
findings of consistency with the General Plan and priority policies of Planning 
Code Section 101.1.

800 PRESIDIO 
AVENUE
 
- southeast corner of Presidio Avenue and 

Sutter Streets (Assessor's Block 1073, Lot 13) - 
Certification of Final 
Environmental Impact Report
 - The project sponsors, Booker T. Washington 
Community Services Center and Equity Community Builders, LLC, propose to 
demolish the existing 12,600-square-foot Booker T. Washington Community Services 
Center building, presumed an historic resource for purposes of environmental 
review, and to construct a mixed-use structure, which would replace and enlarge 
the community/recreation center and include new residential uses. The project 
would encompass about 68,206 square feet of space on six levels, five above 
grade and one below at a height of 55 feet along Presidio Avenue. The roughly 
20,726 square-foot community center space would accommodate the centerâs current 
and future programs and would include a gymnasium, meeting space, and several 
classrooms. The project also comprises a total of 50 affordable residential 
units, including 24 units for emancipated foster youth, 24 affordable units for 
persons earning up to 60 percent of area median income, and two units for onsite 
building managers. The project proposes 21 parking spaces in a basement garage 
accessible from Sutter Street. The project requires amendments to the Planning 
Code to establish a âPresidio-Sutter Affordable Housing Special Use District,â 
subject to approval by the Board of Supervisors to reclassify the siteâs height 
limit from a 40-X height and bulk district to up to a 55-X height and bulk 
district, and to increase the residential density beyond permitted limits 
established by the Planning Code. The project would also request exceptions to 
Planning Code provisions related to street trees, rear yard, usable open space 
and dwelling unit exposure through a Planned Unit Development subject to 
Conditional Use authorization by the Planning Commission.




Preliminary 
Recommendation: certify the Environmental Impact Report






NOTE: The 
public review period for the Draft Environmental Impact Report is closed. The 
Planning Commission does not conduct public review of Final EIRs. Public 
comments on the certification may be presented to the Planning Commission during 
the public comment portion of the Commission calendar.

- east side between Sutter and Post Streets, Lot 013 in Assessor's 
Block 1073 - Consideration of a proposed ordinance introduced by Supervisor 
Farrell requesting
 Rezoning and Text Amendments 
to the Planning Code and 
Zoning Map to establish the Presidio-Sutter Special Use District (SUD) in 
association with a proposed community center and affordable housing project 
pursuant to Planning Code Sections 302 and 306.  The 
Planning Code Text 
Amendment
 would establish the Presidio-Sutter SUD by adding Planning Code 
Section 249.53.  The SUD would allow dwelling unit density and building height 
bonuses for projects with an affordable housing component beyond the amount 
required by the Planning Code.  
Zoning Map Amendments
 would include (1) 
establishing the Presidio-Sutter SUD at Lot 013 in Assessorâs Block 1073 on 
Zoning Map Sheet SU03 and (2) amending the height limit from 40-X to 40-X/55-X 
on Zoning Map Sheet HT03.
