The 34th Americaâs Cup and James R. Herman Cruise Terminal and Northeast Wharf 
Plaza Projects
 Draft Environmental Impact Report




-
 
Public Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Report
:  The City and County of 
San Francisco (CCSF) and the Americaâs Cup Event Authority propose to host the 
34th Americaâs Cup (AC34) sailing races in San Francisco Bay  in 2012 and in 
2013.  Venues proposed for the AC34 events are piers, water areas, and 
facilities managed by the Port of San Francisco (Port) including: Piers (Piers 
19, 19½, 23, 27-29½, 26, 28, 30-32, and 80), water basins/water areas (Piers 
19-23, 23-27, 29‑31, 14-22½, 26‑28, 28-30, and 32-36), and Seawall Lot 330. 
Various other venues are proposed for spectator‑related activities, some of 
which are under the jurisdiction of other City, state or federal agencies, 
including Crissy Field, Marina Green, Fort Mason, Aquatic Park, Alcatraz Island, 
Fort Baker Pier at Cavallo Point (near Sausalito), SF Civic Center, Union 
Square, and Justin Herman Plaza. The event venues would include team bases and 
operations, support space, media operations, hospitality services, commercial 
space, entertainment and spectator areas, and temporary berthing and mooring 
facilities for race-related and spectator vessels. The Port proposes the 
development of Pier 27 as the James R. Herman Cruise Terminal and Northeast 
Wharf Plaza, which would be phased to allow Americaâs Cup Village uses at Piers 
27-29, including an initial phase of the cruise terminal building, for the 2013 
AC34. The Cruise Terminal project would involve demolition of the existing Pier 
27 shed, a portion of the Pier 29 shed, and Pier 27 Annex Building, and 
construction of a 91,200 square foot, two-story cruise terminal building along 
Pier 27. The Northeast Wharf Plaza would provide a 2½-acre open space at the 
south end of Pier 27, fronting along The Embarcadero promenade including a 
multi-use recreational space and ancillary structures for commercial and 
recreational services. 





Preliminary Recommendation: No Action Required.


Note: written comments will be accepted at the Planning Departmentâs offices 
until the close of business on August 25, 2011.
