5.          Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals
BOS
Re:  Legislation from Supervisor Newson
- This legislations proposes to have a study be conducted by the Planning Department regarding the loss of theatres.
Re:  Legislation from Supervisor Peskin
- This legislation proposes that fees, specifically park fund, jobs housing linkage, child care and inclusionary fees, not be collected by the Planning Department but instead be collected by the Treasurer.  The second part of this legislation would be to amend the definition of office use in order to exclude certain square footage in certain activities that are now included in the definition.
Both these pieces of legislation will be referred to the Planning Department for both environmental review and for consideration by the Planning Commission.
BOA
Re:  2 Upland
- The Planning Commission took Discretionary Review on September 6, 2001 and disapproved the project.
-  The Commission had concerns that it was not a code compliant building since there was some work that was done without a permit.  There had been permits for work done on an alternate address.
- The Zoning Administrator reviewed the case file. He realized that the owner had re-designed the building.  The Board of Appeals continued the item for three weeks since the project seemed like a different project.  The Zoning Administrator will examine this project to see if it needs another 311 notice.
Re:  626 29th Street
- This case was heard by the Commission in November.  It also had a variance for a front setback.
- There were three buildings in a row that were in the rear yard.  The applicant wanted to build a building in the front and retain the existing single-family development in the rear, remove the kitchen and allow the owner's mother to live there.
- The Commission and the Zoning Administrator felt that there was too much opportunity to be two units in a single-family district.
- The Board heard the discussion and was sensitive to the concerns the Commission expressed and the concerns the Zoning Administrator had about the rear yard building.  However, they did want to see that the owner remove the kitchen and make sure that there was no direct access to the rear yard building.  They also required a notice-of-special-restriction that would require the building be removed upon the sale of the building or upon death.  
- The Board of Appeals continued the matter for three weeks.

SPEAKER(S):
(-) John Sheets – Dr Requestor
- There are 64 signers that represent 44 households who are opposed to this project.

- Most of the homes were built in the 30s.

SPEAKER(S):
(-) Jim Maxwell – President of the Marina Merchants Association
- He had requested to the project sponsor that he consider lending the space to another theatre operator and to consider the impact that the loss of the theatre would have to their community.
- Although the theatre has closed, they decided to file a Discretionary Review because of their concerns:  added traffic congestion, the demise of other small businesses, the relocation or eviction of three small businesses from the property.
-          He hopes that the Commission takes into consideration their issues, take Discretionary Review and disapprove the site permit application as submitted.
(-) Patricia Vaughey – Marina/Cow Hollow Neighbors and Merchants Association 
- They put out two questionnaires to various neighborhood stores basically asking them what they wanted at this location.
- Although there are a large number of people who want to keep the theatre use, there are other neighbors who are ok with having Walgreen's in the neighborhood.
- If the Commission were to approve Walgreen's, the association would like to state a few conditions:  1) hours of operation would be 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.; 2) deliveries would be scheduled from 5:00 a.m. to 7:30 a.m.; 3) there is a yellow zone to 9:00 a.m.; 4) keep existing faÃ§ade as much as possible; 5) building envelope shall not be expanded; 6) faÃ§ade may not be tiled; 7) exterior doors and windows shall be wood framed; 8) windows at the upper portion shall remain; 9) Walgreen's shall increase their hardware, toys and five-and-dime products; 10) the magazine rack shall not exceed 6 feet in length and the paper rack shall not exceed 3 feet in length; 11) sidewalks adjacent to the building will be steam cleaned once a month; 12) doors and windows will be kept clean at all times; 13) landscaping shall be installed per Walgreen's discretion; 14) shall encourage public transit; 15) Walgreen's shall use it's best efforts to hire from residents of the Marina/Cow Hollow neighborhood.

- He requested a continuance of this item.  If this is not feasible, he would like to ask the Commission to take Discretionary Review and apply recommendations from staff.
(-) Jordanna Thigpen – Marina Merchants Association
- She is a merchant on Chestnut Street
- There are so many reasons to support having a theatre:  1) business services have dropped because of reduced foot traffic; 2) the location will remain vacant which could be a cause for vandalism; 3) Walgreen's already has a presence in the area.
- Parking will be a problem.
- Dinner theatres would be a better use.
(-) Alfonso Felder – San Francisco Neighborhood Theatre Association

- What is decided upon today will set a precedent to other theatres in the City.
- He would like some time in order to try to find a solution to the closures of theatres.
(+) Jim Reuben – Reuben and Alter – Representing the Project Sponsor
- Everyone from the neighborhood feels that Walgreen's is a good tenant.
- All the speakers seem to be saying is that they want a theater rather than saying that they oppose Walgreen's.
- Even if a Discretionary Review is taken, there will still be no theatre.
- The volume of the building will remain the same.  At the conclusion of the Walgreen's tenancy, it is possible that someone might want to reinstall a theatre facility. The exterior faÃ§ade as well as the marquee will remain.
- Taking Discretionary Review and disapproving the project will not produce results that will please anyone.
(+) Allen Michaan – Renaissance Rialto Theatres
- He has been working for theatres most of his life.
- Either the City subsidizes these theatres to an enormous degree, or close the multiplex theatres.
