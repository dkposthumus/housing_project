SPEAKER (S):
(+) Michelle Sudduth, DR requestor – Russian Hill Community Association
-          Project Sponsor consistently misrepresented information.
-          There is a history of inaccurate, miss-leading and missing information that leads us to reject this project in its entirety and ask you to deny the building permit.
-          In the current configurations the project exceeds the 45 foot limits by using too many devices, such as skylights which increases the ceiling height; and building volume of the fourth floor; and a fifth floor addition--which is actually a mechanical penthouse.
-          The mechanical penthouse is clearly a usable space.
-          Pointed out that the Project Sponsor has misrepresented the light well on the drawings by four (4) feet

One street tree shall be located towards the middle of the building and a second street tree shall be placed toward the west (downhill) side.  If two street trees are not feasible, per DPW, garage entrances along Green Street shall not be permitted.
