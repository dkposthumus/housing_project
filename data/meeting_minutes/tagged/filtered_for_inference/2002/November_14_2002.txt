7.          Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Permit Appeals:
BOS:
Jean Paul Samaha gave a presentation on the link between the Director of Planning, the Planning Department, and the Board of Supervisors.
BOA:
Larry Badiner gave a brief overview of the link between the Zoning Administrator, the Planning Commission and the Board of Appeals.
Board of Appeals matters from November 13, 2002:
The following two items were not appeals of the Commission's actions but appeals of the Zoning Administrator's actions:
344 Taraval Street
- The Department felt that a second story residential unit had been eliminated without proper permits.
- This would have required a Conditional Use.
- The Zoning Administrator suggested they apply for a Conditional Use and/or put the unit back.
- That decision was appealed to the BOA but before this case came before them, the owner filed for a Conditional Use permit.  The BOA continued the case to February 29, 2003 to allow the Commission to hold a hearing on the Conditional Use request.
1968 Powell Street
- This is a site called  Battle Zone  where there are a number of computers used for gaming and other purposes.  The Planning Code has not addressed these issues, yet it does address pinball machines as amusement devises.
- The Zoning Administrator made an interpretation that computers in this case were closest to an amusement devise and there could not be more than 10.  He also determined that this would require a conditional Use.
- The BOA voted +1-3 not to uphold the ZA (which meant the ZA was upheld).
- The BOA rescinded the vote and continued the item requesting that the project sponsor obtain a Conditional Use.
- The neighbors who started this issue will have an opportunity to be heard before the Planning Commission.
