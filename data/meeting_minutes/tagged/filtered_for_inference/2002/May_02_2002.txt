- She believes that the height of the building is too large.  The ambiance and the light will be affected.

                    Preliminary Recommendation:  Take Discretionary Review and approve the building permit application with modifications. 
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Larry Paul – Representing the DR Requestor
- One of the main issues of the DR requestor is that the proposed stair could be used as a separate entrance.
-The DR requestor would like to make sure that the kitchens are removed, the utilities are kept and that the stair in fact is configured in a way so it doesn't give an easy chance for an illegal unit.  
- He would like to request that a Notice of Special Restriction be recorded on the property recognizing that it is only a single-family dwelling and not a multiple unit and this should be done before any other permits or approvals are granted by the City.
(+) Alice Barkley – Representing Project Sponsor
- She and the project architect have been working on coming up with a solution to legalize the illegal parts of the home.  The project sponsor purchased the property after these units were done illegally.
