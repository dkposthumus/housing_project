724-730 VAN NESS AVENUE/ 650-660 TURK STREET - 
Appeal of Preliminary Negative Declarat
ion.
 The proposed project involves the demolition of two existing one-story buildings at 724-730 Van Ness Avenue and 650-660 Turk Street, and the construction of a new building consisting of an approximately 130-foot tall, 14-story tower fronting on Van Ness Avenue and a 67-foot tall, 7-story tower fronting on Turk Street above a two-level subsurface parking garage and ground floor retail space, accessory office and recreation/laundry room.  The project site is located on Lots 4 and 8 in Assessor's Block 742.  The vacant 724 Van Ness Avenue building was formerly occupied by about 4,500 square feet of retail space. At  730 Van Ness Avenue, there currently exists about 1,500 square feet of restaurant space.  The existing structure at 650-660 Turk contains 9,750 square feet and is currently occupied by an auto repair business at street level and an auto glass repair shop at the mezzanine level.  The new building would consist of about 134 dwelling units on floor levels 2 through 14 with lobby access from Van Ness Avenue, 45 independently-accessible parking spaces for the dwelling units on two parking levels with vehicular access from Turk Street, and ground floor space allocated to an approximately 1,530 square foot community/laundry room, about 830 square feet of office space accessory to the residential complex, and about 2,200 square feet of retail space.  Both project site lots are within a RC-4 District (Residential-Commercial Combined District, High-Density District) and the Van Ness Avenue Special Use District (SUD) as well as a 130-V Height and Bulk District.  The project would require Conditional Use authorization for new construction over 40 feet in height. The project sponsor would also need to seek Variances regarding off-street parking.

9. Director's Announcements


Re:  Computer Budget


- On Monday, May 20, 2002, the Director was requested to represent the Planning Department before a committee that goes by the acronym of COIT.  The department had to present its computer spending plan and show how this is going to correct the computer problems.  Once the plans are released and the funds are released, we estimate that it will be about three weeks before the equipment is installed and everything is up and running.


Re:  Audit


- The Planning Department has been asked to respond to the audit that has been prepared by the budget analyst of the Board of Supervisors.  The Department has responded to that.  Copies of the audit and responses will be provided to the Commission as soon as it is available.

BOA - 


Re:  2 Upland Drive


- This case was before the Commission on December 14, 2001.  The Commission expressed concern about the height of the third floor addition.  The neighbors did not know what was going on.  There were questions on the design.  The Commission denied this project sending a clear message that this case should have had a good design through a process that should be upfront.  This case was before the Board of Appeal a few weeks ago with a totally new design.  The Board sent this project back to be analyzed by the neighbors.  The neighbors were not in favor of this new design.  The Board felt that there is and should be a true procedural process. This project needs to start from scratch with new permits and a 311 notice process that provides an opportunity for the neighbors to decide if they want to file a Discretionary Review.


Re:  2518 Union Street


- This case was before the Commission on March 14, 2002 and the Commission took Discretionary Review to modify the project.   The project sponsor before the Board of Appeals appealed the modifications.  The Board decided to continue this case for two weeks since it appears that both parties involved are very close to a compromise.

533 SUTTER STREET - Assessor's Block 296, Lot 13D
 - Appeal of a Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration.
  The project site is currently developed with a two-story-plus-basement building containing a mix of retail, office, and theater uses.  The proposed project would involve the conversion of 4,200 gross square feet (gsf) of existing second-floor offices and theater use to four dwelling units and construction of three additional floors of residential use with four dwelling units on each new floor, for a total of 16 dwelling units.  The existing ground-floor retail would remain as is.  The proposed project would add three stories, approximately 36 feet in height, for a total building height of approximately 65 feet.  The proposed project would add 15,000 gsf of new construction, for a total building floor area of 23,200 gsf.  The project site at 533 Sutter Street (Assessor's Block 0296, Lot 13D) is about 6,050 square feet in size and is located mid-block on the southern side of Sutter Street in the Downtown/Civic Center neighborhood on the block bounded by Mason, Sutter, Powell, and Post Streets.  The entrance and access to the project site would be from Sutter Street.  The existing building has no parking or loading spaces and none are proposed.  The project site is zoned C-3-R (Downtown Retail) District and is within an 80-130-F Height/Bulk District.
