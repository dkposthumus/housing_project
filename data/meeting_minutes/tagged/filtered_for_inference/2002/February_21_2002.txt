Re:  Commissioner Salinas' Concern
The matter that was discussed under last week's Public Comment category was a follow-up to a written request for a continuance that was made prior to that hearing.  The appropriate way to ask for a continuance is to provide a written request in advance so that the matter can be placed on the calendar as an item proposed for continuance to a date that staff and all parties involved have agreed to.
Re:  Work Program and Budget for Fiscal Year 2002-2003
- Tnis matter will be discussed during the hearing of February 28, 2002.
- This document (he held up the document) will be placed in Commissioner's packets for next week's hearing.
Re:  Community Planning Workshops
- Last night, the Department held the third in a series of five introductory workshops in the South of Market community plan area. 
- Mayor Brown attended and the Planning staff co-facilitated with Supervisor Daly.
- It was a very successful event.
- The next date to meet regarding South of Market will be April 6, 2002 at the South of Market Recreation Center.
- Tonight will be the fourth in the series of five community workshops.  This one will be held in the Bay View.
- This workshop will be unique because it will be a part of the Redevelopment process working hand in hand with the Bay View PAC.
- The last of these workshops will be in Visitation Valley.

BOA
Re:  240 San Fernando Drive
- This was a Discretionary Review for an addition of a third story.
- The Planning Commission took Discretionary Review to modify the design.
- The building's redesign was appealed to the Board of Appeals -- they upheld the Commission +5 -0.
Re:  50 Mason Street
- This item was not before the Commission but is important to mention.
- There was a complaint that someone was doing work without a permit, it appeared to be some kind of adult oriented entertainment.  The owner came in to get a permit for an adult bookstore.  This was not approved.  Then the owner came in to get a permit for retail apparel, and because this is a permitted use, the permit was approved.  Apparently this turned out to be an establishment for modeling negligee.  The permit was suspended.  The suspension of the permit was upheld by the Board of Appeals +5 -0.

                    Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with modifications.
                    (Continued from Regular Meeting of February 14, 2002)
SPEAKER(S):
(+) Bill Barns
- It is Supervisor Daly's intent to balance the concerns from groups in the community with groups who want to build market-rate housing, affordable housing and other uses.
- It is his hope that this legislation will require staff review prior to projects moving far along in the pipeline so that the concerns can be mitigated.
- He submitted a letter of support from the San Francisco Green School Yards Alliance.
(-) Bob Passmore
- The modifications submitted today have improved the legislation.
- He still believes that this is a superfluous piece of legislation.
- All new schools would have to go through the normal review process (that included shadow review).
(-) Joe O'Donaghue
- This piece of legislation is still very paradoxical.
- Shadow studies are expensive.
- This legislation should not proceed until an analysis is done on what public harm or what public good this will do.
(-) Phillip Smith – Director of Real Estate, San Francisco Unified School District
- The School District would like to be able to give their opinion on this.  They would like to do an analysis, and would like to be allowed to comment on it.
- It would be nice to have some dialogue with the DCA as well as others involved in this.
(-) Tim Tosta – Steffel, Levitt and Weiss

                    Consideration of adoption of amendments to the existing Planning Commission Inclusionary Housing Policies
                    (Continued from Regular Meeting of February 14, 2002)
                    NOTE:  On February 7, 2002, following public testimony, the Commission closed public hearing and continued the matter to February 14, 2002 for final action.  Public hearing will remain open on any new recommendations for approval.
SPEAKER(S):
(-) Tim Tosta – Steffel, Levitt and Weiss
- He ran a comparison of a rental project.
- Fourteen percent will always be more than 12 percent.
(-) Steve Vettel – Morrison and Forrester
- The owner occupied imposition at 14 percent does not work.
- The rental project at 14 percent seems to be ok.
- The ownership units should be at 12 percent at 100 percent of median income.
- What the department is proposing is significantly more burdensome to developers.
(-) Rev. Arnold Townsed
- He would rather have percentages dropped.
- Staff still states a preference for on site.
- He would rather see no preference and let the Commission decide on each proposal without staff coming in with the preference.
(-) Bob Meyers
- He is here to speak for Bill Poland, who could not attend the hearing.
- Mr. Poland supports the needs of affordable housing and would like to commend staff in developing these policies.  These policies and the proposal heard last week are very well intentioned yet his project cannot meet the level of affordability.
(-) Joe O'Donaghue
- Conditional Uses are a deterrent 
- This needs to be looked at more closely.
(-) John Bardis
- This City does not need something more complex.
- It's better that the City focuses on building affordable housing.
- He hopes that the Commission will let the policy stand as it is.
(-) Bob Passmore
- He does not understand the economics of this or whether this policy will work or not.  But given what Dr. Ghosh said several weeks ago about the type of housing that is being built, there should be a policy that would require affordable housing across the board.
- He is concerned that the risk factor for a developer has not been taken into consideration.
- There is very little incentive here for developers.
ACTION:          Approved with the following modifications:  The policy applies to all projects with 10 or more units with the following requirements:
Rental
As-of-Right: 10% inclusionary requirement at 60 % of Area Median Income (AMI)
CU or Section 309: 12% at a rotating basis of 80%, 100%, 120% of AMI (See explanation of rotating basis on page 8 of the resolution.)
Owner-Occupied (Condo)
As-of-Right: 10% at a rotating basis of 80%, 100%, 120% of AMI

SPEAKER(S):
(+) Kim Stryke – Project Sponsor
- She and her husband live in this property.

- She has been doing some research and found out there is no history on file related to permits for the units and/or for a kitchen.
- She would like the Commission to approve the project so it can go back to its original configuration.
(+) Ted Loewenberg
- He is a friend of the family but also is a member of the Victorian Alliance.

- This project is basically for a homeowner to bring his son back to the city and be able to work in his own home.
- There are other penthouses being built around the city since people are requiring more space.
(+) Stanley Chan
- Steven Chu read a letter written by Mr. Stanley Chan.
- Many of the buildings in the neighborhood are about the same height as his house.

(+) Steven Chu
- He is a retired structural engineer
- The extension of the house will allow a family to live together.
