 TRANSFER AND REUSE OF NAVAL STATION TRESURE ISLAND
 - 
Certification of the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) -
 The Environmental Impact Report analyzes the potential environmental impacts of the conveyance of former Naval Station Treasure Island (NSTI) from the U.S. Navy to the Treasure Island Development Authority (TIDA). NSTI includes both Yerba Buena Island and Treasure Island, and is located in Central San Francisco Bay, within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City and County of San Francisco. The EIR also analyzes, as a consequence of conveyance, three reuse alternatives based upon the Reuse Plan for NSTI (1996), which includes a variety of public oriented uses such as sports fields, a film production center, conference center, hotels, a themed attraction, educational and child care facilities, a fire fighter training school, public open space, and up to 2,800 housing units. The EIR also evaluates the expansion of the existing Clipper Cove Marina at a project-level. The Navy has published a separate Final Environmental Impact Statement evaluating the potential environmental effects of the disposal and reuse of NSTI to comply with Federal requirements. 


Preliminary Recommendation: Certify Environmental Impact Review


NOTE:
 The public hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Review is closed. The public comment period for the Draft Environmental Impact Report ended on October 21, 2003. TIDA and the Planning Commission do not conduct public review of Final Environmental Impact Reviews. Public comments on the certification may be presented to TIDA and the Planning Commission during the Public Comment portion of the TIDA - Planning Commission calendar.
