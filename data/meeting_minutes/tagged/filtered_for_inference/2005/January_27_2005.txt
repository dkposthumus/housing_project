Commissioner Antonini:


Re:
 
  Planning Commission Hearings not being televised


- It is important to get some funding to televise the Planning Commission hearings.


- This is a service that is very commendable to continue.


 


Commissioner W. Lee


Re: Chinatown Economic Development Group


- There is a sense that Commissioners make decisions that involve fees but there are no resources to follow up that these fees are actually paid.


 


Interim Director Macris responded:


- This is more of an auditing effort than of enforcement if the Commission wants to allow a city agency to be assigned to do auditing.


 


Commissioner Hughes:


Re:
 
  President Kathleen Harrington


- He recommended that the meeting be adjourned in the name of Kathleen Harrington.

SPEAKER(S):


(+) Marcia Rosen – Director of the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency


- This agreement represents a historic collaboration between two very important departments.


- There is a delegation agreement that epitomizes the strengths and talents of both agencies so that they can work together.


- The actual work on the substance of the plans and the proposals is the most important thing here.


- The plan is greatly enhanced from the collective ownership of crafting it.


(+) George Williams - SPUR


- He commended both agencies for doing what should have been done a long time ago.


- It is important that both agencies specify what each agency will be responsible for so that in particular, the Planning Commission will not loose jurisdiction.


(+) Clark Mannus – Transbay CAC


- They talked a lot about the delegation agreement.


- It is really important to address the issues that projects might bring up.


- The delegation agreement is a good thing but it needs to be very clear.


(+) Bob Meyers – Citizen’s Advisory Committee for Transbay


- This is a great plan and has been worked on for about 12 years.


- He would like to know which project would be only under the jurisdiction of the Redevelopment Agency.

- They support the urban forum and land use, the tower separation, the slimmer more beautiful towers, parking spaces for car share programs, and public amenities.


- The only concerns that they have are the park location because it will be next to the Bay Bridge and the proper enforcement of the plan.


 


(+) Kate White – Housing Action Coalition


- They support the plan concepts but would like to see the specific code language.


- They thanked staff for their hard work.


- They are anxious to see this plan move forward.


- It is important that both project sponsors agree to combine one tower, which would be an exception to the 150-foot tower separation.


(+) William Wilson – Open Park Committee


- They have listened to various presentations by staff.


- This has been a very open process.

(+) Peter Cohen – Urban Solutions

(+) Tom Redulovich – Transportation for a Livable City


- It is important that this plan does not become exceptions to the rule.


- He thanks staff for specifying a set of rules that will generate good projects.

- Surveys should be done on an unbiased basis.


(+) Debra Stein


- She appreciates that the Archdiocese projects will be “grandfathered” into the plan.


- She is concerned with the height of the towers.


- The well-meaning efforts are good but a single tower would be a risk.

(+) Bob Myers


- The two pipeline projects will blend with the existing urban fabric.


- He is glad that these projects will be “grandfathered” into the plan.


(+) Theodore Brown – 375 Fremont Street


- His project has been changing because of various instructions he has been receiving.


- If Rincon Hill will be the most exclusive, then all 500-foot buildings should be built.

- He is glad that his project will be “grandfathered” into the plan.


 


(+) Reed Bement – Rincon Hill Association


- He is pleased to encourage what staff has stated.


- The draft plan is an excellent piece of work and staff should be commended.

- No further exceptions to the plan should be made.


- He urged the Commission to stick to the recommendations from staff and not make any exceptions.


(+) April Veneracion – SOMCAN


- She is concerned with the following issues:

- She is pleased to hear that the borders of the Rincon Hill plan include her neighborhood.


(+) George Williams – SPUR


- They love this plan because it goes far beyond revising the zoning.


- It allows for comprehensive planning.

(-) Sue Hestor


- She asked that staff have available the staff report and the EIR two weeks before the hearing.
 


- There is nothing discussed in the plan about transit lines and changes to these lines.


- Someone has to say that transit lines will be added.


- Greater heights equal greater value and higher costs.


- It is important to make sure where offsite Inclusionary housing will be located.

- He hopes that the Commission will allow for the Archdiocese projects to be included into the plan.


(+) Lou Blazej – Archdiocese of San Francisco


- He would like the department to not deny their plan


- Having a locked in location in the plan is great.


- This plan will create a diversified area.


(+) Don Morkel – Local 22


- The issue of the two towers should be included in the plan and the height of the towers should be kept to see if there is a market for it.


(+) Azalia Merrill – Local 22


- Working on a good number of housing projects, she can literally hear construction workers say that they hate to work on housing projects that they cannot live in.


- Various neighborhoods in San Francisco do not have affordable housing any more.

Appeal of Preliminary Negative Declaration
 - The proposed project would include demolition of an existing 4,344 gross-square-foot, one-story retail/commercial building and rear storage building and construction of a five-story, 50-foot-tall mixed-use building which would contain 32 residential units on the second through fifth floors and retail/commercial use on the ground floor.
 
 The residential use would be 27,491 gross square feet (gsf) in area, and the retail/commercial space would be 4,344 gsf in size.
 
 The ground floor and basement levels would include 32 parking spaces designated for the residential use with ingress and egress from South Van Ness Avenue. The ground floor would contain the commercial space and residential lobby.
 
 The 12,253-square-foot site is located within the C-M (Heavy Commercial) zoning district and within a 50-X height and bulk district. The project is within the Housing Mixed Use PDR District and within the Eastern Neighborhood Policies adopted by the Planning Commission.

Substitution of Mitigation Measure and Addendum to a Final Negative Declaration.
 
 Re-evaluation of the revised project, detailed in the following agenda items for the project (Case Nos. 2004.0636C and 2004.0636V), led to an Addendum (December 20, 2004) to the prior Negative Declaration (Case No. 1999.0414E, Final Negative Declaration, February 29, 2000). The revisions to the project would increase the number of units from 59 to 70, an increase of 11 units; increase the number of parking spaces from 57 to 70, with use of mechanical lifts; eliminate a proposed roof deck and solarium and reduce the floors of the building by one (from 22 stories to 21 stories); and widen and landscape a portion of the Fremont Street sidewalk as provision of open space.
 
 The revised project would maintain the same height and mass of the building analyzed in the final Negative Declaration. The Addendum found that the conclusions of the prior Negative Declaration, with an updated mitigation measure, remain current and valid.
 
 In the resource area of archaeology, a modified, more intensive archeological resources mitigation measure, based on more recent information regarding potential archeological resources in the project vicinity is being required.
 
 The other mitigation measures remain unchanged and a revised Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan, including the new mitigation measure, has been prepared for project adoption. The CEQA Guidelines, Section 15074.1, states that a public hearing be held and findings made when one mitigation measure is deleted from a Negative Declaration for a project and another is substituted and a determination be made that the new mitigation measure is, “[E]quivalent or more effective” in avoiding or reducing the potential adverse effect of the project.
 
 This finding will be made during Commission consideration of the project for approval.


                     
  
 
 Preliminary Recommendation: Hold public hearing on substitution of mitigation measure.
