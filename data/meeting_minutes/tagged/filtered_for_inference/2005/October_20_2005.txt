- 
Motion to Waive Rincon Hill Community Infrastructure Impact Fees per Section 318.3(f)
 - The Planning Commission approved a project at 425 First Street on August 4, 2005, that includes approximately 710 dwelling units. Planning Code Section 318.3(b)(i) requires payment of $11.00 per net occupiable square foot of residential development for the Rincon Hill Community Infrastructure Fund prior to issuance of site permit. The project construction is divided into two phases, the first of which would require a payment of approximately $4,580,000. The project sponsor has entered into a Waiver Agreement with the City, to the satisfaction of the Planning Department and City Attorney, to secure the formation of a Community Facilities (Mello-Roos) District and to take all necessary steps to support the construction of a portion of the public improvements, equal to the value owed by the sponsor, and described in the Planning Code 318.6 and in the Rincon Hill Plan.

COMMISSIONERS’ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS

 Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner Antonini:




Comment on a couple things of importance that relates in particular to some moves that have been expressed by members of the Board of Supervisors in regards to inclusionary housing--some possible changes; and particularly to an editorial in today’s Examiner which talks a little bit about this.


We are in the process of considering Better Neighborhoods and Eastern Neighborhoods.


My comments are that this – everything has to work together and that we have to look at the big picture and not center on merely one part of it as in the inclusionary housing.


I’m afraid we could be developing the perfect storm that could eliminate a lot of housing demand in San Francisco.


We could conceivably see and increase the percentage of inclusionary housing at the level at which the inclusionary housing might be assessed.


I spent some time reading the Downtown Plan as well as read – which was an excellent document - the Housing Inventory document.
 
 An interesting thing was pointed out, and that was that we had been building affordable housing.


In fact, from 1996 to 2002, 375 units were built which represents 25% of all units built in San Francisco during that period.
 
 That does not include public housing.


You cannot exclude certain parts of the housing market and say we are only going to consider this part of it.
 
 I personally feet that these issues may have a very deleterious effect as I mentioned earlier on the production of new housing.
 
 But more importantly, I think that they do not address the real need.
 
 The real need is the so-called middle class or working class of the City who makes too much money to qualify for the present inclusionary housing and yet do not have enough income to afford market rate housing.
 
 These things only drive the market rates up higher.




Commissioner Bradford-Bell:




This Tuesday at the Redevelopment Agency, several members from the Hunters Point project Area Committee spoke out in strong protest against the status of the Environmental Impact Report in the Bayview, and I feel there are some complications surrounding that.


I have spoken to Director Macris about it.


I know that Director Rosen will be at the PAC meeting.


There is a meeting at Redevelopment today to talk about it and find out where we are.


I am requesting that we calendar an informational item under the Director’s Report for next week, because I have a lot of questions and I am hoping that we can have that on the agenda next week to get an update of what has transpired, what our role is, where the EIR is at the moment, what needs to be done, what kind of solutions we are putting forward because the community is very concerned that they are being asked to wait on the EIR but Planning is still doing projects in the community.

Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals




 
 
          
 
BoS
:




The Sacramento Street Neighborhood Commercial District amendments sponsored by Supervisor Alioto-Pier
 
to allow an expansion of University High School were finally passed by the Board two days ago on Tuesday, along with the legislative setback line amendments along Clement Street to allow the Beth Shalom project to proceed. Both of these were passed unanimously consistent with your recommendations.


1070 Sanchez Street
 
– an item that appears on your calendar today--a Discretionary Review. This is a project on which the CEQA document was appealed.
 
 That appeal was held on Tuesday at the Board.
 
 The Board unanimously upheld the Department’s determination that the project was categorically exempt from environmental review.


In our actions category
:
 
 A number of changes have been made to 
medical cannabis dispensaries.
 
 Largely in keeping with your recommendation, Supervisor Mirkarimi’;s proposed ordinance has progressed
.
 
 It’s been reviewed by the Budget and Finance Committee.
 
 It ‘s been reviewed at the full Board of Supervisors and continues now until next week for a potential adoption on first reading.


A couple of changes to that ordinance in keeping with your recommendations, the Supervisor has made allowances for two dispensaries in the City to operate on a 24-hour basis.


A number of changes include the modification of controls to not permit dispensaries in either M District or in South of Market District.
 
 This is a change with a substantial geographic element to it.


With respect to this ordinance, there has been an amendment to require that you hold a mandatory discretionary review hearing for all medical dispensary permits filed within the City.


Moving on to Introductions:


Supervisor Duffy has introduced an ordinance that would modify the zoning controls on 24
th
 Street in Noe Valley in order to allow a limited number of full service restaurants
.
 
 Right now the code does not allow any new full service restaurant in Noe Valley.


This ordinance will be coming before you in the next several months.


Supervisor Daly introduced an ordinance that deals not with the Planning Code, but rather with the Subdivision Code
.
 
 Although this will not come to you, it is relevant.


This proposed ordinance would require all condominium conversions that are processed through the city’s lottery to be reviewed by the Planning Commission for consistency with the General Plan.
 
 Right now the Planning Commission only review conversion projects of five or six-units.
 
 This would effectively include three and four-unit condo conversions as well.


Supervisor Daly also introduced a draft of an ordinance regarding inclusionary housing amendment
 
to take the existing percentages of 10 and 12% for as of right and conditional permitted projects respectively, and increase those percentages to 15 and 20%.


Supervisor McGoldrick also introduced an ordinance to take the threshold at which the inclusionary housing requirement
 
is assessed--which is currently projects of ten-units or more--and lower that threshold to five or more units.


In other words, multi-family housing projects of five or more units would be subject to your inclusionary housing policies.

We wanted to take advantage of our back yards and view and create space for guests and the expansion for our family.


The design is mindful of the neighborhood character and has the least impact possible to its surrounding.


Our outreach included meeting with the community review board--and they felt comfortable with our proposal.


The proposed addition adds 245 square feet that includes a master bedroom with closet and a bathroom.


There will also be a deck on top of the addition connected to the second floor.


All windows in the house will be upgraded to double panels.

SPEAKERS:
    


Ray Cole, Discretionary Review Requestor




Their soil report indicates there are four or five unstable feet that they are going to build this on.


The planner saw the lateral movement in the retaining wall.


This is a hazardous site.
 
 And because it is a hazardous site we agree with the soil engineers report which cautious, and I quote “utmost care should be exercised in avoiding damage to the other property.”


The tiers should be carried five feet into rock from 10 to 20 feet below existing grade.


Despite these clear recommendations the structural engineer does not indicate the depth of the piers or the size of the piers.


They failed to show drainpipe termination and failed to indicate details of drainage.




Ken Snyder, Property Owner




I think we have entered into this project with a spirit of cooperation.
 
  We provided information to each of our neighbors.


The elements themselves will have a minimal impact on the neighbors.


The dining room in the rear is a partial courtyard on level ground.


The six-foot addition to the front of the house is just to provide a balcony and extend the room underneath.


We provided information including the soil report.

Mandatory Discretionary Review
 under the Planning Commission’s policy requiring review of residential demolition, of Demolition Permit Application No.
 
2004.05.27.5002
, proposing to demolish a one-story over garage single-family dwelling, located in a RH-3 (Residential, House, Three-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
  
Do not take Discretionary Review and approve demolition.


 


SPEAKERS:
    


Alice Barkley, representing the Project Sponsor




There are three major components that make this building unsound


One is that the roof rafters are inadequate.
 
 In order to fix it, you have to take the roof off so that you can get in the structure.
 
 In evaluating the replacement cost, we don’t want to get rid of the interior and then get into areas that are not permissible because they may be considered cosmetic.


The second is the foundation.
 
 The mortar has absolutely no integrity left.
 
 The foundation cannot support the vertical force.
 
 It has to be replaced.


Finally, some of the major beams and columns in the basement area that support the building—they are not even continuous—are sort of spliced together.
 
 There is a need for a steel frame to replace that so that the building is rehabilitated.
 
 If it is rehabilitated it will be able to support the upper floor.




 


 


Tracy Hughes, Discretionary Review Requestor




The pine tree is indeed rare.
 
 We only have four or five of them in our urban forest in our neighborhoods.
  


What is going on here with this project is--even though they say they want to protect this tree--they’ re going to take out 40% of the roots.


If they are concerned about saving the tree, they need to redesign the plans.




Collins Brennan, Property Owner




Requested the Commission to approve the demolition and new construction of his property.
  


This is the only way economically we can live in Noe Valley.


This house has met all the criteria for demolition.
  
 Please approve our design.




Lori Brennan




Asked Commission to approve their project.




Angus McCarthy




Spoke in support of the Brennans and in favor of this project.




Joe Buttler, Architect




At Monday’s hearing, the Secretary of the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board acknowledged to the Board of Supervisors that in his personal opinion there are buildings here of a quality to support designation of a local historic district.


According to the Planner, the Department can only conclude the building is sound because the costs included in the soundness report are base on shortcomings in the existing house that are not needed repairs to make the building habitable as per Department’s requirements.


He also stated that in many places in the report are devoted to structural deficiencies with little discussion of the building’s other problems.
  


Asked the Commission to take Discretionary Review and disapprove the demolition permit.

SUNOL/NILES DAM REPLACEMENT PROJECT
 
- 
Consider authorizing the Environmental Review Officer to take supplemental public testimony at an additional hearing on the Draft EIR for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission's Sunol/Niles Dam Replacement Project in a jurisdiction outside the City and County of San Francisco
.
 
 The Planning Commission is scheduled to hold a hearing on the draft EIR on December 1, 2005.
 
 The Planning Commission may also authorize the Environmental Review Officer to hold additional public hearings, as provided in San Francisco Administrative Code Sections 31.05 and 31.14.
 
 Because the Sunol/Niles Dam Replacement Project will affect the area in and around the Sunol Valley, which is near the city of Fremont in Alameda County, the Environmental Review Officer recommends holding an additional public hearing in Fremont and is requesting authorization from the Planning Commission to do so.


Preliminary recommendation:
 
 Authorize the Environmental Review Officer to conduct an additional public hearing on the Draft EIR for the Sunol/Niles Dam Replacement Project in Fremont, CA.

2151 Van Ness Avenue, St. Brigid Church
 
- southwest corner of Van Ness Avenue and Broadway.
 
 Assessor’s Block 0575, Lot 15
 
 - The proposal is to 
designate the property as City Landmark
 No. 252.
 
 Constructed between 1902 and 1904, St. Brigid Church was built in a “Richardsonian Romanesque Revival” style over several phases.
 
 The subject property is within an RC-4 (Residential-Commercial Combined, High Density) District, the Van Ness Avenue Special Use District, and an 80-D Height and Bulk District.
 
 Request for the Planning Commission to adopt a resolution approving the designation of St. Brigid Church and recommending to the Board of Supervisors that they approve the designation that they initiated on April 1, 2005.


                       
 Preliminary Recommendation: Adopt a resolution supporting landmark designation.


 


SPEAKERS:
    


Joe Dignan




We are dedicated to saving and preserving St. Brigid for future generations of San Franciscans.


The Archdiocese of San Francisco has sold and closed escrow on St. Brigid Church to a newly formed limited liability company


The Diocese has determined to remove much of the historic fabric of the interior of the building




Anthony Jones, representing the Academy of Our University and 2151 Van Ness Avenue, LLC




 
 On behalf of these two entities, I’m stating for the record an objected to the landmark designation being applied to St. Brigid Church.




Alice Barkley




About three hours ago the Archdiocese asked me to speak on this matter.
 
 I have just read the staff report.


The Archdiocese has sold this building to the Academy of Art, so it is not longer the owner.


This building will no longer be a church.


The Archdiocese objects to the definition to the interior space.


First, Article 10 does not go into the interior of private property.
 
 Only public property that can have interiors designated.


All of the items listed are the personal property of the church.


You cannot tell the church that they cannot take their personal property away.


I think you have to be very cautious when you start to reach into the personal property of the church, because there is still a separation between church and state.


You cannot take their property and put it in the public domain.




John Gregson, Committee to Save St. Brigid Church




There maybe something there regarding easily movable property and things, but we clearly admit we are in somewhat new ground here and that is going to be worked out with the Planning Department as we go forward.


We would also like to thank the Academy of Art for publicly endorsing the preservation of this magnificent gift for all future generations.


Interiors of private buildings can be landmarked.
 
 The Garden Court of the Sheridan Palace Hotel is one.




Joe O’Donoghue, Residential Builders




The Church is no more a church


This is emphasized by the cavalier attitude the Archdiocese took toward its parishioners.


Let me also say that a fixture is a fixture, is a fixture.


Just like the stained glass windows that they might remove.
 
 They’re fixtures.


What the church is doing is destroying the values and shows a contempt for culture when it decided that they are ignoring the great mason work that went into this.


If you are going to be an art, art is supposed to be revolutionary, set standards for values.
 
 They also have an obligation to set new standards to cultural not to manifestation of materialism.


At least we are honest about it we are for profit.




Vincent Marsh




For a number of years, I staffed the landmarks program and was retained by the St Brigid Committee to do the nomination for the church.


Passed forward a letter from the Friends of 1800 Market Street in support of a nomination and indicates that this property was placed on the national register in 1995.
 
 In that nomination the interior and exterior features of the building were called out.


A national register nomination as well as a local nomination does not restrict the use of a property, the maintenance or sale of a property as evidenced by the fact the property is already transferred.
 


The Planning Code does indicate that a property such as this has special character or historical architectural interest and value as a landmark and clearly St. Brigid meets this criteria


Urged the Commission to endorse the landmark case report, motions and resolutions as drafted.




Erin




We have been strong supporters of the efforts to save and preserve this church.
 
 The nomination does a very good job of explaining the features of the building that make it worthy of being a landmark.


The recognition is absolutely worth it.


It is at a very pivotal time right not with it changing hands and there are a lot of opportunities here for the new owner to develop the property.


If it is not landmarked, there is no protection for any of the features.




Sue Maywall




Addressed the argument about the ownership of the property, we give donations to the church not the diocese.




Steve Steelman




Why is the building is not worthy of historic preservation?


The fabric of the building includes both the interior and exterior of the building.


Harry Clark who is a stained glass artist from the early part of the 20th Century in Ireland made the windows.
 
 Every single window that he made in Ireland is preserved - is designated as worthy of historic preservation.




Dennis Conrad




A church is more than just a building or a house of worship.
 
 It is a monument of culture.


If we don’t take care of them, we don’t deserve our future.




January Robinson




Supports the preservation of the church.


It’s exterior is worthy of contemplation, but it’s only upon entering the sacred edifice that it is real.
 
 This is when beauty may be appreciated.




Tom Christian




The new owner of the property is probably the best chance to save St. Brigid.


The Academy of Art has paid for the property and has already publicly stated they will pay for its seismic retrofit.


Retrofitting by its very nature can be invasive.


The church has been remodeled since it was first build.


It is not as it is shown in these pictures today.


I believe there already exists a recorded instrument at the recorder’s office at the Archdiocese recorded prior to selling the property where a man posed upon the property a moratorium on its demolition for a period of time that survives the sale of the property and is on title as a deed restriction.


It is my understanding that the Academy of Art fought very hard with the Archdiocese to assure the same stained glass windows stayed with the property after it was sold.




Ed Conlan, speaking on behalf of the Academy of art




The Academy has stated it is their intent to preserve the church in its entirety


The stained glass windows will be kept intact.


The church has been neglected for 12 years and we would like to get it cleaned up and back operational and open to the public again.




Merrill




Is in favor of landmarking the church.






Richards






Asked the Commission to approve the application.




Kenneth




Reviewed the provisions of Article 10 of the Planning Code as it relates to the preservation of building interiors.


Spoke in favor of the Commission’s support of this application.




ACTION:
          
 Approved as amended:
 
 
Number 7 was split and created Number 8.
 
 Numbers 9, 10, and 11 are new.


8.
        
 The Planning Commission recommends that the Board of Supervisors protect by legislation or ordinance the following interior features to the full extent of the law.


Interior


The interior features to be preserved include: the dark wood paneled narthex, the nave with lower side aisles, transepts and rear choir gallery; the chancel, sacristy, and other spaces at the west end; the stilted-arch arcades; the columns with Romanesque capitals (clad in spirally striped marble): the shallow arch ceiling; the stringcourse of angels and heads circumscribing the main space between the arcade and clerestory, the 10-foot high clerestory statues of angels with outspread wings (sculpted by John A. McQuarrie, alike but in different poses representing the opening sentences of the Mass); the marble sculptures representing the Stations of the Cross, the rounded chancel and half-dome ceiling; the lincrusta wainscoting; the carved-end oak pews; the silver-colored pipes announcing the rear gallery and organ loft; the Rufatti organ; and the stained glass windows (Harry Clarke Studios; Dublin, Ireland).


Other interior features to be preserved also include the wood carved pulpit, wooden interior doors, baptismal font, confessionals, holy water font (angel wings), marble altar, decorative wood floor, decorative wall behind and above the tabernacle, the wooden wainscot, and the church bell.


The interior features to be preserved include not only items that have been annexed to the realty by some type of permanent attachment, but also those items that are technically moveable but have been in place of a long time, such as statues.
 
 An inclusive list “Historic inventory of Interior Features” is included in the designation report.


9.
        
 The designation of St. Brigid Church meets the required findings of Planning Code Section 101.1 in the following manner:


10.
       
  The proposed Project will further Priority Policy No. 7, that landmarks and historic buildings be preserved, such as the designation of the St. Brigid Church as City Landmark No 252.
 
 Landmark designation will help to preserve a significant historic resource associated with patterns of social and cultural history in San Francisco.
 


11.
       
 That the proposed project will have no significant effect on the other seven Priority Policies: the City’s supply of affordable housing, existing housing or neighborhood character, public transit or neighborhood parking, preparedness to protect against injury and loss of life in an earthquake, commercial activity, business or employment, or public parks and open space.

- 
Public Hearing Draft Environmental Impact Report -
 The proposed project would include the development of approximately 142 residential units, approximately 6,300 gross square feet (gsf) of office space, about 2,100 gsf of café space, and a 168-space underground parking garage on an approximately two-acre site in San Francisco’s Central Waterfront district. The project site is located on the northern half of the 900 block of Minnesota Street, between 20th and 22nd Streets, at the street addresses of 900, 910-12 Minnesota Street and 833 Indiana Street (Assessor’s Block 4106; Lot 27). The project site, which is currently unoccupied, consists of six buildings totaling approximately 144,000 square feet; a surface parking area; and three gardens and other landscaping, that make up the C. Schilling & Co. Wine Cellars complex, a contributor to the Dog patch Historic District. The site was most recently the headquarters of the Esprit de Corp. clothing company. The proposed project would be developed through adaptive reuse of two large brick buildings, demolition of four structures, and new construction. The portion of the project site for which new development is proposed is within an M-2 (Heavy Industrial) District, and the southwestern portion of the site is within an RH-3 (Residential, House Three-Family) District. The site is also located within the Central Waterfront Better Neighborhoods Plan Area, and the Dogpatch Historic District.

SPEAKERS ON THE CONTINUANCE REQUEST:


Marilyn Amini




This legislation has been substantially modified since it was formally introduced by Supervisor McGoldrick.


 
  There have been no newspaper notices at all on this proposal.


There are a lot of things wrong with this and I think if you are showing good faith to the public, it should be continued.




Unclear name




 
  Opposes the continuance.




Tim Collins




Urged that the Commission take the matter up tonight.




[Unclear name]


-
 
  Please continue the item.


[Unclear name]




If continued, do you lose the ability to make comments and hear those of us who have come here to speak?


I’m confused that you are allowed this continuance, or do you simply miss the chance?




John Bardis




Where did the ten pages of amendments come from?
 


Not from the legislative body


Not from you.


Then from whom?


Your action today should be to continue it so the legislation can be sent back to the Board.
 
  The Board should then submit those amendments on to the body and then have them come back to you.


You should not proceed with this legislation.




Jeffrey Leibovitz




I was a casual observer at two of these meetings where amendments were drafted; and at the first meeting just by chance.
 
  I happened to meeting with the sponsor of a project and was invited to a meeting on this right on the spot.


There have been substantive changes to the legislation, drafted and introduced by that committee.


I am a firm believer in the public process.


I believe the sponsor said at one of the hearings or one of the meetings that if the Planning Commission did not act on this, then it would be pulled from the Planning Commission and it would go through the legislative process of the Board of Supervisors regardless of what you do.


I believe that was a threat.


The reason I am asking you to continue this is because of the need for this to be digested by the public for the public’s consumption so that you can receive input back and then you can give that input to the Board’s committee of the Board of Supervisors who supposedly originated this.




Eric Coleman




Supports the continuance




Alice Barkley




I support the continuance.




Judy Berkowitz




I too support the continuance.




 


PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ITEM
:


 


Bernie Choden




This is an abrogation of the Planning Commission’s duties.
 
  Changing the Planning Code so it is all one fabric is more professional of the planning activity.


If in fact there is a concern that it stays with the Board of Supervisors, there is much illegality to be concerned with.


The question of impact fees, a problem with inverse condemnation.
 
  That is very technical.


Under the new text fees can be levied both on existing as well as proposed development.


That can cause hardship and much need to have some process in regard to both harm we cause and paying out for that, as well as collecting fees from people who profit as a result of the public action of the public interest


There needs to be some oversight in terms of legal due process that needs to be done.




Lois Scott, Vice President of the Planners Chapter of Local 21




We believe that the 24-month limit is not going to be workable.
 
  In our experience it takes longer.


We were very concerned that the compressed time schedule not be used as an excuse for not having the Planning staff do it, but having outside consultants do it.


My third comment is much more favorable in that the funding mechanism of considering funding the environmental review work along with a part of the Better Neighborhoods project funding is a very good idea.
 
  We think this idea should be extended to all the work that Citywide Planning does.




Ellen Kernigan




In spite of the contentions of the authors of the ordinance before you, it is evident that it truly is not necessary to replace the Planning Code with this suggestion to the Administrative Code.


The Planning Department staff report of July 28, 2005 and the Housing Inventory Report of 2004 are two excellent proofs that were cited to you in September.


The necessity for this proposal is clearly that of the originators.
 
  That is to abrogate the power of the Planning Commission and the public power lieutenants in order to allow developers with the Planning Department to fulfill their view of San Francisco’s future.
 
 A future that is first and foremost profit motivated without regard to the community at large to not only foot the bill, but to have to live with the results ever after.




Penelope Clark




I’m here to speak about the first draft of the current draft that regards changes to the Planning Code.


This proposed ordinance will now enable the Better Neighborhoods programs to move into older fully developed neighborhoods, which is going to cause great difficulties for those who already live there.


If developers feel the process is too slow, it is frequently because they do not try to analyze and modify in advance the negative effects their projects may have with them on their neighbors and on the character of the neighborhood—which will result in DR’s being filed against their projects.




Hiroshi Fakuda




If you go back to the original proposed ordinance, many people believe that we had three Better Neighborhood Plans in the past, which have been implemented and with some deal of success and that were done without any change in the Planning Codes.


So why do we need this?


Has the Planning Department made a study to let us know why we need this?




Robert Herman




Speaking on behalf of the San Francisco Public Policy Committee of the AIA


We have reviewed the proposed draft for Better Neighborhoods planning and implementation process dated October 24 and found it better than the earlier draft due to the following changes:


The Plan Implementation Advisory Committee authority would now be limited to reviewing and advising changes to the state of the neighborhood reports provided by the Planning Department staff rather than reviewing individual projects within the plan area


This prevents the drain on Planning Commission authority over project reviews and strengthens the certainty of the provisions of the Neighborhood Plan.


Limiting the reduction of the building envelope of proposed projects to 5% under discretionary review procedures without eliminating affordable family size units ensures greater predictability for project sponsors and respects the intent of the neighborhood plans’ guidelines on height, bulk, and density.




Peter Cohen




Speaking as an advocate for the legislation.


I’ve been involved helping to draft this and working with the City and the Supervisors’ Office and many folks in this room for many months.


There are six neighborhood plans currently underway with varying degrees of success as well as problems


I think there is a need for consistency in our planning standards.


That is what really seems to be the immediate urgency as well as projecting forward how the City is going to continue to do neighborhood planning in the future.


This is really a package of good planning standards to try to achieve that consistency.




Tim Coleman, Housing Action Coalition




What is this legislation in response to that started over two years ago?


It came out of the ashes of the Prop A Housing bond when it was recognized that the City is not producing the housing it needs and in particular, affordable housing.




Judy Berkowitz, San Francisco Coalitions for Neighborhoods




I draw your attention to [the fact that] there are still no findings.


We don’t know why we need this legislation.


Unfortunately, there is a downplay to CEQA.


I urge you to please send this to the Board with a negative recommendation.


One of the authors at this meeting even bemoaned the fact that the legislation had been taken over by, “downtown.”


The process was deficient from the beginning.
 
  No neighborhood activists were in on it.




Alice Barkley




You are in a catch 22 situation and I would suggest you do this:


Page one through line 19 of the ordinance is totally out of your hands.


No matter what you do or say, nothing will be referred to you because it is not part of the Planning Code.


I suggest that you recommend whatever you want to—no action or no recommendation—on the original legislation referred to you dated April, whatever day, 2005.


And that you make absolutely no comment on the amended version that has not yet been introduced.


When the amendment is introduced at the Land Use Committee, the public can ask the whole legislation to be referred based on that new amendment to you because that section is solidly within your jurisdiction.


That means that the resolution before you has to be changed.




John Bardis




You have been given ample testimony that you had a deficient process.


Where is the evidence of any communication from the sponsor of the legislation to this commission that any amendments that have been made to the legislation that was originally referred to the Board?


I would really be surprised how the City Attorney could be saying to you and advising you that you have before you legislation that has amendments that have been properly put before this City legislative process through the Board and then properly communicated to you.


You don’t even have before you anything from the supervisor saying this is what he wanted.


It came out of thin air.


It didn’t come from the Department.


It didn’t come from some body of evidence and these are the alternatives we considered and this is the best alternative and this is why it is the best alternative.


You have nothing like that in your case file that was given to you for review.


How can you possibly be making a decision, except out of thin air like it was created?




Fernando Marti




I’m here to ask that you recommend this legislation to move forward to the Board of Supervisors.


I am one of the people that was involved in working with supervisor McGoldrick in helping to create the original legislation


We’ve been working on this for over two years.


One of the things I want to reiterate is the urgency of moving forward with this.


This legislation was begun by community members on the east side of the city, east side, south of Market, Potrero Hill, Central Waterfront


Various folks from those neighborhoods are extremely concerned about the way and speed that planning is taking place in those neighborhoods.


In particular with the rezoning and how we might be able to shape community benefits out of that.


That was the initial impetus for creating this legislation and for creating a way of mandating good community planning by taking the best things out of the Better Neighborhoods, taking some of the ideas out of Rincon Hill – public benefits that came out of that.


From the very beginning of the planning process we need to look at how we are going to pay for infrastructure, how we’re going to pay for housing.
 
  Those things need to be incorporated into plans.


That is why we in the Mission and the Dogpatch, Central Waterfront really began to put this together.
 
  It is why we approached Supervisor McGoldrick, Supervisor Maxwell, supervisor Mirkarimi and really crafted something we think has really brought together a lot of the folks that will be affected in those Eastern neighborhoods and in the rezonings that are happening right now.




Jeffrey Leibovitz




I live in the eastern SOMA and I wasn’t invited to participate.


I’ve had an opportunity to review the legislation and I do believe that there are some good things in it.


I’ve got some substantive changes I’d like in here and I don’t understand why we can’t incorporate them.


[This legislation] called out for specific exemptions to several neighborhoods that have gone through community planning for the last four, five, six, seven, eight years.


Why can’t the Eastern SOMA be incorporated into those exemptions so we can get on the process?


When we began this, it was simple zoning controls to allow us to coexist with some pretty wild, wild west zoning in South Beach.


The Special Use District that was created so that our new emerging neighborhood could exist and it’s flourished – and it has worked.


So why do we have to mire ourselves down in this entire process?


Please exempt us from the Better Neighborhoods process.




Stephen Battle
.




This whole process started two years ago when there was another piece of legislation introduced by Supervisor McGoldrick that was call Public Benefit Zoning that was completely unworkable.


After he withdrew it he convened a group of people to come up with an alternative.
 
  I was one of the people that was involved on and off over the last two years in that drafting group.


I don’t think the legislation is perfect.
 
  What it is is a compromise that gives and takes away and it has reached a balance that I think is appropriate and I think will work.


I think the process tonight has been unfortunate because you didn’t get these amendments until last Friday and the form you got them in was not a red line version so it is very difficult to tell what they are.


I also think it was unfortunate that you didn’t get a staff report or recommendation to go through the amendments that were made.


I think pages 2 to 5 contain the substance of the amendments that have been put forth by Supervisor McGoldrick and the working group.


I would urge you to look at those changes.


I think those changes are all positive.

I
I think the most important thing about this legislation is that you as the Commission are created by Charter.
 
  The Charter’s permits and licenses are dependent on the Planning Code and administered by the Planning Department, which shall be approved by the Commission.


The Commission may delegate disapproval for the Planning Department.


You can’t delegate your hearing responsibilities, your approval responsibilities.


There should be no body of citizens sitting between the community and you.


They’ve taken it out of the public forum and given you amendments formally presented and you don’t know that to do with them.


I ask that you please make a statement to the supervisor saying that you want the 90 days that the code gives you after modifications have been made to a piece of legislation that’s come before you.




 


ACTION:
          
  Direct the Planning Director to confer with the maker of the legislation, Supervisor McGoldrick, to explore establishing a pilot program for an area to be initially agreed upon, to test out the elements in the legislation, and that in the meantime the Board of Supervisors does not take action on the legislation while we test it out.

PUBLIC COMMENT


 


At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.
 
 With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.
 
 When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.
 
 Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.


 


The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.
 
 In response to public comment, the commission is limited to:


 


(1) Responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or


(2) Requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or


(3) Directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.
 
 (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))


 


           
  SPEAKERS:


           
  
Jeffrey Leibovitz, Eastern SOMA




We are very supportive of the recommendations and very thoughtful deliberations by the Commission tonight on [Supervisor McGoldrick’s legislation].


I think you are headed in the right direction and I think that all of us will benefit from it


The legislation proposed is important and has some extremely good proposals in it.


It was just the process of where we got to and how we got to it that was very troublesome.




Judy Berkowtiz




I address you tonight on SFGTV, Channel 26.


For several weeks you have not been simultaneously broadcast live on Thursday evenings.


There were five reruns of different Boards and Commissions that they put on instead of you.


I believe this is deliberate.


If you could perhaps take some action with SFGTV next to the Elections Department in the basement of City Hall, I would appreciate it.




John Bardis




Criticism of the Department regarding the processing of applications.


Currently the process allows an application to come in and the planner to negotiate back and forth with the applicant.


That should not be allowed.


The application should come in through the door; not be changed; be reviewed and either packed out or moved forward.


There should not be any negotiation taking place.


If you did that, you would have a problem then with what you are going to do with the time of your staff.


It may be that then long-range planning will have some time to be done in the city.
