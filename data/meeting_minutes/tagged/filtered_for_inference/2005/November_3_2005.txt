COMMISSIONERS’ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS

 Commission Comments/Questions


Commissioner Antonini:
 
 
I have a couple of questions.
 
 One is on one of the items that is being continued—The Great Highway.
 
 I have been informed that this general review exemption occurred in June of 2004, which means we are now approximately 18 months from the time of the exemption.
 
 So one would believe that if someone had a problem with it they would have filed an appeal before now.
 
 I think we have a problem--one that has to be dealt with at the State level.
 
 I don’t know if the city can do anything to limit the appeal period on these type of things—both negative declarations and categorical exemptions of environmental review—because it clearly does not seem to be used properly.
 
 It may only be a tactic to delay.
 
 I’m not saying that is the case here, but it seems very odd that this appeal would be done at such a late time.
 
 I think this has happened many, many times.
 
 This is something I would like to see if there is any jurisdiction we have or if it has to be done on a State level.


 


Kate Stacey, Deputy City Attorney responded:
 
 
Commissioner Antonini is correct in that the state law, CEQA, requires appeals of categorical exemptions and other determinations as well as negative declarations to the elected legislative body.
 
 In our case this body is the Board of Supervisors.
 
 The City has not adopted any procedures or time limits within which those appeals have to take place and how they have to take place.
 
 So our office has advised that as long as threw is still an outstanding permit for the city to review and consider approval of, that those appeals are timely because the CEQA determination is linked to the approval itself.
 
 As long as the city still has some discretionary approval, we would like the clerk of the Board to consider the appeal of those timely.


 


Commissioner Antonini:
 
 
To change that, you’re saying that it does have to be at a State level?


 


Kate Stacey, Deputy City Attorney responded
:
 
 Commissioner Antonini, the Board has to adopt procedures for the appeal of exemptions and negative declarations.
 
 It has not done so.
 
 …The Clerk of the Board has adopted some procedural rules for how those appeals occur.
 
 But there are no time limits within which an appeal must occur.


 


Commissioner Antonini:
 
 So what body of the city would have power to do that sort of thing?


 


Kate Stacey, Deputy City Attorney
:
 
 The Board of Supervisors enacts amendments to the Administrative Code—to Chapter 31.


 


Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator also responded:
 
 Commissioners, the department has urged the Board of Supervisors to take this up.
 
 The department has indicated, or I have indicated myself, that I was going to introduce or have the department introduce an ordinance that would do that.
 
 I got a distinctly negative reaction.
 
 It does not seem like this Board is pursuing this issue.


 


Commissioner Antonini
:
 
 Thank you.
 
 My other comment deals with…


It has been called to my attention by a couple of people that they read in the 
West Portal Monthly
 a paraphrase of some remarks I made.
 
 It was not a direct quote.
 
 When you paraphrase, oftentimes, you don’t get the meaning of what was really said.
 
 I know the author.
 
 She does a wonderful job and I appreciate her articles very much.
 
 But I did not say that West Portal was no longer a viable retail corridor as was mentioned there.
 
 It’s a very viable retail corridor.
 
 It’s one of the most viable in the city.


 


 
 There was a reference also made to Stonestown.
 
 I think that they do have somewhat of a unique situation because certain retail outlets that might occur in other streets, such as Fillmore, Chestnut, even Haight, such as the Gap or Pottery Barn or others, would not locate there because they are right close to Stonestown.
 
 In that regard, you’re a little more limited in the type of retail that will come in.
 
 I think that was the nature of my comments.


 


I also mentioned some other streets are evolving.
 
 You’ve seen 24
th
 Street had a ban on new restaurants for many years and they’ve now decided that no longer applies.
 
 I don’t know what the people in West Portal feel about financial institutions.
 
 I certainly was supportive of their objections in the ‘70s and ‘80s on the basis that there were too many of those institutions that not only proliferates but also proliferates architecturally.
 
 I don’t think the best land use (as we look at it today) could be on single floor large parking lots.
 
 Historically, it’s been two or three floors.
 
 In that regard—just on an architectural basis—it’s something I hope they look at in the future regardless of what position is taken on the overall issue of the financial institutions themselves.
 


 


Finally, in regard to that, I did mention that Broderick Place over on Fell Street which we had approved was sort of a real model of what could possibly be done in a lot of these areas where you’re taking a bank in a parking lot and turning it into a market, a smaller bank, housing, parking and retail.
 
 I’m anxious to see that project finished because it may serve as a model for some of the residential streets in the future.


 


Commissioner Olague:
 
 Peter Cohen was mentioning the Backstreet Advisory Board he was on.
 
 I’d like to understand where they are.
 
 What the deliberations and what some of there findings might be and how it relates to what we are deliberating on in the Eastern Neighborhoods.
 
 I don’t know where the best place for that would be.

 Director’s Announcements


Dean Macris, Director of Planning:
 
 
Next week is a short calendar and we’ll be bringing a number of items for updates.
 
 The first is Green Buildings.
 
 We’ve also been talking about Dwelling Unit mergers, First Source Advisory and City Build.


 


Last week you approved 410 Jessie Street.
 
 Ms. Hester questioned whether the transit impact development fee was applicable and if paid.
 
 She believed the sponsor—I believe the word she used was—had cheated the city out of owed fees.
 
 I think you’ve received emails from Mr. Yarnee documenting the Muni’ exemption of this in a letter dated I think 1/7/05.
 
 Met with Mr. Banks today.
 
 The materials [he] presented at our meeting allowed me to confirm the 1999 launch project of this site as not subject to the Transit Impact Development Fee.
 
 Although the proposed and approved new building configuration includes office use, the square footages at the previous use provides a credit larger than the office portion.
 
 I think there is pretty extensive information here demonstrating compliance with the Transit Impact Development Fee.

 Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals


 


BOS – (Dan Sider reporting)




Home Depot was continued again to next week.
 
 It will appear on the 11/8/05 calendar.
 
 It will be the third time calendared.


Supervisor Maxwell’s proposal—Visitacion Valley General Plan Amendment and Impact Fees—was passed unanimously at the Board this week on first reading.


Supervisor Mirkarimi introduced a proposal for rezoning of certain parcels along the Haight Street corridor to Stein and Pierce Streets to an NC-2, small scale neighborhood commercial classification.
 
 We will bring this to you in the coming months for your review.




 


Commissioner Olague:
 
 As far as the Visitacion Valley fees are concerned, was there any discussion regarding Bayview?


 


Dan Sider:
 
 There was some discussion at the Committee level.
 
 It is my understanding that there was not a level of discussion at the full Board on Tuesday.


 


BOA – (Jonas Ionin reporting)




586 Lisbon Street, a project that was subject to the mandatory demolition policy.
 
 Collin O’Neill, the project sponsor appealed your decision.
 
 I believe the demo wasn’t so much of an issue before the Commission as much as the new construction.
 
 There were some dimension problems and reduction of plans that were illegible and the project was disapproved.
 
 The sponsor hired a new architect, modified the project that satisfied the department.
 
 The Board of Appeals then overturned your decision approving the demolition and new construction permit applications.


567 Sanchez Street:
 
 There were three discretionary reviews before you.
 
 This had been appealed to the Board a couple of times, and last night was the third hearing. 
 
 The appeal was related to the agreement that was ratified by the Commission by taking DR and adopting all those conditions of approval.
 
 There was a motion to overturn your disapproval and allow three of the minor modifications.
 
 However, that motion failed 3 to 2.
 
 In that motions failing, the Board upheld your disapproval.




 


D.
        
 GENERAL
 
PUBLIC COMMENT – 15 MINUTES


 


At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.
 
 With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting.
 
 Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.


 


Jim Salinas
:
 
 
RE:
 
 To commend Commissioner Olague and the entire panel.




I’ve watched this panel come together around different land use issues, but most especially the fact that San Franciscans be allowed to go to work.
 


I think that this panel has shown itself to address those benefits that directly affect the entire community of San Francisco.
 


I have watched City Build, which is in its infancy stages.
 
 If City Build is what it currently is and what it could be in a year or two, I think this Mayor has come up with on heck of an idea and it’s already affecting a lot of San Franciscans.


I believe that young San Franciscans, especially in the black and brown community be given opportunities where they might not have one if it were not for programs like City Build.


You have a lot of work in from of you, a great responsibility, a great charge, all of which you do with a passion.


I’ve watched a lot of young brothers and sisters on a daily basis and the only hope some have is at the end of a bullet.
 
 But you’ve changed that and I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for that passion.




 


Sue Hester:
 
 RE:
 
 Some suggestions




– The way to solve this problem is to give the public notice that one exists.
 
 For example, when a Section 311 notice is issued, there is a legend at the bottom of it saying there is an environmental document available on this project and tell them where they can get a copy of it.


Conflict of Interest
 
– In light of the newspaper article last Friday and Saturday about the former Planning Director, I think maybe it’s time for the Commission and staff to think about whether there needs to be a more robust training on this across the board on such things as what is the radius whereby you have a conflict.
 
 Maybe the City Attorney needs to think with you on this.




 


Joe O’Donaghue:
 
 RE:
 
 Contractors avoiding going through the planning process




When they fill out applications, they lie at the counter.
 
 As a result, they never come to the Planning Department.


The Director of the Bureau of Building Inspection stated in her application that she has four floors of occupancy in her building.
 
 It only has two.
 
 Her application avoided coming to the planning process.
 
 Her permits were given out in record time.




 




CONSENT CALENDAR




 


All matters listed hereunder constitute a Consent Calendar, are considered to be routine by the Planning Commission, and will be acted upon by a single roll call vote of the Commission.
 
 There will be no separate discussion of these items unless a member of the Commission, the public, or staff so requests, in which event the matter shall be removed from the Consent Calendar and considered as a separate item at this or a future hearing.

I’m a resident of the immediate area.


I have met with the developer many times


He has addressed all of our neighborhood concerns and I’m in full support of this project




John Victor




I live across the street from this project


The west side of the block is light industrial.


One of our concerns is that light industrial is changing.


We would love to see the kind of housing on the other side of the street—keeping with the neighborhood


The architects met with us several times.
 
 I’m concerned about the height restrictions across the street.
 
 Our building is about 25 feet high and this building directly across the street from us will be 40 feet high.


I’d love to see more ownership possibility there.


I guess I’m not giving it my full approval and I’m not saying it’s bad either.

Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions.


 


SPEAKERS:


Sue Hester
:




We have a rezoning process that is now four years into the process and all we have at this point for the Mission is a map that syas housing, PDR, mixed use, et cetera.
 
 This is not planning a neighborhood.


We in the Mission and Potrero Hill want neighborhoods developed.


You do not have a discussion on what makes this industrial part of the Mission a neighborhood.


All you have from staff is, it’s supposed to be housing.


What makes a neighborhood our of an area like this?


When the Commission approved most of Harrison Street as live/work, and as you’re filling up all the rest of this with housing, you really should be looking at what is a neighborhood.
 
 It’s what we’re entitled to.




George House, Representing the Project Sponsor




The project will provide 6 to 8 units of housing on the west side of Harrison Street


It is in compliance with section 315 of the planning code.


It provides the required 12% BMR (below market rate) units.


This project was conceived through a collaborative process between the public and the project team.
 
 This process literally formed this building in terms of its massing, the layout, parking, unit mix, scale and the aesthetics


He gave a description and overview of the project design.

 of Building Permit Application No. 2005.03.17.7771, proposing to remove the existing extension and deck at the rear of the single-family dwelling and to construct a new three-story addition and deck with stair projecting four feet deeper into the rear yard than the existing deck, in an RH-1 (Residential, House, One-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project.


 


SPEAKERS:


Ron Konapaski




I’ve lived in the house next door to this project for the last 36 years and this has a very negative impact on our property.


We attempted to work with the neighbors in making some modifications to this but they basically stonewalled us.


I am concerned with the potential illegal living space in the basement


I am also concerned with the size of the addition in terms of bulk and protrusion into the backyard.


And finally, I’m concerned with the fact that it is so close to our deck.


It is also out of character for the neighborhood inasmuch as it goes up three stories.




Darren McMurtry, Project Architect




I suppose the main thing to point out is that the DR requestors’ addition is similar to the bulk and mass of ours—his is three stories, ours is three stories.
 
 His goes out 12 feet, ours goes out 12 feet.
 
 I think ours definitely fits within the fabric of this neighborhood.


He gave an overall description of the project design and layout.

Mandatory Discretionary Review
, under the Planning Commission’s policy requiring review of dwelling unit mergers, of Building Permit Application No. 2004.04.13.1119, proposing to convert the building’s authorized use from four units to a single-family dwelling with two kitchens, in an RH-3 (Residential, House, Three-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Take Discretionary Review and disapprove the building permit application as submitted.


 


SPEAKERS:


Jeremy Paul, Representing the Project Sponsor




When the owners bought the building, the #R report said the building was unknown probably because the permit records were missing.
 
 They knew it needed a lot of work but could be ideal for the type of living arrangement they sought for their community and their extended family—their modern family.


He gave a detailed presentation of the project’s current and proposed design and layout.




Stefan Smith, One of the owners of the project




When he and Mr. Stanley found this building 11 years ago, it was a mess inside and out, but I saw right away that it was an opportunity to have a home for several of us to live as a community or as a family.


We’ve put a lot of work in it in the beginning and have been saving a long time to finish restoring the building to the home that it originally was.




Stanley Eng, One of the owners of the project




Since 1994 we have lived in the house as a community—as a family.


I’ve known Stefan for over 25 years.
 
 We have been best friends.


We see this as a house, always will and always will.


If this was ever required to return to three units or four units of five units, I think we would have no choice but to move out because it would render it a place not suitable for our use.




Norman, A resident of 46 Alpine Terrace




I cannot imagine how this house could ever be made into the kind of multiple units that are being described in some fictional way


This is a very livable place and I’m happy there


I’m retired and on a fixed income.
 
 It’s one of the few places I’ve found in San Francisco that I could afford as well as be in a very stimulating community


I trust that the Commission will see it this way and will approve this.

Mandatory Discretionary Review
, under the Planning Commission's policy on 
     
 dwelling unit mergers, of Building Permit Application No. 2005.07.22.8371, to convert three dwelling units to two. The project would merge an existing unit at the first floor and a one-bedroom unit that occupies the remainder of the first floor and entire second floor of the structure. The subject property is within an RH-3 (Residential, House, Three-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and disapprove the


application.


 


SPEAKERS:


Cornelia Griffin, Representative of the Project Sponsor




City Planning approved the removal of this unit in the year 2000 and if the contractor had done a final signoff on it, none of us would be here today.


The previous owner lived in the house thinking that it had been converted to a two-unit building.


He described the current conditions of the project site.


My clients bought the house with the intention of living there and raising a family there, which is exceedingly difficult to do in a one bedroom home.


I’d hate to see them have to rent this unit out and not have the room for their children and leave the city because they don’t have a second bedroom.


The unit has been empty for five years and has not been part of the housing stock for that long.
 
 No one has been dispossessed.
 
 No one has been moved out.




Dave McGreger, Building Owner




We would like to change it from three units to two units in oder to have a practical and appropriate single-family home.


My wife and I recently married and plan on starting a family.
 
 We would like to incorporate this efficiency apartment to give us a safe usable second bedroom.


We have a rental unit downstairs on the first floor that we have rented to a very nice young woman and intend to keep that on the market.


We both work in the city and would very much like to stay in the city and raise our family here.
