- There is a very big systemic problem.


Lois Scott – Planners Chapter of Local 21

- Skills in working with labor organizations would be very important.


 


Nilka Julio – Local 21


Re:
 
 Hiring Process


- It is important to work collaboratively with DHR in order to hire professional planners.


- The most important thing that the Commission will face is the hiring of a new director.

- San Francisco is a very important place to be.


- A visionary is very important.

Re:
 
  1919 22
nd
 Street


John Lum – John Lum Architecture


- He has been working with the Discretionary Review applicant for the past five months.


- The issue that has not been resolved is the condition that the DR applicant wanted imposed on the project sponsor--that she could not have any more construction ever.
 
  This is not feasible for the project sponsor.


- There were some concerns about neighborhood character as well.
 
  He is very familiar with the neighborhood guidelines since he was part of the making of the document.
 
 He feels that the design of the building is in conformity with the guidelines.


Crispin Barker


- He asked that the property be kept within the guidelines.


- He asked that the design of the project be of a contemporary design style.


- He met with the neighbors who expressed some concern about the project but he was able to solve their issues.


- He respects the neighbor’s rights about giving their opinion about his project, but he asked the Commission to take consideration about his right to renovate his property.


Kris Gardner


- She presented the material of the Discretionary Review requestor because she is not able to attend the hearing.


- Basically the issue relates to open space.


- She presented another piece of material from a neighbor who is also opposed to the project because of open space.


Dorothy Larson


- She lives next door to the proposed project.


- She is concerned with the setback.
 
  This setback should be more in conformity with the other houses.


- She is also concerned with open space, the height of the building, etc.


 


Re:
 
  1886 Mission Street


Brett Gladstone


- The Commission should have more time to review the findings.


- The public has not had time to review comments either.


- He would like to have some further discussions with the City Attorney.


- He would appreciate a two-week continuance to review and comment on the issues.


Kate White


- This project does not need a full EIR.


- She hopes that the Commission looks at the real issue, the facts, and forget about the politics.


Bart James – Carpenter’s Union


- This project should be torn down.
 
  It is a skeleton and could fall at any time.


Azalia Merrill – Carpenter’s Union


- This building is an old building.


- She has done a lot of research on this project.


- There is nothing particularly special about this building.


- This building is corrupting the neighborhood and it is not contributing to it at all.

Robert Pentel


- Since the onset of this project, there have been constant negotiations.


- They are within “inches” of coming to a final resolution.


- They had expected to sign all the drawings by last evening.


- Unfortunately the firm that they have is the same as the one the project sponsors have.
 
  That would be a conflict of interest.


Jeremy Paul


- He agrees with the previous speaker.


- Unfortunately there have been some delays to get a document stating the withdrawal of the Discretionary Review.
 


- A one week continuance would be adequate.

Preliminary Recommendation:
 
  Take Discretionary Review and approve the project with modifications


 


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Nancy Denney Phelps – Discretionary Review Requestor


- She recommended that the project sponsor just make one floor addition to their project.


- It would have been nice for the project sponsor to come to explain their project to her and at that time they would have been able to discuss the issues they have.
 
  This would have saved time and money.


- The rear addition would set a precedent and would alter the character of the neighborhood.


- She is very concerned with the height and bulk of the building.


- There are various neighbors who oppose the project.


(-) Nick Phelps


- He displayed various diagrams showing the height and bulk of the structure; and ones that displayed how the height of the building would block the light and sun from the adjacent neighbors.


(-) Bick Jane Tang Tso


- She lives in the neighborhood and is opposed to the project.


- If sunlight is blocked to the rear of the property it will create a shadow on her garden.


- This will affect her property value.
 
  It will decrease it.


(+) C.J. Higley – Representing Project Sponsor


- The project sponsor has lived in the house for 19 years.


- Their children have been growing and their house has been getting smaller and smaller.


- The parents of the project sponsor are getting older and will be moving in with their children and grandchildren.


- These are the reasons for the expansion.
 
  They do not want to leave San Francisco.


- He realizes that the project will create some shadow to the adjacent neighbors.


(+) Kwan Lu – Project Sponsor


- He and his family want to stay in San Francisco.


- At one point he thought that there was an agreement with the Discretionary Review requestor but there was no agreement.


- The project will have little affect on the adjacent homes.


- He recently removed tall pines from his back yard because they were hazardous.
 
  This has provided a lot of sunlight to their neighbors.


- They just need more space and he hope that the Commission will approve their project.


 


ACTION:
          
  Hearing Held.
 
 Item continued to April 21, 2005 in order for Project Sponsor to hire an architect to present alternative designs and to continue to work with the neighborhood trying to reach an agreement on a design.

- Exemption of Certain Entertainment Permits from Conditional Use Process - 
Consideration of an Ordinance amending the San Francisco Planning Code by amending Section 715.48 and Section 721.48
 to provide that existing bars in the Castro Street and Upper Market Street Neighborhood Commercial Districts will be allowed to apply for and receive a place of entertainment permit from the Entertainment Commission without obtaining conditional use authorization from the Planning Commission if they can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Entertainment Commission that they have been in regular operation as an entertainment use prior to January 1, 2004; and making findings of consistency with the priority policies of Planning Code Section 101.1 and the General Plan.


Preliminary Recommendation: Adoption


 


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Amanda Kohn – Project Sponsor


- This legislation was brought from the Entertainment Commission to Supervisor Dufty’s Office.


(+) Bob Davis

566 South Van Ness Avenue
 
- 
Appeal of Preliminary Negative Declaration
 - The proposed project would include demolition of an existing 4,344 gross-square-foot, one-story retail/commercial building and rear storage building and construction of a five-story, 50-foot-tall mixed-use building which would contain 32 residential units on the second through fifth floors and retail/commercial use on the ground floor.
 
 The residential use would be 27,491 gross square feet (gsf) in area, and the retail/commercial space would be 4,344 gsf in size.
 
 The ground floor and basement levels would include 32 parking spaces designated for the residential use with ingress and egress from South Van Ness Avenue. The ground floor would contain the commercial space and residential lobby.
 
 The 12,253-square-foot site is located within the C-M (Heavy Commercial) zoning district and within a 50-X height and bulk district. The proposed project requires a conditional use authorization for residential use in the C-M district.
 


Preliminary Recommendation: Uphold Mitigated Negative Declaration


                       
  (Continued from Regular Meeting of February 24, 2005)


 


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Sue Hestor – Appellant


- She displayed a map of the area involving the NEMIZ.


- The Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition is concerned that there are housing projects being approved without really understanding anything.


- She displayed a summary of every housing live/work project since 1990.


- She displayed a map of the type of uses in the area surrounding the NEMIZ.


(+) Mathew Brennan


- This paint shop will be replaced with housing.


- The building on the site was the subject of a historic preservation report.


- There will be an increase of PDR for the space.


- The appellant seems to have the argument more with the Planning Department than with this project.


(+) Marge Benson


- This project could only have a positive impact on the neighborhood.


- The project is located where there is housing and PDR use.


- The PDR square footage is preserved and there will be 30+ units of median housing.


- The project sponsor has made numerous attempts to speak to the opposition but there has been no progress.


- She urged the Commission to approve this project.


(+) Joe O’Donoghue


- The appellant’s arguments are opposing policies and not necessarily related to the project.


- This is about an EIR and not about policy.

- The extra PDR space for the project will probably not be a PDR space but someone’s office.


- There are no truck spaces in the building.


- The project has a very strange configuration.


- Paint storage is hazardous material.

- Did Long-Term Planning look at this project?

Sue Hestor


Re:
 
  Housing


- There will be a workshop on housing shortly.


- Where is the land for affordable housing that was assigned in the Housing Element going to be built?


- Every time land is used for condos, this is not affordable housing.


- Staff does not track what is produced and what it is sold for so the Commission does not have an idea of what needs are being met.


- Staff needs to tell the Commission the details of housing projects.


- How will the decision that the Commission makes sorted out?


- Low-income people do reverse commutes.


Joe O’Donaghue


- The issue of where the land for housing is has been raised many times.


- The population today is less than in WWII.


- There is land in which to build but it has to be high density.


- It is possible to give more affordability via density bonuses.
