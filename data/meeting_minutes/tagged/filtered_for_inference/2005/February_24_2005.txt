          Preliminary Negative Declaration
 - The proposed project would include 
          demolition of an existing 4,344 gross-square-foot, one-story retail/commercial 
          building and rear storage building and construction of a five-story,

          on the second through fifth floors and retail/commercial use on the 
          ground floor. The residential use would be 27,491 gross square feet 
          (gsf) in area, and the retail/commercial space would be 4,344 gsf in 
          size. The ground floor and basement levels would include 32 parking 
          spaces designated for the residential use with ingress and egress from 
          South Van Ness Avenue. The ground floor would contain the commercial

6. Commission Comments/Questions




Commissioner Antonini:


Re: Article in the Newspaper


- The article raised a very interesting question 
          about 88 Townsend.


- How much of a building should be preserve and 
          how should an adjacent property be treated?


- This is a very good question.


Commissioner W. Lee:


Re: Fire Code


- He asked what the status is of an ordinance regarding 
          the fire code.


- When does the ordinance go into effect because 
          it will affect projects that the department is currently approving?




Zoning Administrator responded:


- He discussed this issue with the Building Department 
            and was told that it is an adopted ordinance and it is being implemented 
            right now.


- The title of the ordinance states: Self-contained 
            breathing replenishment systems on high rises where permits had been 
            issued after March 30, 2004.




Commissioner W. Lee:


- During the permit process, when is one required 
          to meet the fire code?




Zoning Administrator responded:


- The application should have been submitted after 
            March 30, 2004.


Interim Director Macris responded:


- There will be a coordination meeting with DBI 
            next Thursday so they will raise this question and report to the Commission 
            afterward.




Commissioner W. Lee:


Re: Density Bonuses


- If one builds for low income or very low income 
          are there higher density bonuses?


- He would like to receive information on this.




Interim Director Macris responded:


- He is inquiring with the City Attorney on the 
            recently acquired state law.




Commissioner Bradford Bell:


Re: Eastern Neighborhoods


- When this issue was before the Commission she 
          had some concerns about PDR matters and she knows that these concerns 
          are being address in a report being prepared.


- She is concerned that projects are being delayed 
          or that the viewpoint of Commissioners are not being considered.


- The Commission gave comments and direction on 
          what they wanted and what their concerns are. She feels that some of 
          the concerns are not being addressed or the information is not getting 
          a back to the Commission.


- The Commission's opinions should be respected 
          and both Commission and staff should work together.




Interim Director Macris responded:


- Staff is trying to respond to all the questions 
            and concerns that the Commission has.


- He welcomed Commissioner Bell to come to the 
            department for a briefing on the status of projects.


- It would be useful that on more than one occasion, 
            any member of the Commission can speak with him a few minutes before 
            the meeting starts to be briefed on any issue they would like to speak 
            on.




Commissioner Hughes:


Re: Planning Director Search


- He reminded staff to submit their questions regarding 
          the hiring of the new director.


Commissioner Olague:


Re: Housing Element and Emporium/Capwell


- She wants to know what the status of these issues 
          are.


Commissioner W. Lee:


Re: Performance of the Commission


- He requested that Interim Director Macris send 
          to staff a questionnaire on how they feel the Commission has been working 
          so far and any issue that might be of interest to them regarding the 
          performance of the Commission.


Commissioner Antonini:


- He agrees with Commissioner W. Lee and encouraged 
          staff to do that.


Commissioner Bradford Bell:


- She feels the same way as Commissioner W. Lee 
          and Antonini.


- It is important to work together and communicate.

PUBLIC COMMENT - 15 MINUTES




At this time, members of the public may address the 
      Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject 
      matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items. With respect 
      to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded 
      when the item is reached in the meeting. Each member of the public may address 
      the Commission for up to three minutes.


John McMahan


Re: Newspaper Article


- He has lived in San Francisco for many years.


- He read an article from John King of the San Francisco 
      Chronicle called "Insulting Historic Preservation" related to 
      a trend called "facadism" where, in the quest to hold on to the 
      past, parts of the existing building is retained and a new contraction is 
      done behind it.


Jim Salinas


Re: Affordable Housing


- He is concerned about the current situation at the 
      Commission.


- He feels very strongly that the Commission has done 
      positive things for San Francisco.


- The greatest responsibility that the Commission has 
      right now is to create housing.


- All of the objectives and goals can be achieved.


Azalia Merrill


Re: Affordable Housing


- She grows weary of San Franciscans being forced out 
      of the City. There is no housing crisis. There is an affordable housing 
      crisis.


- There are truly remarkable buildings in San Francisco 
      that could be preserved.


- The Commission should look at buildings that could 
      provide affordable housing.


Marilyn Amini


Re: Items on the Calendar


- There are two items on the calendar that involve planning 
      code amendments.


- Both of these items should have an intent to initiate. 
      The community needs to be advised and the public available to comment.


- The current procedures in the administrative code 
      have no provisions for general rule exclusion assignments.




E. PUBLIC COMMENT ON AGENDA ITEMS WHERE THE PUBLIC 
    HEARING HAS BEEN CLOSED




At this time, members of the public who wish to address 
      the Commission on agenda items that have already been reviewed in a public 
      hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the public 
      hearing has been closed, must do so at this time. Each member of the public 
      may address the Commission for up to three minutes.


Re: 1517 Irving Street


Jeremy Paul


- He is looking forward to hearing the demolition policy.


- He attempted to reach the neighbors involved in this 
      case but was unsuccessful.


- As much housing as possible on this site should be 
      allowed.


- He encourages the Commission to support a new building 
      at this site.


Pat Buscovich


- Staff believes that mold should not be included in 
      a demolition evaluation.


- There was a fire in the building a few years ago.


- Instead of taking out the walls, particleboards was 
      glued to the walls. When these particleboards were removed, there were extreme 
      levels of mold.


- The mold at this house will affect the quality of 
      living.


Gabriel Ng - Project Architect


- He presented a shadow study to the neighbors.


- He displayed a sketch of the proposed new construction.


- He has tried to keep everyone involved in this project 
      happy.


Re: 605 Kearny Street


Erin Crucz - S. F. Architectural Heritage


- 
She was concerned with the height, the setback, 
      floor plates, etc.


- They have meet with the project sponsor twice and 
      were very pleased with the outcome of the meetings.


- There has been a new proposal that should eliminate 
      a setback.


- She asked the Commission to approve the proposal that 
      includes the setback and the masonry stucco materials.


Re: 1234 Howard Street


Cesar Moreno - San Francisco Housing Action Coalition


- The Housing Coalition endorses this site because it 
      will provide much needed housing.


- The project also provides a very sensitive way to 
      complement the surrounding neighborhood.


- He submitted a letter of endorsement regarding the 
      project.

Appeal of Inner 
          Mission North survey findings
 - Following the Landmarks Boards' 
          Public Review Process for Cultural Resource Survey findings, the Planning 
          Commission must review written objections to the Inner Mission North 
          Cultural Resource Survey Phase II (California Department of Parks and 
          Recreation Survey Forms - DPR 523A and 523B) survey findings as presented 
          by property owner. The Commission is requested to evaluate the owner's 
          objection to the proposed California Historic Resources Status Code 
          (CHRSC) assigned to the property at 1886 Mission Street. It should consider 
          and adopt a resolution to either: 1) endorse the evaluation and the 
          CHRSC rating that found the property to be individually eligible for 
          the California Register (3CS), 
or
 2) determine, based on historical 
          evidence and evaluation criteria, an alternate CHRSC status code.


Preliminary Recommendation: Adopt a resolution upholding 
          the evaluation and Status Code of 3CS as recommended by the Landmark's 
          Board.








NOTE: On February 17, 2005, following testimony, 
                the Commission passed a motion of intent to not endorse the CHRSC 
                rating of 3CS and determined an alternate rating of 6L by a vote 
                +4-2. Commissioners Alexander and Sue Lee voted no. Commissioner

BRIEFING ON THE POLICY REQUIRING DISCRETIONARY 
          REVIEW OF RESIDENTIAL
 
DEMOLITIONS
 - A presentation outlining 
          the Planning Commission's current "Temporary Policy" for Mandatory 
          Discretionary Review of Dwellings proposed for demolition, and the criteria 
          it comprises, a discussion of the efficacy and effects of the policy, 
          and preliminary recommendations for revised elements to be adopted in 
          the future as a long term policy, following a two-month period of review 
          and public comment.


Preliminary Recommendation: Informational presentation 
          - no action to be taken


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Pat Buscovich


- He made some comments and submitted them to the 
          Commission regarding this being a good idea to have Discretionary Reviews 
          that involve demolitions and new constructions.


- The different type of projects should be very 
          distinct.


- It is very important for the Commission to exercise 
          their discretion on the quality of the house.


- There are two different types of mold. Sometimes 
          there is mold because of defective construction.


- Retaining walls should be included since they 
          are part of the building.


- There should be a demolition impact fee because 
          there are developers that are demolishing houses and replacing them 
          with giant houses.


- Staff should hire him as the consultant instead 
          of individual project applicants.


(+) Jeremy Paul


- It is important for the Commission to study what 
          this policy has done to the process.


- He does not like it when clients come to him masquerading 
          projects.


- The impact on the housing stock is not a good 
          one.


- He congratulated staff on their work, but there 
          are still some items that need to be analyzed.


(+) Jim Salinas


- He commended staff for this sound and solid report.


- Many demolitions were approved previously.


- He has seen soundness reports that are not very 
          reliable.


(+) Azalea Merrill


- There should be safeguards that will state when 
          or how a particular house should be demolished.


- The Commission should keep hold of affordable 
          housing.


(+) Sue Hestor


- She could tell from the demolition report if there 
          will be a lot of problems


- Eliminating the engineers/contractors that are 
          being hired by developers is a good idea.


- There are many projects that are overturned at 
          the Board of Appeals.


- The Board of Appeals should not undermine the 
          policy.


(+) Alice Barkley


- The Board of Appeal has on staff two architects 
          so the Board itself has its on expertise for evaluating buildings and 
          reports related to demolition.


- There are problems with the policy: it doesn't 
          address facades. If the facade of a certain building is ugly and the 
          project sponsor wants it replaced.


- Older buildings should have the garage level raised.


- There are various items that still need to be 
          looked at related to defacto demolitions.


- In the new policy there should be some leeway 
          to look at these types of projects carefully.


(+) Joe Butler


- The City's smallest houses are the most vulnerable.


- People with low or moderate incomes should be 
          allowed to bid on small homes.


- Promises are made to the Commission that are never 
          set forward.


ACTION: Informational only. No Action Required by 
          the Commission

Request for a Conditional Use
 authorization by Holy Family

          previously approved Conditional Use authorization. The previously approved 
          Conditional Use authorization (Case No. 1997.823CE) was for the construction 
          of a two-story childcare facility serving approximately 150 children. 
          The new proposal is for the construction of a three-story childcare 
          facility with the same number of children. The property is in the RM-1 
          (Residential, Mixed, Low Density) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk 
          District. 










Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions










SPEAKER(S):


(+) Donna Cahill


- She is honored to work for an organization that 
          provides early education.


- They provide an array of services to the community.


- The new building is important for the long-term 
          success of their programs.


- Early education requires enhancement of the environment. 
          Having a new facility would contribute to this.


(+) Kass Smith - Project Architect


- He gave an architectural review of the site.


(+/-) David Scott - Dolores Plaza Homeowners 
          Association


- They are adjacent to the proposed site.


- They are pleased to be part of the neighborhood.


- They are concerned that with an increased number 
          of children, the playground area would be noisier. They would appreciate 
          it if the project sponsor would find a way to reduce the noise.


- There is a parking issue in the area already. 
          The planning for this facility should take into account a system for 
          dropping off children and picking them up.


(+) Sister Gladys Guenther


- They support the proposed project.


- Allowing this permit would ensure a childcare 
          heritage that has been at the site for over 90 years.


(+) Sister Marianne Smith


- She began working for the center in the 40s.


- She hopes that the Commission will approve this 
          project.


(+) Pat Buscovich


- He is a member of the Board of Directors.


- This is the best quality childcare in the City.


- Their early education is essential.


- He is willing to get a white zone so that there 
          is a flow of traffic and not traffic problems.


(+) Les Wisebock - Architect


- When the parking is moved around the corner, this 
          will alleviate the traffic problems.


ACTION: Approved the project with the following 
          condition: Project Sponsor shall make best efforts to apply to the Department 
          of Parking and Traffic to obtain a white zone for pick up and drop off 
          periods with regular parking to be allowed for the remainder of the 
          day.

Certification of 
          a Final Environmental Impact Report
: The proposed project would 
          involve the demolition of a vacant, light-industrial building totaling 
          8,250 gross square feet (gsf) and construction of a five-story residential 
          building. The existing building proposed to be demolished is an historical 
          resource for purposes of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) 
          because it is rated as a Category III (Contributory) building under 
          Article 11 of the San Francisco Planning Code, an adopted local register. 
          The proposed building would be 33,340 gsf in building floor area and 
          would have 18 dwelling units. The proposed project would provide 18 
          off-street parking spaces for the residential units. The project site 
          at 1234 Howard Street (Assessor's Block 3728, Lot 014) is approximately 
          8,250 square feet in size and located about mid-block on the northern 
          side of Howard Street in the South of Market neighborhood in the block 
          bounded by Howard, Eighth, Natoma, and Ninth Streets. The project site 
          is zoned SLR (Service/Light Industrial/Residential) and within a 50-X 
          height/bulk district

- He supports this legislation.


(+) Steven Chester


- He supports this legislation because it is very 
          important.


- This legislation would allow units for people 
          who really need them.


- Until a private-public partnership is developed, 
          people should be allowed to live in SRO housing.


(+) Juan Blanco Prado


- He supports this legislation.


- Affordability requirements should be established.


- Housing is definitely needed and this is a very 
          important plan for the City to end homelessness.


(+/-) Anthony Faber


- He has been looking at this for a long time.


- He believes that there should be more of a mix 
          of income levels.


- He is not in favor of limiting SRO income units 
          to low and very low income.


- SOMA should not be restricted to affordable housing.


(-) Charles Breniger


- He is opposed to the legislation.


- There is no housing being created for people of 
          medium income.


- He has some units that have rent restriction.


- It is important to have a stepping-stone.


(-) Alice Barkley


- The question that should be asked by the Commission 
          to the Supervisors is why haven't more SROs been built?


- A range should be made to include affordable as 
          well as middle income.


- There are people that keep being ignored when 
          conversations go on about affordable housing.


- She urged the Commission to reject the legislation 
          in order to refine it and add a range.


(+/-) Jim Meko


- There is a profound distrust with anything associated 
          with the RBA.


- The very existence of this Commission is signs 
          that things have changed.


- There should be refinements done to this. Otherwise,

(Continued from Regular Meeting of January 20, 2005)


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Steve Currier - Outer Mission Residents Association 
          - Representing Discretionary Review Requestor


- The project will block a window of an adjacent 
          neighbor.


- This would greatly compromise the light and air 
          to that neighbor.


- They met with the owner to try to come to a compromise 
          but there was no agreement.


- They are willing and able to try to modify the 
          project by eliminating the third floor.


(-) Gwendolyn Giblin


- Her house will be affected by the construction.


- Staff has come to a reasonable recommendation. 
          The only issue here is the third floor.


(-) Mary Tam


- She is concerned with the impact the project will 
          have on her light and air.


- Her mother does her early morning prayers in an 
          area that is very sunny and this would impact her.


- She does not oppose the construction, just the 
          third level.


(+) Peter Pham - Representing Project Sponsor


- It is crucial for the project sponsor to add a 
          bathroom as it has been designed.


- Any modification would affect the neighbors yet 
          the neighbors concerns do not rise to any extraordinary impacts.


- The neighbor's house is blocked by existing trees, 
          which block the views and the light.


(+) Teresita de la Cruz


- She and her husband have spent most of their lives 
          working and living in San Francisco.


- Her house needs upgrades and modifications.


- As she and her husband get older, it would be 
          difficult for them to climb up the stairs that is why they need to install 
          a bathroom near their bedroom.


(+) Eleanor de la Cruz


- Her father is planning to retire.


- Having a bathroom in her parent's bedroom would 
          be a convenience to her elderly parents.


- They have made various attempts to compromise 
          with the neighbors.


(+) Mariann Sullivan


- She does not understand why there is a view concern 
          since there are many tall trees that block the view anyway.


- The building that is proposed is only 8 feet so 
          there is enough space between the houses.


- There have been concerns about the open space 
          but there have been neighbors that have constructed additions. She does 
          not believe that this is a valid argument.


- Many other neighbors are not opposed to the project.


(+) Barbara Driver


- She has lived on Winding Way since 1983.


- She is a member of the Association.


- She does not believe that the Association conducted 
          any voting on this project.


- Many of the neighbors are not opposed to the project.


- There are streets above her that can look down 
          on us and we can look down on other houses.


- Some of the homes in the neighborhood have telescopes.


ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and approved the 
          project with the following modifications: 1) remove top floor addition; 
          2) remove proposed bar sink on the second floor; 3) require the recordation

          property line.


- They have attempted to talk to the architect but

Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review 
          and Approve Project with Modifications










SPEAKER(S):


(-) Steven Helium - First Discretionary Review 
          Requestor


- Through conversation with the owner and the architect 
          an adjusted proposal was presented to remove the top level with no setback.


- Without the top level, it is still a massive structure.


- There are taller buildings at the end of the block 
          but are quite a distance away from the proposed project.


- The project will interfere with privacy, block 
          sunlight, etc from the adjacent neighbors.


(-) Scott Durcanin - Potrero Boosters Neighborhood 
          Association


- They are concerned about this project.


- They oppose the addition of two floors. Any alteration 
          plan should be noticed to the community.


(-) Paul Clayman


- He has lived next door to the proposed project 
          for 25 years.


- He read a letter from other adjacent neighbors 
          who oppose the project but could not come to the hearing.

- He has lived across the street from the proposed 
          project for 21 years.


- He has renovated his house twice.


- He has conducted a light study that doesn't discuss 
          a 4
th
 story addition but does discuss a 3
rd
 story 
          addition as well as a setback off the street.


- There is an impact to the homes across the street 
          as well, not just the adjacent homes.


(-) Laura Spiegleman


- She is the newest member of the neighborhood.


- She shares the concerns of her neighbors about 
          not being in support of the proposed project.


(+) Vinney Steinberg - Project Sponsor


- He is aware of the neighbor's concerns. 


- He does not believe that the project will impact 
          his neighbors.


- He had various conversations with the neighbors 
          and the Discretionary Review requestors.


- He has made many revisions to his design but there 
          are a lot of differences between the homes.


(+) Vera Kunda


- The addition will allow her family to live together.


- She does not know why her family is being put 
          in a special situation since many neighbors have constructed additions 
          to their properties.


ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and approved with 
          the following modifications: 1) add a 1 hour roof; 2) recess garage
