COMMISSIONERS’ QUESTIONS AND MATTERS


 


  
 
        
 4.
        
 Commission Comments/Questions


           
 Commissioner Hughes:




Requested a joint hearing with the Building Inspection Commission, regarding matters of mutual interest, related data management in the MIS system, on-going customer service and ways in which we might review and improve those aspects for both departments and how they interrelate to each other. Also a discussion, regarding the implementation of Better Neighborhoods Plus, and demolitions as it relates to permits that they see regarding alterations.




           


           
 
Zoning Administrator responded:




He is informed that the Building Inspection Commission would love to meet with the Planning Commission.


They are also asking for the same.
 
 There are certainly issues of mutual concern.





Commissioner Secretary responded to Commissioner Hughes request:




A joint hearing will depend on the availability of space, but will try to get it in before the end of this year.




Commissioner Bradford-Bell:




Requested that the commission reactivate the 10:00 p.m. policy.


Our meetings have been running tike marathon sessions for the last few meetings.


She personally will be instituting her own 10:00 p.m. policy.


Our Planning Commission Secretary, who is a phenomenal person and does an incredible amount of work…
 
 I had the opportunity to be here with her after our hearing.
 
 She has to clean the room after we all leave.
 
 She does it by herself.
 
 I am letting her know that I will make sure that I do my part to be as helpful as possible and hope that my fellow commissioners and members of public would help us also.




 


Commissioner W. Lee:




Requested all fellow Commissioners to work with the staff.


Mentioned an e-mail from Sara Vellve regarding her concerns about when the Commission changes the scheduled order of hearings and how that affects/cost staff time, costs the City money, and causes anxiety for the staff when they then can’t get here on time.




Commissioner Antonini:




Fee Study – requested that a copy be distributed to all Commissioners.




 


C.
        
 DIRECTOR’S REPORT


 




Director’s Announcements


In response to a couple of the commissioner’s concerns/delight about spending time with staff into the late hours--there are a couple of things we have been thinking about and will share those ideas with you in a memo.
 
 For instance, there are a variety of different ways of taking public comment on an item, for example.
 
 The Board of Permit Appeals stipulates that if you are member of the party that is on appeal you get a certain amount of time (like we give 5 minutes for the discretionary review applicant).
 
 Another idea, and I think we implemented it today, is to expand the use of the consent calendar.


Announced to the Commission that Dan Sider has been selected to be the Board of Supervisors’ liaison.

 Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals


BOS:




Two ordinances were reviewed: the Baby Diaper Changing Resolution introduced by Supervisor Sandoval – the ordinance was passed on first reading.


Supervisor McGoldrick’s changes to the Section 311 of the Planning Code.
 
 As the Zoning Administrator mentioned last week, the Board of Supervisors took two of the Planning Commission recommendations and also passed it on first reading.


Both items will appear before the Board for final action next week.


Three CEQA appeals were scheduled to be heard by the Board.
 
 None these were heard.
 


The Quonset hut appeal on 20
th
 Street – Appeal of the environmental document was withdrawn.


At the Land Use Committee:


150 Otis Street (Former Juvenile Hall) passed to the full board for consideration as a landmark.


Better Neighborhood Plus – Supervisor McGoldrick introduced a resolution to allow you more time to review it.
 
 The new review period expires October 7, 2005.


Supervisor Mirkarimi is interested in pursuing changes to the Planning Code in order to include the new Octavia Boulevard within the Hayes-Gough Neighborhood Commercial District.


Supervisor McGoldrick has introduced a resolution for adoption.
 
 This resolution would urge our department to require, as part of all building permit applications, a three-disclosure statement.




 


BOA:




The Green Cross on 22
nd
 and Guerrero is a Medical Cannabis Dispensary that was raising extensive neighborhood discussions. The permit was suspended.
 
 A hearing was held on July 15 where it was ultimately determined and issued a draft of a series of 28 conditions.
 
 Ultimately, they were submitted to the Board of Appeals with the recommendation to overturn his (the Zoning Administrator) recommendation of suspension and impose these conditions.
 
 The Dispensary decided to move to another district.




 




Department’s Work Program and Budget – Status Report






Zoning Administrator announced that Alicia John-Baptiste, Chief Financial Officer, was out of office last week, and requested this item be continued to October 6, 2005.

Expressed concerns about the legislation that Supervisor McGoldrick forwarded to the full Board of Supervisors regarding the 311 notifications.




Espanola Jackson

Planning Commission should have some sense of development in the City and work with other agencies so it something happens we have some standard operating procedures in place.


One component of the Better Neighborhoods Plus legislation is the element that is going to be introduced that places it in the Administrative Code.
 
 Why has it been taken from the Planning Department and put into the Administrative Code?




Judy Berkowitz

Request for Conditional Use authorization
 pursuant to 
Planning Code Sections 303, 725.38 and 790.84 to allow a conversion from residential to nonresidential use on the second floor of a building in the Union Street Neighborhood Commercial District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
 
 The proposal is to convert an approximately 1,280 square foot two-bedroom flat to office use (to be used in conjunction with Fredericksen’s Paint store located on the ground floor).


           
 Preliminary Recommendation: Disapproval


                       
 (Continued from Regular Meeting of August 11, 2005)


 


           
 SPEAKERS: 
   


           
 Malcolm Morrison, Architect, representing Project Sponsor




Gave a brief description of the project.


My client wishes to use their building to sustain and enhance their business.


The second floor conversion would be a compatible use mitigated by no changes to the exterior of the building and very little change to the interior.




Dennis Drobiazch, Project Sponsor




We need room to offer all the services that our customers desire.


The space above our paint shop would be ideal for expansion of our clerical department, as well as an excellent location to offer home improvements and home improvement classes for our customers.


We have never asked the Commission anything, except approval of the paint store.


With increased competition from other retailers, we feel we need more space to achieve our goal and to survive in this very competitive retail business.




Mary Drobiazch




Asked the Commission to approve their application.




Linda Galego.




We are the oldest hardware store in San Francisco. Our method of success has always relied on our ability to be flexible.
 


The community around us is changing, and so must we.




Francisco DeCosta




Spoke in support of the project.




Louis Beta




Supports the expansion for the conference room and learning center.

Appeal of a Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration.
 
On Lots 3 and 7 of Block 3994, the project would demolish two concrete warehouse/garage structures at 680 Illinois Street and 550 18th Street and construct one 50-foot tall building consisting of 35 dwelling units, 9,128 square feet of retail/commercial space, and about 35 off-street parking spaces.
 
 The project would include 74,012 square feet in five-stories, and four commercial spaces on the ground floor.
 
 The 50,966-sf residential uses would have open space provided through a second story deck.
 
 The 10,580 sf parking garage would be at the ground floor and accessed from Illinois Street. The two warehouse structures located at 680 Illinois Street (or 2075 Third Street) and 550 18th Street are included in the 
Central Waterfront Cultural Resource Survey,
 the M-2 zoning district, and 50-X height and bulk district.


Preliminary Recommendation: Uphold Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration


           
 
(Continued from the Regular Meeting of September 15, 2005)


 


                       
 SPEAKERS: 
   


           
 
Allan Landsberg, First Appellant




Requested to the Commission that a complete Environmental Impact Report be prepare for this project.


His concerns are based on five specific areas: land use, transportation, air quality, hazardous materials and visual quality.


Land use related concerns are based on the project’s contributions are continuing to whittle away the viable land for PDR activities.




Patrick Mooney, Second Appellant




We are not opposed to development in the area.


We do believe that this is a unique opportunity because this neighborhood is going through a rebirth.


There has not been consideration given to parking.




           
 
James Halloran, Local 22




Concerned about the hazardous materials and the lack of documentation of those materials.


Some 50 years ago, there were several stored tanks removed from the site.
 
 There is no documentation of the process in which they were removed or of any potential hazard that was in place at that time.


A building in this area may have many different concerns--possible asbestos exposure.


There is quite possibly lead paint exposure within the building and its exterior.




David Cortez, Local 22




Concerned about parking.


This project is going to be a negative impact to our members.


Urged the Commission to conduct an investigation of how the lack of parking is going to affect the traffic and air quality in the area.




Gary Cooley




Asked the Commission to reject the conditional use application for this project, because it does not meet the high standards established by the City for granting the permit.


This project as proposed does not have enough parking for all of its commercial spaces.


It will rely in part on street parking and result in [people] driving around until a space becomes available.


Parking is even worse when the Giants are playing at home.




 
 Judith Gatewood




Asked the Commission to reject the conditional use for this project, because it does not address the project’s impact on both the members and the workers of Local 22
.




Shawn Leonard


-
 
 Opposes the project.


Jason DeCook




It is inappropriate to continue building residential structures in an area that needs production, distribution and repair uses.




Pat Mulligan




Urged the Commission to reject the negative declaration for 680 Illinois Street.




 


Hector Cardenas




Opposes the project.


Concerned about the traffic issue.




Sylvia Reynolds




Asked the Commission to reject the negative declaration.




No name stated




Concerned about traffic.




Aaron Gruss




The findings of this mitigated negative declaration regarding the historic buildings on the site, are not consistent or adequate.


About four years ago the Planning Department conducted a historic resource survey in the Waterfront area.
 
 That survey resulted in the creation of a potential historic district to which these buildings are contributors.


A survey advisory committee made up of 13 qualified professionals from across the City reviewed the survey results. They included the Planning Department, S.F. Architectural Heritage, Landmarks Board, Architectural Resources, Port of San Francisco, S.F. Beautiful, Page & Turnbull and The California Office of Historic Preservation.


When they reviewed the findings they requested the following conditions: “establish justifiable boundaries of the district, define the characteristics of contributory buildings to the district and create a list of structures that would be contributors and non-contributors to the district”


This works has not been completed.
 


The Planning Department needs to provide more information about this potential district before we can determine the impact this project will have.




Joe Bass




Read a letter from the Dogpatch Association, requesting that the Commission require that an Environmental Impact Report be prepared.




Francisco DeCosta




Concerned about quality of life issues that have not been addressed in this negative declaration.




Tomas McCarthy




Opposed to project because of the lack of clarifications on environmental issues involve with this project.


This project should be subject to a very careful environmental review.




Luke Vratny




This project is a logistic nightmare to all our union members.




Catherine Chase




Concerned about parking and hazardous materials.




John Sanger, representing Project Sponsor




This preliminary negative declaration has covered all issues.
 
 This was not a rush job. It has been one long year.


The environmental study was conducted by an independent organization, ICS, and determined that there was no obvious contamination present.


Of course asbestos is sometimes found in buildings that are more than 50 years old, and these buildings are proximately 50-55 years old.

 SPEAKERS: 
   


           
 
John Sanger, Representing Project Sponsor.




Gave a general description of the project.




Eva Hom




Supports this project because it is located in an area that is well served by transit.




Reed Shelby




Concerned about he parking issues.




Marge Vincent




Read some letters from some of the residents in the area supporting this project.




Marty Wolf




This project is very welcome in our neighborhood.




Johanne Gormley




Is in support of the project.




Manuel Alvarado




Supports the project because the City needs beauty and that is what we are going to have at 680 Illinois St.




Dierdre Cassidy




In support of the project.




Randy Thume




This project has the full support of most of the neighbors in the area.




Pat Mulligan




This project does not fit in the Central Waterfront Plan.




           
 
No name stated




Asked the Commission to reject the conditional use application.




 
 Jim Halloran




There is a huge concern about public safety.


If a project is going to be built there, the project must be abated properly prior to the beginning of construction.




Joe Boss




We all recognize that we need to produce housing.
 
 And yet, here is a project that will stick up to 50 feet in an area that when the Planning Department finishes it could be 60 or 65 feet.


It is unfortunate to allow this conditional use to move forward when you quite possibly are leaving 15 or 20 residential units aside.
 
 This will be rather tragic.




Jim Salinas Sr.




Our members will be greatly impacted.


This type of project is devastating to the neighborhood.




James Nunemacher




Our goal is to contribute good quality, high quality housing to San Francisco.


Asked the Commission to approve the conditional use application.




Judith Gatewood




It is extremely disingenuous to say that the developer has repeatedly met with Local 22 staff and the Executive Board of the Dogpatch association.


It is the duty of the Planning Commission to make this City livable for everyone.

Establishing a Visitacion Valley Community Facilities and Infrastructure Fee and Fund.

Consideration of an Ordinance adding Planning Code Sections 319 through 319.7 to impose a $4.58 per square foot fee on new residential development in the Visitacion Valley area
, to establish a Visitacion Valley Community Facilities and Infrastructure Fund to mitigate impacts from residential development on public infrastructure in Visitacion Valley including libraries, streets, playgrounds, recreational facilities, and community centers, and making findings including findings under the California Environmental Quality Act


           
 
INFORMATIONAL ONLY


           


SPEAKERS:


Espanola Jackson




Executive Park has always been residential.
 
 It has never been a mixed-use area.




Francisco DeCosta




It is wrong for some ordinance to propose to the Planning Department and the constituents to build a street, swimming pool, park, library, or open space without due process.


The meeting that was held at Visitacion Valley--60% of the people did not know anything about what was going to be done.


It has to be an open process.




John King




Read the Executive Park Executive Committee resolution on behalf of his father, who was unable to make this meeting.
 
 In the letter they urged the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors to not approve the proposed fee ordinance.




George Yurvee




Opposes the ordinance.




Erick Harrison




He is concerned about the timing of the payment, the amount of the fee, and [lack of] certainty.


Unlike other areas in City, we have a substantial amount of infrastructure and site preparation work we need to do before we start building on the residential building infrastructures.




Michael Burk




We all win with the project is built.
 
 The developers get the projects up.
 
 We get more housing, and there are fees that come through and support community facilities.
 
 But if the developer cannot finance his project, we all loose.
 
 Timing is the key issue here.




Barry Freeland




Fees like these make projects less viable.
 
 They make us look harder to try to figure out where to get the money.
 
 It has the potential of killing jobs.

Request for Discretionary Review
 of Demolition Permit Application No. 2004.11.19.9724 to demolish a one-story Quonset hut used as a artist’s live-work studio, and replace it with a mixed-use building with six dwelling units over garage and commercial space in an NC-2 (Small-Scale Neighborhood Commercial) Use

 SPEAKERS:


           
 Nick Paguaro, Mission Ant-Displacement Coalition




The proposed project at this site is to build more market rate housing, which is not what we need in our neighborhood.


The Mission District is historically an artist community. It values the vibrancy of its culture.


One of the reasons why the character of the Mission is changing is because this sort of project is allowed to come in and take away these resources.




Unclear name




There have been more PDR displacements and there are no zoning controls.


The lots of Quonset Hut is really significant and offers flexible use for artist.


It is also significant in terms of displacement pressures on PDR businesses




Malia Chavez




Encouraged the Planning Commission to please not to displace the Quonset Hut.


Quonset Hut is really representative of flexible use places.




Jose Carrasco




This is authentic art space for people to create.
 
 Art is shrinking in the Mission year by year.


Quonset Hut is perfectly suited for this kind of thing.


Keeping the Quonset Hut will preserve the culture and ethnic character and continuity of the Mission District.




Lou Blazej, representing Project Sponsor




Project Sponsor would be willing to entertain a serious offer to sell the building if the neighborhood group had the money.


Unfortunately, the Discretionary Review Requestor is using this appeal process to try to frustrate this development so they can kind of force a sale.


This building right now is not for sale.


Asked the Commission to not use their discretionary power in this type transaction, which is very unfair.


Also gave a brief description of the project.




           
 Joe Perella




Is in favor of the project.




Allan Callahan, one of the building owners




Asked the Commission to approve their project.
