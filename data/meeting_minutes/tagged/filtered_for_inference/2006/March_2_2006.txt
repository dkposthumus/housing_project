BAYVIEW HUNTERS POINT REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND ZONING EIR
 - 
Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report
 prepared for the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency's (SFRA) proposed Bayview Hunters Point (BVHP) Redevelopment Plan, and possible future amendments to the India Basin Industrial Park (IBIP) and Bayview Industrial Triangle (BIT) Redevelopment Plans, and related rezoning.
 
 The Project Area is located in the southeastern quadrant of the City and County of San Francisco in the area generally bounded by Cesar Chavez Street to the north, US 101 to the west, San Mateo County to the south, and the San Francisco Bay to the east.
 
 The proposed redevelopment program would 
institute tax increment financing for the area added to the Hunters Point Redevelopment Project and for the Bayview Industrial Triangle Redevelopment Project, and would rezone land in the Bayview Hunters Point area.
 
 The total allocation of net new floor area within the Bayview Hunters Point Redevelopment Area would be approximately 2.2 million square feet by 2020.
 
 The potential mall at Candlestick Park would comprise approximately half of this new floor area.
 
 Approximately 6,200 net new employees would work in the Bayview Hunters Point Redevelopment Area.
 
 In addition, the Redevelopment Area would see an increase of approximately 3,600 new dwelling units by 2020.
 
 The northern section of the Project Area is zoned Heavy Industrial (M-1) and Light Industrial (M-2).
 
 The Third Street commercial corridor is zoned primarily Neighborhood Commercial (NC-3), with pockets of Heavy and Light Industrial zoning on the northern and southern edges of the corridor.
 
 Residentially zoned land is located east and west of Third Street.
 
 Residential, Industrial and Neighborhood Commercial zoning classifications are in the Hunters Point Shoreline area.
 
 Other pockets of Neighborhood Shopping zoning are along Gilman Avenue and along Hunters Point Boulevard and Innes Avenue.
 
 The southern portions of the Project Area generally are zoned Residential and Heavy Commercial, and Public within the Candlestick Point area.


 
 Preliminary Recommendation: 
Certify the Final Environmental Impact Report.

SPEAKERS:


John McCarthy




I live in the East Bay.


I first got involved with base closure, including Hunters Point, over 12 years ago.


I have been preoccupied with Army business a lot ever since.


Relative to the environmental impact questions, I kind of got the impression that the radiological survey information was not considered terribly relevant.


I have huge reservations about that.


I will be looking at all the environmental documentation on potential shipyard impacts in the PAC area.
 
 Area B in particular.
 
 More specifically, the rectangle on one end of the Medium Density Housing Zoned Area that is surrounded by shipyard parcel A.


There are sites inside that area as well as around it, all of which are noted as radiologically impacted.


So if need be, I will be requesting through Sunshine Ordinance or whatever it takes as a potential public health issue.
