 SPEAKERS:
 


Joel Yodowitz, on behalf of Project Sponsor




We want to take over two storefronts on Union Street.


Keep the exterior with a new coat of paint and original signage.


This proposal will be good for San Francisco residents and the health and convenience of the City by allowing people a full service health club and gym.


If would be good for local businesses because it will generate pedestrian traffic on Union Street and promote patronage of near by businesses.


No parking is required by the code.


We expect most people to walk or take public transit to the gym.


The person requesting that this be taken off the consent calendar is a competitor of a very small palates studio.


We don't compete with yoga or palates studios.


Crunch has weights.
 
 It doesn't offer personalized studio type classes like the person who wants this taken off the consent calendar.


The concern that Crunch would affect their business is over stated and it shouldn't be a fear.




Daron Press




I would be the co-owner of the studio that Joel is referring to.


My wife and I own Mercury Fitness focusing on palates.


It has come to our attention that Crunch is opening a block and a half away from us.
 
 There is a focus on small group classes there.


There is a Crunch three blocks up the street on Polk and Union.
 
 1500 feet away.


For me, I find it hard to believe that crunch would want to open up another so close to another gym.


The Union Street [association] prides itself on supporting businesses and tries to stop saturation of formula businesses retail or personal services.


This is not an added benefit to the community.


There are many fitness facilities in that district that offer the same classes they offer.


Parking will be an issue.


Our bottom line as well as other small fitness centers will be adversely affected by this place opening up two blocks away.


I am asking to protect the small fitness centers by taking their application for conditional use and removing it from the calendar, which we are doing now, and oppose it.

 SPEAKERS:
 


 
 
Discretionary Review Requestor




Our main concern is the blockage of sunlight to our kitchen, which is on the south side and there is a bay window that sticks out.


We will have minimal light in the kitchen if the proposed project is approved.


The sponsor has placed a balcony in that area.


It's a clear view to our kitchen and [will cause a] severe lack of privacy and it did not meet our concern to the sunlight in the kitchen.


I recommended alternative suggestions.


Because the residents concern is not a garage, they can build in that area.
 
 They don't have to build a second floor.


We want an adequate setback that doesn't block the light from our kitchen.


Most kitchens are designed for the most sunlight to enter.
 
 We will have minimal if the proposed project is approved.




George Sang, Representing the Project Sponsor
 




I have known the family for more than 20 years.


They have been living there for 15 years.


All these years they have wanted to have a house like everyone else on the block.


The house now is less than a thousand square feet.
 
 They want another 600 square feet.


We feel that we are not asking anything that's not in the neighborhood.




Yu Chi Chin




When they bought the house, they had not much money.


Now that the children are grow-up, she would like to make her house a safe environment to get out of her car to go to the new addition.




 


 
 ACTION:

Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project as proposed.


 


 
 SPEAKERS:
 


 
 Perry Chia – representing Dennis McCarthy, DR requestor




I live in back to the south of the subject property.


The subject property is adjacent to this property, which has been sold.


The former owner signed a letter of support; these owners have not signed a letter of support.


We object to the proposed three-story building because it's not compatible with the other two-story buildings.


This project will affect the adjacent houses.
 
 It is going farther and higher.
 
 It is going 13 feet deeper; and 17 feet deeper to the buildings to the north.


We proposed
 
 a two-story building in accordance with their proposal.


We proposed a 2-story building.
 
 Downstairs, which has a room that they call an exercise room but looks like an illegal in-law or second unit has a second entrance and a direct connection to the garage that can be converted to an illegal unit by moving this door and moving that door there.
 
 We propose that can be a bedroom and the staircase can descend straight down.


We propose the bedroom they renamed a study remain a bedroom; and we propose dining room remain as the dining room and the rear bedroom become a bedroom and bathroom.


They will achieve their goal of three bedrooms, four bathrooms with a two-story building.


It can be achieved much cheaper than a three-story building and we feel this is a win/win proposal.




Karen Mitchell




I live on 26
th
 Avenue behind the subject property and a little to the north.


My topic is the height of the project.


The height of the three-story building is not compatible with the neighboring of two-stories in the RH-1 District.


The plan to put on a front deck is incompatible with any of the houses




Deli Young, Project Sponsor




Dennis McCarthy filed DR and he is not here.


Karen, I don't believe, lives within the 150-foot radius.


In October 2004 and September 2005, we had our first and second out reach meeting to discuss concern about blocked views.


On December 22, 2005 we had a third out reach meeting at the request of certain neighbors that claimed their concerns were not being addressed.


To address Sheila and Lucy on how the property will fit in the character of the other houses -- these flats are made out of a mix of two and three story houses.


The purpose of the front setback incorporate my plans to minimize the impact on the character of the existing block.


For Sheila McCarthy concern how the property will affect her privacy and amount of light -- the current subject property plan sufficiently addresses her concerns pertaining to her house.


To address Rose and Margaret, they didn't have concerns on how the property will block the ocean view.
 
 It was indicated that we were in our right to expand our property.


Karen is outside the 150-foot boundary criteria.


The Meeting was adjourned when no one had additional questions or concerns.


Today, we are here at the hearing of Discretionary Review because a neighbor is complaining that his concerns regarding my project have not been addressed.


The trend you may see is that every time we have a meeting to discuss the concern of the project they come back with more issues to delay the project.


I do not think there is anything we can do to satisfy the neighbor.
 
 In other words, they don't want us to build in any manner.


I do have a letter of support from the neighbor's house that was sold.




Larry




I am a 35 years resident on 27
th
 Avenue.


Much the neighbors to my north have three-story buildings.


[Showing a picture] This project is almost on the sidewalk and blocks a significant amount of my light and air.


I want to note that the Wong's project does not and I see no reason why it shouldn't go forward.


All the paperwork I have seen – it looks like a lawful project.


I don't see how one person can stop another person from their project as long as they follow the guidelines.


These neighbors are good neighbors.
 
 They have bent over backwards to conform to the laws of San Francisco and keep to the shape and look of our neighborhood.


I am asking you to approve their project.




Paul Nazaler




I live across the street from the proposed project.


I have no problems with this project.


It conforms to the Planning Commission and zoning.


I hope you will pass an opportunity not to discretionary review it and will approve it.




Don Wong, Project designer




My brother and sister-in-law asked me to do this project three years ago.


Had I known this would happen, I would not drawn the plans up.


I did not know it would take three years.


We are not talking about building a mansion.


They have two kids.


I worked with Michael Smith at Planning.
 
 We complied with everything he asked us to do.
