Preliminary
Recommendation: Approval with conditions


(Continued from Regular Meeting of June 22, 2000)


 


SPEAKER(S):


(+) Tim Tosta - Baker and McKenzie - Attorney for Project
Sponsor


- There are two owners: the undeveloped parcel is one
ownership and 160 Harrison building is another related ownership.


- The 160 Harrison Street building will store computer
servers for Internet content.


- There will be billions of dollars of commerce going
through the computer servers installed in this building.


- This building will provide security and reliable power to
address loss of power, brownouts and power surges.


- The building will also be enhanced for protection from
natural disasters.


(+) Michael Duncan - Skidmore, Owens and Merril


- Equipment needs to be put on the roof for height and
airflow concerns.
? 
Air must go through
where the equipment will be located.
?

The equipment must be ventilated vertically and the air then allowed to
flow out.


- If this equipment was placed in the basement there would
be a need to merge the first floor with the basement.
? 
There would also be a need to install ducts for air to ventilate
vertically and another for air to come out.


- The cost to rehab this building would be comparable to the
cost of two 25-story high-rises.


(+) Arnold Townsend


- He has been working with the prospective tenant and the
contractor.
? 
They have been very
proactive and aggressive in terms of their first source hiring
commitments.
? 
They will be working with
training programs through community-based organizations and the City (e.g.
people who are moving from welfare to work).


- One of the opportunities that is about to be missed with
all of these dot.com companies is that they are complaining that there are no
people to hire.
? 
He believes these
companies should hire people of color or disadvantaged and give them
opportunities to work.
? 
The 160 Harrison
project program will do just that.


(+) Debra Stein


- They had an opportunity to speak to about 18 different
organizations and mailed out about 1,000 mailers.
? 
Most everyone was very pleased with this project and are willing
to work with them.
? 
A few concerns
consisted of: lighting, security cameras, paint to reflect character of the
neighborhood, etc.


- They have not come across any opposition to this project.


(-) Sue Hestor


- She is not in agreement with the way staff has handled
this project.
? 
This site needs to be re
zoned for housing when it falls from public use.










- Is this a business service use?
? 
If it is, then it has to pay transportation impact development
fees.


- If the site next door can hold a 600,000 sf building and
500,000 of it will be housing and this is a building of 125,000 sf then the
ratio is 6 to 1 housing to commercial, there should be another 50,000 sf on the
adjacent site.


- Require the developer to initiate rezoning and pay for all
the fees and put some restrictions now on the use next door.


(-) Anastasia Yovanopoulos


- This use is more like an e-commerce thing.
? 
It is also a bit of science fiction.


- Not very much business will go to the average citizen,
therefore driving up the cost of housing.
?

This will make the project next door not affordable and not compatible
to the affordable housing needed in this city.

SPEAKER(S):










(+)
Jonathan Pearlman - Architectural Design Studio - Project Sponsor


- The
existing building was built in the >70s and it was actually a two story
building that did come out to the street facade.
? 
It has been extensively remodeled to the condition it is now.


- The old
bank safe is a major concrete structure.


- The
entire building has different construction from different years.


- The
facade cannot be designed as an older building like the surrounding structures
since it?s a modern building.


(+)
Bill Riffle


- The
actual floor area is set back 5 feet from the property line.


- The
building was built as Gibraltar Savings and Loan, purchased by Security Pacific
Bank.
? 
When Bank of America merged with
Security Pacific Bank it was sold as excess property.


- He purchased
the property and converted it.


-
Although he is a small business owner, he feels that he can compete offering
the same services as the Abig guys.@


(-)
Cliff Lundberg - Lives at 4028 24th Street


- He
lives in the flat on the second floor right next door.


- The
policy against second story commercial use has been a very successful one.
? 
This would be a violation of this
policy.
? 
This project will also impact
parking.


- The
light well in his home will be impacted by the proposed construction.


- The
back yard use, is a bit bothersome to him because it would be a place for
people to ` hang out and smoke so it would be different from regular
residential back yards.


- He did
not receive any notification of the construction.


(-)
Anastasia Yovanopoulos - Member of Noe Valley Tenants


- The
proposed project will take away houses and parking, which will cause traffic
congestion.


- She
believes that it would be a waste of good space to put commercial use
here.
? 
It should be residential.


(-)
Paul Candis - President of the Castro East and West Improvement Club.


- This
club has been in existence since 1904.
?

They have always worked for the quality of the neighborhood.
? 
They are concerned that the area is zoned
for residential only above the street floor.
?

Although this project is not taking away residential space, maybe some
type of a condition could be place on the property--if Zephyr ever sold the
space, this would come to the Commission for review of any proposed use of the
upstairs space.


- His
organization has reservations about this project.

(+) Dan Liberthsen - Secretary of the Miraloma Park Improvement

- The difficulty with Woodside Drive, particularly with the

The design
is such that the residents won?t block the sidewalk and street while they are

SPEAKER(S):


(+) Steve Williams -Represents Ted Loewenberg and Leah
Harper


- He supports a conditional use in a residential
neighborhood.


- This project has full support of the neighborhood.


- This is a wonderful example of what a conditional use
should be.
? 
It can fit into the
neighborhood, it can be compatible with a neighborhood and it can serve the
neighborhood.


- He believes that this proposal complies with code section
303:
? 
It is compatible in it?s size,
it?s desirable, and necessary for that neighborhood.
? 
The entire neighborhood supports this project.


- The owners are willing to minimize the impact on housing
by leaving 1 unit in this 3 unit building on the housing market.


- This can be a win-win situation.


- There is no impact on MUNI or parking.


(+) Ted Loewenberg - Project Sponsor


- The hospitality industry is vital to the city of San
Francisco.
? 
There were over 17 million
visitors in our City.


- Spencer House, a bed and breakfast, closed.
? 
It returned 6 bed and breakfast room to the
residential market -- creating a shortage in the bed and breakfast space.


- The Sprekles Mansion also closed several years ago.
? 
Therefore, there is a need for a service
like this.










- More than 70% of our guests coming to this B&B come
there to visit friends and family in the neighborhood.
? 
What they love about being there is the
convenience of being around the corner or on the next block.

- She has lived in this neighborhood since 1978.


- She lives in a studio, if the building ever shut down, she
would not be able to afford anywhere else.


- Because she lives in a studio, she has no space for
friends and family to stay with her so having the Harper House close by is
wonderful.


(+) David Keller - Lives at 1315

neighborhoods.
?

cleaners.
? 
These businesses were replaced
with businesses that do not serve the neighborhood.


- This is a great addition for people in the neighborhood.

- Leah and Ted have been very active in the community.
? 
Leah organizes people to wrap Christmas
gifts.

House.

96 HOMESTEAD STREET
, northwest corner of Homestead and
25th Streets; Lot 014A in Assessor?s Block 6503 -- Request for Discretionary
Review of BPA No. 2000/01/14/108, proposing to demolish an existing first floor
porch and construct a three-story addition at the rear of the existing
two-story over garage, single-family dwelling in an RH-2 (Residential, House,
Two-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary
Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve building permit
application as revised.


 


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Anthony Jiles -
DR Requestor


- Everyone who opposes
this project has a completely reasonable and uniform view on what they are
asking the Commission and that is not to allow this project to go up and above
the roof line of the existing matching 6 Edwardian Houses.


- When people really
understood the design, they were shocked.


- The shadow studies, if
they are correct, would cause a deck to be completely shadowed.


- Noe Valley
neighborhood had singled out single family houses that go up 3 stories above
garage.


- The units which are
comparable are not single housing projects., they are condominiums.


(-) Ken Mancuso -
Lives at 4519 25th Street


- The building is designed
significantly larger than some of the surrounding buildings and homes.
? 
It is out of context and too large for the
block.


(-) Laurence Grunberg


- Lives two houses to
the north of the proposed construction.


- His concern, as it has
been stated by others, is the roofline (the third story height).


- He respects his
neighbors rights to expand their house as they need for more space.
? 
But a corner house really defines the
neighborhood and helps define the street going in both directions.
? 
The roofline will be extremely visible since
it?s 3 stories over garage.
? 
It?s a
precedent that the neighborhood doesn?t want to support.


(-) Ernie Beffel - 70
Homestead Street










- Lives 5 houses to the
north.


- He has been actively
involved in reviewing the last 4 projects on Homestead Street.


- There have been 4
projects located on Homestead Street that came before the Commission.
? 
Three of the projects were 2 stories over
garage.
? 
The 4th project which was
proposed for 3 stories over garage was revised eventually to 2 stories over
garage.


- Given this history, he
opposes 3 stories over garage.
? 
He
recommends that it be sunk somewhat into the ground so it?s 2 1/2 stories over
garage.
? 
Or, that the addition go out
further so the same number of square feet can be accomplished.


- He and the neighbors
are concerned that if this project goes forward someone will want to purchase
three downhill houses that remain underdeveloped and make them three stories.


- Another suggestion
would be to continue the project for mediation purposes.


(-) Al Longfield -
Lives at 4515 AB@ 25th Street


- Most of the people
speaking to support the DR don?t have a problem with the addition.


- The addition causes
problems with the aesthetics of the neighborhood.


- Adding an addition of
70 to 75% of the existing square footage is a very dangerous precedent to
set.
? 
This matter should be
reconsidered.


(-) Carey Perloff -
Lives at 92 Homestead Street


- Most of the houses
which approach the scale of the proposed house are multi unit houses.


- This house is widely
out-of-scale.


- On April 6, she and
her husband looked at the shadow studies and looked at the shadow impact on
their home.
? 
They decided it was totally
unacceptable to them.
? 
Three months later,
nothing has changed with the plans or design.


(-) Ken McNeely -
Lives at 4521 25th Street


- He endorses the
comments by his neighbors.


- His concern is that
the height does affect the light and air on his property.


(+) Audrey Co -
Project Sponsor


- Their growing family is
the cause for the Increased space needs.
?

They looked into many design alternatives trying to put them into the
smallest envelope possible.
? 
Building
something in the garage would be impossible because it?s uninhabitable.


?
???????????????????????? 
-
Discussions and meetings with the neighbors took place and she is surprised
that there are so many neighbors here since they had not heard from many of the
neighbors even though they had meetings with them.


- Shadow studies show
little added impact from the 2-story vs. the 3-story rear addition.


- Scale and design fits
in with neighborhood.
? 
DR Requestor?s
house is within 15 % of proposed project size.
?

- There are more than 20 additional properties in immediate vicinity
that are comparable or larger.


(+) Tony Pantaleoni -
Project Architect


- He was concerned about
blocking the neighbors views.


- He did a study on
possibly constructing the addition in the basement but the car spaces would be
lost.
? 
He looked into the living room
but it became evident that it would not work.
?

So he tried to minimize the mass of the addition proposed for the
rear.
? 
He tried to keep it as small and
compact as he possibly could to minimize the view blockage.


- He is not trying to
set precedent here.
? 
This is not a
monster home.


(+) Gayta Bell - 


- Their family has
grown.


- They have Abent over
backwards@ to try to fit what they need into the smallest possible space.
? 
They are not developers, but family.


- They have been good
neighbors with the folks at 92 Homestead.
?

They are not asking for anything exceptional or unique.










- They have lived there
for 9 years.


- Street parking is very
difficult and they don?t want to be forced to park on the street.


- They would like to
stay in their home, where they have lived for 9 years; and would like to stay
in their neighborhood, where they have lived for 20 years.

SPEAKER(S):


 


John de Castro - Lives in Potrero Hill


- He has been a resident of Potrero Hill for over 20 years.


- There is a similar problem in the Mission as well as
Potrero Hill --rampant, unplanned office development and business services
being perpetuated throughout the neighborhoods.


- He finds it hard to believe that the ZA authorized the Ron
Kaufman project at 450 Rhode Island as business services.
? 
His marketing people sit right next to this
site and it is definitely not a business service.
? 
It?s an office.


- This is just an attempt to get around prop M.


- Most of the hill is surrounded by land that has either
been zoned commercial or industrial.


- They need money allocated in next year?s budget to expand
the neighborhood planning efforts.
?

Similar to what is going on with the Neighborhood 2000, in the Dogpatch
area.


- The planning Commission is addressing that area.
? 
A similar effort needs to be made to the
Mission District.


Patricia Vaughey


- She has problems with information being provided on
computers.


- On item 19, 5 out of 6 associations did not get notified.


Gladys Sandlin - Executive Director of Mission Neighborhood
Health Center


- This health center has been in the neighborhood for 23 1/2
years.
? 
They serve 13,000 patients.


- 40% of the 13,000 patients have been forced to leave the
City.
? 
These are the people that work in
the hotel industry, they serve our food, they do attendant care, they clean our
houses, etc.


- There is an increase in community needs.


- She would like to urge the Commission to form a
community-based coalition and plan appropriately.


- She requests that the Commission takes this seriously
because they are the people that move the City.
? 
The Commissioners are elected officials who have the civic duty
to uphold the social contract to ensure the unique character of San Francisco.


Leroy Moore


- Advocate of minority organization.


- The only family organization for children in the Mission
is located in the Bay View Building which will be closing.


- How can they serve the community if they can?t live in the
community?


Lisa Gray-Garcia
? 
-
Poor Magazine


- The Commission holds the future of non-profits, low-income
and working people.
? 
The Commission has
been systematically approving projects that push them out of the City.


- Poor Magazine exists to get voices heard that are not
heard


- She is proposing as a community, that if the Commission
doesn?t do something soon to help the nonprofits, they will be forced to have
Aoutbursts.@


Ethel Newlin - St. John?s Educational Threshold Center


- The children and youth are the future.
? 
The way things are going now there will be
no future in San Francisco because people with families will not be able to
live here.


- How does building an office complex affect the
children?
? 
The people who work in the
new office complex will need a place to live.


- It doesn?t matter anymore if you are poor, working class,
or middle class.
? 
People with money are
coming into the City and either purchasing or renting, therefore, pushing the
poor out.


- A city with no young people has no future.










- The commission has the responsibility as custodians of the
future to plan for a place for people to live, work and raise their families.


Sergio Canjura


- Current project coordinator of a proposed Mission
Neighborhood Resource Center in the Mission District which will serve the poor
and homeless in the area.


- Due to the decisions that the Commission has made, their
organization hasn?t been able to find a site to run this project.


- He would like for the Commission to respect them, to take
account of what the people really need.


- There are people in the area that need the resources and
space in the area.


Antonio Alcala


- He requested a moment of silence for all the people that
might die on the streets because they have been evicted and have no place to go
since there is no affordable housing in the City.


Carmen Ramirez


- She supports the Latino and Color community in the Mission
District.


- She has been suffering for over 3 years and is afraid of
displacement of her small business.


- It is very difficult to maintain a small business in the
Mission District.


- She asked the Planning Department and the Planning
Commission to put their feelings forward along with the decisions they make.


- There are children and families that are being affected
with these decisions.


- There are no words to describe what families go through when
they are displaced.


- She thanked the for the time the Commission takes to help
the community.


- Please take these words and thoughts into consideration.


Eric Quesada
 - Member of the Mission Anti-displacement Coalition


- There is a rally outside of City Hall representing those
people who have been displaced.


- The Mission District community and other working class
neighborhoods have not been the same since the evening of June 28.
? 
Before that many have spent countess hours
giving testimony in front of the Commission.
?

They have spent countless hours fighting eviction after eviction for the
past 5 years.
? 
The result is that they
feel more and more removed, discounted and dis-empowered.


- The community will act now and speak no matter who it
offends.


- Today they are here as delegates of the Mission
Anti-Displacement Coalition and representing sectors of their community and the
voices outside of City Hall protesting the policies of displacement the
Commission has implemented.
? 


- He publicly acknowledged the attendance of Director Green,
Commissioner Chinchilla, Commissioner Mills, and Commissioner Richardson at
their June 28 community meeting.


- They would like to give a brief presentation of what was
presented at that meeting.


Matt Brown - St. Peter?s Housing Coalition


- There are over 500 people outside on the Polk Street side
in front of City Hall.


- The Mission District has
?

always been the home of poor and working class families.
? 
These families are being driven out of their
homes from this City because of the developments the Commission has been
approving.


- This Coalition counsels and advises low income renters
from all over the City about their rights and responsibilities.
? 
In the 4 years he has worked there, the
numbers have tripled. 


- Government officials can do something to protect low
income families by adopting the Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition?s temporary
moratorium on new development.










- Since 1994 developers have built 650 new live/work units
in the Mission District alone.
? 
These
units are not meant for families.
? 
These
lofts are displacing businesses and are changing the face of the Mission
District.
? 
About less than 5% of the new
650 units are occupied by artists.
? 
The
vast majority of artists are not able to afford a $500,000 one bedroom
apartment.


- Sheik condos are taking over the middle class, immigrant
and facility-centered neighborhood.


Antonio Dias - Member of PODER and the Mission
Anti-Displacement Coalition


- The demand that was made at the community meeting on June
28, 2000 was about an immediate moratorium covering the entire Mission District
on conversions and new construction of office space, dot.com space, or business
service space or whatever it is being called this week.


- Because of the actions of the Planning Department and the
Planning Commission, there is a proliferation of office space in the
neighborhood.
? 
The price of real estate
has Asky rocketed@ which makes it difficult to develop affordable housing and
maintain small businesses and light industry.
?

The proliferation of these dot.com spaces is the reason for the high
rents in the Mission.


- Just a few weeks ago, Bryant Square was approved for
160,000 sf of office space.
? 
2701 16th
Street is being converted to 100,000 sf of office from apparel
manufacturing.
?? 
At 2300 Harrison
Street, a factory is being converted to 68,000 sf of offices.
? 
The Best Foods Building is being converted
to office space with no hearing at all.


- There has been about 850,000 sf of office space converted
in the past 4 years.


- Smaller industrial buildings throughout the Mission
District have been converted to office use without any notices or hearings.


- Rent levels in the neighborhood have been adjusted to
downtown office rent levels.


- He acknowledges that a day after the community meeting
held on June 28, the Planning Department sent a letter of violation to Mr.
Robert Court, who?s family purchased the Bay View Building.
? 
Yet, it shouldn?t be up to the community to
be notifying the department of doing it?s job.


Gena Castro - Mission Neighborhood Center


- She is here as a delegate of the Mission Anti-Displacement
Coalition.


- Since 1994 the Planning Commission has promised to rezone
the Mission District, protect jobs, and limit live/work lofts.
? 
Instead the Commission has not rezoned the
district, has had no comprehensive community input into land use planning,
approved hundreds of live/work lofts and allowed industrial buildings to be
used as offices. 


- Community members have developed an assessment of the
Mission.
? 
Community organizers
? 
are soon to open community process to
include maximum and meaningful participation.
?

The community is working on creating a zoning initiative to protect the
neighborhood.


- The community is here to inform the Commission that they
have two demands: 1) the Commission commit to a community-based process to
rezone the Mission and work with them to create a meaningful community
inclusiveness;
? 
2) The Commission
reprogram funds in the 2000-2001 budget so that rezoning can occur as soon as
possible, including a senior planner to be in communication with them and
assist in the process.


Lisa Pagan


- Project Manager with Mission Housing Development
Corporation


- She is a planner with a masters in City Planning from UC
Berkeley and a member of MAC.


- The demands that they have are to requests a moratorium of
all market-rate housing and multimedia class developments and conversions.


- She read out loud Section 303.7 which talks about interim
zoning controls.


Dr. Concha Saucedo Martinez - Executive Director of
Instituto Familiar de la Raza


- She hears everyday, the cries of the displaced people in
the Mission District.


- Our community may be poor in profit but they are rich in
diversity, in culture and in spirit.










- They ask that the Commission listen carefully and allow
for a moratorium of office conversions and dot.com offices in the Mission, as
well as stopping illegal conversions of light-industrial commercial space into
offices.


- Would like to rezone the Mission District and provide
funds for this.


- She is anxious to hear what Mr. Green will say since he
attended the Community Meeting on June 28, 2000.


Maria Martinez


- She works at the Rent Board.


- The issue of displacement is very important.
? 
Live/work spaces are wonderful but they
don?t house people who service the City and County of San Francisco.
? 
These people cannot afford to move out and
come back to work at restaurants, cleaners, etc.


- Bidding was conducted over the computer Internet to
purchase lofts.
? 
Many low-income
families don?t have computers.


- A moratorium is important in the Mission right now but it
is more important for developers to build homes for the families.


- The Planning Commission needs a report of all the families
that are being evicted from the Mission District.


- One has to look at the lifestyles that are being displaced
in the Mission and in other areas.


Joan Holden


- She is a member of the artist community which was displaced
from North Beach in the >60s and that now is being displaced from the
Mission, after 30 years.


- She is also speaking for the Artists Alliance who got
together to form a list of demands which was presented to Director Green at the
community meeting held on June 28.


- Make the interim zoning controls that say no lofts in
industrial zones permanent.


- Define live/work lofts as housing and treat them as
housing.
? 
Allow office and residential
use in industrial areas only as accessory use to industry including arts.
? 
Define dot.com spaces as what they are --
offices.


Gloria La Riva - International Action Center


- She has lived in the Mission District for 19 years.


- There is truly a crisis that speakers have analyzed, and
as a result, have given the Commission a very important alternative for a
zoning proposal.


- They had a march in the Mission for housing last
October.
? 
Citizens and non citizens came
out to support.


- If after all this testimony today, the Commission does not
take action as needed, she promises a very powerful movement.


- Many of them live and work and struggle.


- She lives in the Mission and believes that the owner will
Ellis Act the building soon--has already sent illegal eviction notices.


- 9 adults live in one apartment to be able to afford $1,000
rent.


- The Redevelopment Agency admitted a number of years ago
that they destroyed the Fillmore and eliminated 98% of African American owned
businesses.
? 
The same is going on in
Hunters Point.


- They cannot allow anymore development in the Mission or
anywhere else.


Rachel Aoanan - Works at the International Action Center


- She works there as a political activists.


- It is very discouraging to know what is going on with the
evictions.


- It is important that people voice their opinions.


Kaira Espinoza


- She was born and raised in the Mission District.
? 
Over the years she has witnessed all the
changes taking place in the City.










- If the goal is to develop a community and give them economic
opportunities, build affordable housing, and computer training centers.
? 
There is always much talk about how poor the
Mission is.
? 
The reason the community is
poor is because of lack of training and support, no lack of high rent, low
wages and discrimination.


- As soon as Valencia Street becomes more developed, there
will be valet parking and cars can park in the middle of the street.
? 
When do residents get to park in the middle?


- There are new palm trees being planted, new parks and
lofts being built.
? 
This is the reason
why there is no money to put into affordable housing, schools and community
programs.
? 
The only people being hurt
are children and future generations.


Sue Hestor -


- Regarding Item 8 - 360 10th Street on the agenda.
? 
The Commission will vote on allowing
? 
an affordable housing building to be
demolished and instead build 6 units of upscale lofts.
? 
This vote will affect the Mission, Chinatown
-- any poor community.
? 
She would like
this project to not be approved.


- Regarding Item 10 - 673 Brannan Street on the agenda.
? 
The Commission will vote on this
? 
wether or not they have adequate information
on the largest live/work development.


- Regarding Item 11 - 1247 Harrision Street - The bus
company is moving out of San Francisco because of 64 live/work units.
? 
Is there a demand or is this more dot.com
offices? 


- Item 22 - 1228 25th Street was taken off the calendar
because the developers are changing the two projects, which are next to this
site, to dot.com without any notices or any hearings.


- 580 Howard was taken off the calendar because the
developer withdrew the application.


Lloyd Schloegle


- Regarding 1247 Harrison.
?

This site is recently used as Samtrans bus parking.


- This proposal is to move the site to Pier 96.
? 
The alternative site has not been well
thought out.


- This site at Harrison Street is a poor choice for housing
since there is a freeway entrance there.


Ken Fugioka - Attorney at the Asian Law Caucus


- Every day people are being evicted from San Francisco.


- Regarding 360 10th Street.
? 
There will be a demolition of two housing units.


- This is a terrible reversal where in one situation
live/work is considered not housing not required to fulfill other requirements
that other housing is required to make and on the other hand replacing housing
with live/work space.


- The Commission is ready to lift it?s requirement for the
house that is being demolished without fulfilling the requirements of existing
policy.


- These standards were made to protect housing throughout
the city.


- For this commission to approve the demolition and replace
it with live/work space is a real travesty.


- He urges this commission to take a second look at this
development or to reject it as a whole.


Jennifer Freedomback


- She lives on Harrison Street.


- There were 500 people outside protesting in front of City
Hall who wanted to speak but instead sent in delegates of MAC.


- She wants to comment as a resident of the Mission.


- As new developments are coming and new people are moving
in, there has been an increase of desirability and a direct link to Ellis Act
evictions and other evictions that have taken place that have driven up the
rents.


- She would like to reinforce a moratorium on the Mission
District.

???????? 
COMMISSIONERS?
QUESTIONS AND MATTERS


 


5.
???????? 
Commission
Matters


 


Commissioner Antenore:
??????? 
This
morning?s Chronicle had an article about the new procedures under CEQA and the
various charges and fees proposed.
?

Would like to schedule this issue on the agenda prior to the Board of
Supervisor?s August 1 hearing to discuss this matter.


 


It would be a good idea to allow written comments to come in
a few days after the oral testimonies following draft EIR hearings.
? 
This would give people an opportunity to hear
the oral testimonies and still have time to submit further written
comments.
? 
This would be important
especially in controversial EIRs.
? 
Ms.
Gitelman mentioned that she had no objection to going back to that procedure.


 


Commissioner Mills:
?? 
Would like to schedule a hearing on
the Mission District Moratorium to hear from all sides.
? 
For a long time the Mission has been
pleading for jobs which they are now getting yet they come with impacts on
transportation and affordable housing.
?

There are millions of dollars in the Mayor?s Office of Housing and it
would be interesting to see how this gets spent. Information needs to be
brought to the Commission that helps frame the issue.
? 
Next week, staff should be prepared with a date when a hearing
will be scheduled.


 


Would like a recommendation on the definition of
live/work.
? 
She believes that it should
be called housing; this would abolish the interim definition that has created
so much difficulty.
? 
A clarification
should be made on two policies that are conflicting: 1) policies that try to
protect housing from demolition to keep affordable housing; and 2) policies
that ask to increase density along major transit routes and transit hubs.
? 
Changes and/or prioritizing need to be made
in order to avoid any conflicts.


 


Commissioner Richardson:
??? 
She is inclined to rezone the
mission district.
? 
Rather than looking
at isolated cases, planning the entire district should be the start.
? 
A map should be made of the district.


 


D.
???????? 
DIRECTOR?S
REPORT


 


6.
???????? 
Director?s
Announcements


 


Gerald Green:
? 
Response to
Demands made by the Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition:


He complements the Mission Anti-displacement Coalition for a
very well organized and focused meeting held on June 28, where he as well as Commissioners
Richardson, Mills and Chinchilla attended.


- The Commission and the department did hear about the
concerns of the changes going on in the Mission: the impact on rent and lease
increases, the harm that evictions are causing, displacement issues, loss of
affordable housing, and lack of planning.


- He respects the passion that the community has for these
issues but believes that this energy is not being directed in the right
direction.










- San Francisco is experiencing phenomenal growth.
? 
San Francisco and the Mission are not the
only ones being subjected to the demands of the growth and the new technology
coming into the city.


- The challenge of the Commission and the Planning
Department is to harness this economy so that
?

San Francisco doesn?t do away with this growth.


- He believes that there is a misconception with regards to
the planning process.
? 
Land use policies
do contribute to change in the City.
?

The big picture is that there are other agencies and other members of
government that are a part of this process.
?

For example, the rent arbitration board has the ability to affect
illegal rent and lease increases.


- The City Attorney?s office, the Building Department, the
Mayor?s Office of Housing also play a big part in this.


- The Board of Supervisors plays a big part in this issue
since they approve or disapprove the budget.


- In the 80s, the Planning effort was focused on generating
land use policies which would stimulate appropriate growth.


- Today in the 90s, the challenge and the efforts should be
focusing on guiding this growth.


- He takes offence that the department is not being guided
by the General Plan (GP).
? 
The GP is a
guiding light.
? 
It is contained in each
of the recommendations.


- The department is very much aware of the fact that state
law requires that no determination, no approval be made unless it be found to
be in conformity with the general plan.
?

The General Plan was developed with a great deal of input by various communities
and neighborhoods of this City.


- A request was made at the June 28 meeting for him to
authorize a moratorium yet he doesn?t have
?

the authority to do so.


- He would remind this commission and others that at this
time last year, the Commission was considering the live/work issue as well as
policies and controls.
? 
A moratorium was
discussed yet the Commission was concerned about a moratorium and a decision
was made not to establish one.


- In January the Planning Department will be back before the
public to discuss their work program for the next fiscal year.
? 
Now is the time to discuss what should be
put on that work program.


- If there are illegal conversions, the department will go
after them.


- There is an agreement that there should be more of a
community-based focus in Planning.
? 
The
department will make that happen.
?

Discussions should be conducted now regarding this issue.


- He is willing to work with the Mission Anti-Displacement
Coalition along with others throughout the City to do better planning.


 


Status of the American Can Company (ACC):


- Andrea Wong was assigned to investigate evictions of ACC.


- The department after receiving numerous requests,
conducted a background search, permit history, and site visit.
? 
The site visit was conducted last Friday
(7/6/00) because the property owner
? 
did
not make it easy for the department to access the site.


- There is a tenant, a bakery, who is occupying some space
at this location but there is no conversion going on there [this space].


- The Building Department has stopped permits.


- There has been some conversion of this building to office
use.


- The permit history is very extensive so the Department
will be going into more detail.


 


Status of the Bay View Bank:


- The department did accelerate the investigation process of
this building.


- This building was originally developed and occupied by Bay
View Bank in 1961.
? 
Bay View Bank sold
the building but leased the entire building back in 1981.
? 
In 1999, the Court Family purchased the
building from the previous owner.
? 
At
that time, the lease for Bay View Bank expired and they left the building in
June of this year.
? 
The new tenant is
BigStep.com.










- The issue of the impact of the non-profits is quite
real.
? 
The Court Family and BigStep.com
are prepared to work with the neighborhood to ensure that there will be space
available for non-profits.
? 
This space
will be offered at an affordable rate.


 


The Budget Process:


- The Finance Committee did not agree with the Department on
the recommendation of the work program and budget.
? 
Especially in regards to a position requested to meet the demands
of the Sunshine Ordinance.


- He still believes that the position is needed and
? 
is important and will be working with the
Supervisors and try for a reconsideration and re-evaluation.


 


Lombard Corridor
:


- The Department is requesting additional funding to carry
out a study of the Lombard Corridor.
?

Approximately $35,000 is being added by Supervisor Newsom to study the
issues of land use control.


- Supervisor Brown is asking for an increase in the budget
by $300,000 to be able to complete the
?

Transit Oriented Development Plans for Balboa Park Area.


- Supervisor Becerril and others are interested in adding an
appropriate figure to help the Department carry out the efforts of the Better
Neighborhoods 2002 program.
? 
The study
for the Mission District might be able to be carried out sooner.


 


Other items which will be discussed next week:


- Permit Processing Procedures requested by Commissioner
Chinchilla


- Status of the Affordable Housing Fund


 


Hillary Gitelman


- Regarding update to Chapter 31 of the Administrative Code.


- There was to have been a hearing this morning at one of
the Board committees but it has been postponed to August 1.


- The Chapter is severely out-of-date.
? 
It has not been amended for 10 or so
years.
? 
The state law has changed
multiple times.
? 
This has been in the
Department?s to-do list for a very long time--to bring it in conformance with
state laws.


 


- Supervisor Kaufman has been working her way through the
code trying to streamline the code--take out unnecessary sections and make
improvements where necessary.


- The Legislation will be heard on August 1.
? 
It will have little or no affect with the
way the Department or the Commission treats environmental issues.
? 
With only one exception: a procedure that
EIR?s be appealable by the Board of Supervisors
? 
which is mandated by state law.
?

The fee for this would be $1,000.
?

Ms. Gitelman believes that this fee is not out-of-line.

Appeal of a Preliminary Negative Declaration

for a proposal to demolish an existing one-story building containing a
preschool and community meeting room, and construct a new four-story building
containing eight senior housing units, a preschool and community meeting room.

(Continued from Regular Meeting of April 6, 2000).


 


SPEAKER(S):


(-)
Mary Glennon


-
She has been a resident of 9th Avenue for many years.


-
She filed an appeal to the Negative Declaration along with Dr. Deito in July of
1999.










- They
were motivated to file this appeal because they thought that their issues had
not been taken seriously by the project sponsor.


-
The PND memorandum issued in July of 2000, stated that they had not supplied
any evidence that would support the facts on the impact to the environment.


-
Although they don?t have the evidence, they are aware of what the increase in
density, parking and traffic means in an urban area when housing increases.


-
9th Avenue is a particularly busy thoroughfare since it serves as an alternate
route to 7th and 19th Avenue.


-
They were interested in speaking with SHARP yet SHARP was not very interested
about their concerns.


-
The latest plans show a much smaller building.


-
They are not trying to block a development on a property owned by SHARP.
? 
They own the property and are allowed to
develop as they wish.
? 
Yet the new
design of the building still proposes a precedent which will impact future
developments in the neighborhood.

Her
garden back up to the proposed project lot.


-
She has a Monterey pine that she planted 25 years ago.
? 
She will lose the tree if construction is
approved for the proposed development.


-
The height of the proposed building is too large.
? 
This will shut out light from her home.


-
The noise level, loss of privacy, loss of the tree, along with parking problems
will make this less than livable for her.

-
She has lived 80 years in San Francisco and 42 years in the Sunset

9TH AVENUE
, east
side between Moraga and Noriega Streets; Lots 31 and 32 in Assessor?s Block
2041 - Request for a Conditional Use authorization to allow a child care
facility, community facility and eight units of senior housing under Planning
Code Sections 209.1(m), 209.3(f) and 209.4(a), within an RH-2 (House,
Two-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District. 
?
Preliminary Recommendation: Approval
with conditions


(Continued from Regular Meeting of April 6, 2000).


 


SPEAKER(S):


(+)
Erick McJohn - Lives at 1670 8th Avenue


- He
has lived in the inner sunset for 23 years.


- He
is vice president of SHARP.


-
SHARP is a 91 year old charitable and neighborhood organization.
? 
The boundaries of SHARP are: north is
Lincoln Avenue, west is 19th Avenue, south is Riviera, and border with Forest
Hill.


- In
1947 the organization purchased two buildings.










In
1997 they remodeled in order to accommodate the displaced children from Lone
Mountain College.
? 


-
SHARP?s revenues are derived from membership fees and from the revenue from the
day care center.


-
For about 10 years, SHARP has been working on a new building concept in order
to:
? 
1) continue with the Lone Mountain
Day Care Center on the g round floor;
?

2) construct a community room where SHARP members can meet; and 3) add a
new element which is 8 senior housing units.
?

These units will be below market rates.


-
This area is a transit rich area.


(+)
Beverly Pryer - Project Architect


-
She has been a long term inner sunset resident.
? 
She has also been an active person in the community. 


-
The goals of the project are for it to be a mixed-use, neighborhood-serving
facility.


-
The proposal is for a children?s center, parking on the first floor, 8 units of
senior housing on the
? 
second and third
floors, a community room and senior social room on the 4th floor.


-
The architectural goals are that it fit into the community in terms of it?s
massing, be a good neighbor to adjacent properties by minimizing the impact on their
light and air, provide a good quality of life for the seniors, children and
community who use the facility.


(+)
Doris E. Lindfors - Lives at 1734 9th Avenue


-
She and her husband have lived there for 27 years.


- At
first they were against the project because of the lack of parking but after
much thought, they decided to support the project since housing for seniors is
needed.


-
The project is accessible by transit and has a grocery close by.


- It
is very well run, especially the child care center.


(+)
John Barry - President of SHARP


-
Seniors are the most at risk for being able to find housing.


-
This project will provide senior housing with out them worrying about Ellis
Acts or being thrown out.
? 
SHARP has
been around for 91 years.
? 
They?re not
going anywhere.


-
Commissioner Antenore asked about the 4th Floor social room.
? 
This room is necessary because the seniors
need a social center.


-
They don?t have any money coming to them from any federal or state grant.
? 
They are grateful to their forbearers for
the fact that they bought the land--otherwise they couldn?t afford to go
through with this project.


-
The 4th floor space is about 1/3 or the space below.


-
They will be having some sort of methodology to choose people who will be
living there.
? 
They haven?t settled on a
specific method.


(+)
Chooi Eng Grosso


-
She resides on 7th Avenue


-
Her first involvement with SHARP was when she was trying to save the open space
at 7th and Lawton.
? 
The president of
SHARP immediately paid for the rent of the facility and offered the free use of
the SHARP facilities as long as they needed it.


-
Ms. Grosso became interested in SHARP when she realized that elderly people
need to be accompanied with other seniors and people to take care of them in
case of an emergency.
? 
Another reason is
because children should be able to be close to their grandparents.


- As
a member of SHARP, she realizes that it?s difficult to accommodate all of the
neighbor?s needs and issues.
? 
Some of
the issues can be accommodated yet others can?t.


(+)
Jaqueline Shorewal
? 
- Secretary of SHARP


-
During the 1989 earthquake, her and her husband came home and saw how everyone
seemed lost.


-
SHARP provided assistance and helped them with no obligation.


-
SHARP is not some private club, it has an ideal and it works in that direction.










(+)
Brad Paul


- He
does not live in the Sunset but he found out about the project two years
ago.
? 
He was attracted to the idea of
combining affordable senior housing and child care in a location close to a
number of MUNI lines.


-
Many seniors as they get older cannot handle a large home.
? 
So it?s nice to have a place for seniors to
live and not have to maintain a full house.


-
Having a place where people can socialize is an important issue since it gets
harder and harder for seniors to go out.


-
The fact that the project sponsors are trying to meet the inclusionary
condition and make one of the units affordable is admirable.
? 
He volunteered to work with them to go to
some of the foundations and organizations in the City to get some funding for
what is a unique, model project. By doing this SHARP doesn?t have to cover the
loss of income for the inclusionary housing.


(+)
Jake McGoldrick


-
About 7 or 8 months ago, John Barry asked him to come and look at the
site.
? 
SHARP has always been very
generous for allowing members of the community to use their facilities.


(+)
John Bardis


-
Back in the 40s people in the neighborhoods were able to mobilize their
resources and really create a community center with their own resources.


-
The demolition moratorium which was pushed through the Board of Supervisors
back about 12 yeas ago, was
? 
demolition
of sound housing, was actually conceived and implemented through the meetings
at the SHARP club house.


- He
was the president of SHARP back in the early 70s.


(+)
Maryann Miller - member of the board of SPEAK


-
SPEAK is a neighborhood group in the same area as SHARP.


-
The meeting room on the 4th floor is not that big.


-
SPEAK is very interested always in reviewing projects for their design qualities.
? 
Because the project is well design and will
fit into the neighborhood, every square inch that is there is needed.


(+)
Rebecca Silverberg


-
This is a very unique project. It?s a project that contains multi generational
services, community services and senior housing.


-
She would like the Commission to support this project


(+)
Ramona Albright


-
She is a pro bono planning activist and has a good understanding of the
enormity of the responsibilities the Commissioners have.


-
Members of SHARP are sunset heights sensitive people.
? 
She worked with SHARP for years in the city-wide coalition for
San Francisco neighborhoods as a delegate from Twin Peaks.
? 
The CSFM sponsored their current president,
John Barry, to serve on the Commission for San Francisco?s Environment.
? 
Mr. Barry also created the first recycling
program in the City.


-
CSFM members believe that Mr. Barry would not sponsor a project without merit.


-
The project will provide improved child care, community meeting facilities and
urgently-needed senior housing.


-
The current SHARP center has always been community-serving and
City-serving.
? 
The new facility will
serve the residents of this City for generations to come.


-
SHARP has tried for so long with repeatedly altered specifications to get the
approval of the Department.


(-)
Dr. Dai To


-
She is a geriatrics psychology fellow at the Goldman Institute on Aging in San
Francisco.
? 
She and her husband live
next door to the proposed project.


-
She has a lot of interest in this development.
?

The development will have tremendous impact on her and her family on
many levels.










-
The subject of older adults is close to her heart.
? 
Not only is she sympathetic to the needs of seniors but also
understands the difficulties and challenges this population faces living and
growing older in San Francisco.


-
Her opposition to the proposed project has never been anti-senior housing.
? 
The scope, the size and the density of the
project is too much.
? 
The project has 8
units of senior housing but also a preschool space, and the addition of a
community room.
? 
There are 3 distinct
uses crammed into the middle of an already congested block.
? 
The scope of the project as a whole is not
compatible with the neighborhood.


-
Please consider their concerns and ask SHARP to downsize their project.


-
There is no doubt that affordable housing is necessary for seniors but is this
what this project will really provide?
?

The proposed community room is seen as a benefit to the community, but
is it really?


-
Before judgement can be made about how necessary, beneficial, and how
community-oriented this project is, the following must be considered: 1) SHARP
is a neighborhood organization that denied membership to neighbors who tried to
join this group; 2) a board member was excluded from their meetings because
this person lives on the block and shared the concerns of the neighbors who
opposed the project; 3) the same board has also said to concerned neighbors and
to reporters that their members will have first priority to the housing units.


-
SHARP has presented itself as a private club.
?

Is this project really beneficial to seniors? Or is this a way to
provide housing and a meeting room to the members of their private club.


(-)
Owen Pittman - Lives at 1734 9th Avenue


- He
agrees with everything Dr. Dai To said.
?

He has been here for a long time.


-
There are two things that bothers him: 1) the proposed site will attach itself
to his building, there is an alleyway that will be blocked.
? 
In case of fire or emergency services it
will be blocked.
? 
2)
? 
the fact that a 4 story unit will block all
of the stair wells from light.
? 
They
will be living in a tomb.


ACTION:
????????? 
Intent
to approve with the following conditions:
?

staff to report on July 20, 2000 the following: 1) affordability
component of the project; and 2) use of 4th floor meeting room.

LIQUOR
STORE AMENDMENT
 -
Consideration of a proposal to amend the Planning Code (Zoning Ordinance) by
amending each of the Neighborhood Commercial District zoning control tables in
Article 7 to add a use category called ALiquor Store@ and to make such stores
either a permitted use, a conditional use, or not permitted and by adding
Section 790.55 to define ALiquor Store@.
?

Preliminary Recommendation: 
Approval
 
Approve amendments
and recommendation of adoption to the Board of Supervisors.


 


SPEAKER(S):


(-)
Tod Priest - California Grocers Association










-
This association represents retail grocers


- He
supports the measure of defining Aliquor store@ but he believes the definition
is too broad.


- He
met with Planning staff and their recommendation was for the Commission to go
forward with the definition of a liquor store but try to figure out a way to
craft it so that it is truly a liquor store. (e.g. Safeway is not a liquor
store, they are a full-service grocery
?

yet sell liquor).


- If
this is moved forwarded to the BOS as presented, every retailer no matter what
their size or what their business, whether they have a license 20 or 21, would
be deemed a liquor store.


(+)
Ralf Mueller - Member of the Inner Sunset Merchants Association


- He
is in support of this proposal.


(-)
Dick Millet - Potrero Boosters Neighborhood Association


-
ABC is not very good about notification and help.


-
When liquor stores have closed, Potrero Boosters have had to keep all the
records because ABC keeps losing documents.


- To
open a liquor store you have to have the police department?s approval.
? 
Unless new owners are told to, they
generally don?t go to the neighborhoods to ask for approval.


-
His neighborhood has very small commercial neighborhood districts -- liquor
stores are located one next to the other.


-
When they come into the neighborhood, there should be a requirement of giving
special notification so that they have time in order to protest them.


-
Maybe a conditional use should be decided on so that the neighborhood can be
notified and
? 
respond.

9th Avenue) with no address (1763/044), and


<
        

use controls intended to ameliorate conditions associated with the
proliferation of commercial establishments in and about the Inner Sunset
Neighborhood Commercial District.


Preliminary Recommendation: 
Approval
 
Approve amendments and
recommendation of adoption to the Board of Supervisors.


 


SPEAKER(s):


(-)Chooi
Eng Grosso
 
-
member of SHARP


-
She has heard the Planning staff 3 times.
?

The first time at the Coalition of San Francisco Neighborhoods, the second
time at the Land Use Committee Meeting and the third time at the SHARP monthly
meeting.
? 
Staff spent a lot of time with
them going through the changes.










-
Her only problem with this is that the medical services on the first floor has
been changed from permitted to not permitted and on the second floor it has
been changed from permitted to conditional.
?

The concern is that they might be overwhelmed with medical services
because they are so close to UCSF.
? 


-
She would suggest that they retain the first floor as permitted or
conditional..


(-)
John Barry - President of SHARP


- He
lives 3 blocks away from the lots on 10th Avenue.
? 
He concurs that the lots have always bee nothing but residential
and should stay that way.


- He
doesn?t believe that these lots should be allowed to be commercial.


- If
a person needs an ophthalmologist, it would be difficult for them to go up the
stairs.


- He
believes that the conditional use should be based on a case by case basis.


(+)
Rolf Mueller - Inner Sunset Merchants Association


- His
office is in the next block of the three buildings.


- There
is no business going on in those buildings.


- He
supports the proposal but would also like to include allowing a small
self-service restaurant as a conditional use.


(+) Maryann
Miller - Board Member of Speak


- She
recommends that the west part of 19th to 26th Avenue be subject to similar
controls. That area needs attention.


- 9th and
Irving is a wonderful, thriving commercial district.
? 
Hopefully it won?t take another 3 years.
? 
It hasn?t suffered from those out-of-scale
uses.


- One of
the really good things about the proposal is that in the proposed district,
there would be a use size for any use, permitted up to 2,500 or 2,499 square
feet, then after that, it would be a conditional use.
? 
That way the neighbors don?t have to fight everything.


- If
medical services should be on the first floor, then the first floor should be a
conditional use.


- The 3
lots on 10th and Irving, are rightly residential.
? 
They should be removed from the commercial district.
? 
A staff initiated zoning change might have
to be requested.


ACTION:
????????? 
Intent
to Approve with the following amendments:
?

1) move the medical services category to a conditional use as opposed to
a not permitted use; 2) move the self service restaurant to conditional use;
and
? 
3)
 
initiate a proposal to
rezone the three residential parcels on 10th Avenue from NCD to RH-2.

Jobs Housing Linkage Legislation


- The department is targeting
September 14 or September 24 for Commissioners to decide on legislation.


 


There are a few items on the action
list that need to be clarified:


- Commissioner Chinchilla and
Theoharis requested information on the modification of building permits plans
after a decision by the Commission has been made--coordination with the
Building Department and the Planning Department is of issue.
?? 
With the assistance of the Building
Department, an informational presentation will be scheduled for August 3.


 


- Commissioner Antenore requested
information on the impact of the conversion of live/work.
? 
With the help of the ZA, an informational
presentation will be scheduled for September 7.










- Commissioner Theoharis requested
information on the status report on 955 Green Street.
? 
Staff will be prepared to make a presentation on August 3.
? 
Staff is somewhat limited on the information
because of a lawsuit against the City.


 


- Ms. Isolda Wilson has been
assigned to assist the ZA and the Director.
?

She has already shown her ability to take on this position in special
assignments.

Status Report on Proposed
Legislation to Update Chapter 31 of the San Francisco Administrative Code.


 


SPEAKER(S):


Sue Hestor:


- She doesn?t agree with the way
this case was put on the calendar.
? 
Did
not feel that the calendar language was not sufficient to inform those that
might have been interested about the components of the proposed legislation.
? 
Everyone involved with the Planning Commission
were not made aware and therefore could not be involved.


- Proposed $1,000 fee is too much.


- $400 is the fee to appeal a ZA
determination.


- The Commission needs to make
decisions for themselves and not let staff influence it.


Bernard Choden


- He is amazed by the egregious
aspects of the barrier to administrative justice.
? 
This is an illegal process.


Ralph House - Bay View Hill
Neighborhood Association


- He read in the newspaper about the
fee proposed for an environmental report.


- At the same time he read the
article, he was getting ready to file a Negative Declaration.


- The Commission should give serious
consideration to this and realize that the people that will be concerned and
affected by the decisions made by the Commission cannot afford the $1,000 fee.


Eric Quesada - Mission
Anti-Displacement Coalition










- The community does not feel that
they are being heard by the Commission, BOS and City Hall in general.


- This makes the public not believe
in the public officials.


- $1,000 is insulting to the
community.


- The community is aware of this and
is uniting to protest and have their voices heard.


John Bardis


- As commissioners, you are
representatives of people and not the administration in reviewing how policies
are being implemented.


- The last thing that the public
would expect from representatives of the people is what was provided to the
public -- a simple one page notice which does not state anything constructive.


- An appeal is a process by which
the commission has an opportunity to hear from the public on various items.


- The people should not be penalized
by being asked to pay such a high amount of money.


Jake McGoldrick


- The Commission, as public
officials, should have the mentality of Acausing no harm.@


- Allow the public access to those
who make decisions.


- The need from the public to get
public officials to protec them is very important.


- What kind of data is presented
here?
? 
How many cases are heard?
? 


- The case deserves double scrutiny.


- Please do not increase the fee.


 


Commissioner Antenore: 
Disappointed with the way this item
was put on the agenda.
? 
He will state
his individual protest and forward it via letter to the Board of Supervisors
Committee and urges fellow Commissioners to do the same.

117 PARKER AVENUE
, west side between Euclid Avenue
and Geary Boulevard, Lot 003 in Assessor?s Block 1064 -- Request for
Discretionary Review of BPA Nos. 9912789 & 9912791, proposing to demolish
the existing single-family dwelling and the construction of a new two-story
over garage two-family dwelling in an RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family)
District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Do not
take Discretionary Review and approve the building permit applications as
revised.


Note: On June 8, 2000, following
public testimony the Commission closed the public hearing.* Matter was
continued to July 27, 2000 to get input from DBI to determine if the current
structure is sound.
? 
Staff will work
with Mr. Pantaleoni, project architect, to improve facade and make it more
compatible with the neighborhood.


*(Public testimony will be open only
to discuss any new design features submitted from the project architect).


 


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Sylvia Meliquian:


- She appreciates the effort of the
architect.
? 
The new design now jets out
further than the original design and outside of the context of the surrounding
houses.
? 
The height has also been
significantly increased.
? 
The floor
heights could be reduced slightly and keep it as a high quality rental unit while
reducing the overall building height.
?

The off street parking has been eliminated due to the configuration of
the entrance and garage. She would like this to be reconsidered since parking
in San Francisco is very difficult.










(-) K. Rose Hillson:


- She appreciates the fact that the
new facade is a Victorian facade.


- Yet it is still too high.


- At the previous hearing, the DR
requestors were not able to comment on the facade since they mostly spoke about
the soundness of the current building.


- She would like the garage to be
made smaller.


- She would like commissioners to
re-consider the design of the facade.


(+) Hahn Phan - Reuben & Alter -
representing project sponsor


- At the previous hearing, the
Commission narrowed down the case to two issues 1) the DBI report 2) facade.


- DBI determined that the current
building was unsafe and that the cost of renovation would exceed 50% of new
construction.
? 
This information is
consistent with the engineer?s report which was originally submitted.
? 
It is uneconomic and unreasonable to keep
the building Aas is.@


- Regarding the design issue, the
project architect developed a scheme that saves the Victorian facade.
? 
The architect eliminated bay windows.


(+) Tony Panteleoni


- After meeting on June 9, he went
to measure the existing house.


- He tried to look at the
opportunity to extend the rear of the building and still provide 2 units behind
it.


- He looked at adding square footage
to the rear of the building.


- Because of the requirements of
providing sunlight to various rooms of the house, various light wells had to be
designed, which in turn makes the rooms a lot smaller.


- He is trying to preserve as much
of the existing facade as possible.


- The size of the garage would be
the smallest he can go.


- The size of the peaked roof can go
smaller.


 


ACTION:
?????????? 
Take DR and require:
?

1) height of peaked roof be lowered to 32 feet;
?? 
2) lower one level to 9 feet.

DISCUSSION OF HOUSING ISSUES
INCLUDING OAHPP
, an

informational presentation
 on the Residence Element of the General
Plan's approach to assessing housing need, the relationship between job growth
and housing need, and the status of the current Office Affordable Housing
Production Program (OAHPP) and how it is addressing this housing need.


 


SPEAKER(S):


Marsha Rosen - Director of the Mayor?s
Office of Housing (MOH):


- They work with the planning
department and at the Mayors request, she convenes an inter-agency and
community affordable housing planning process which the planning staff
participates in.


- There are parallel requirements
between the Commission?s responsibility to produce affordable housing under the
housing element of the General Plan and the Federal responsibility to produce a
5 year plan called the Consolidated Plan of Housing Needs and a 1 year action
plan.


- They program close to $100 million
dollars a year for affordable housing development between the Redevelopment
Agency and MOH.
? 
They use a variety of
Federal and local funds.
? 
The local
funds include part of the hotel tax and Proposition A.
?? 
The Redevelopment Agency sets aside between
40 and 50% of all tax increment funds available.
?? 
MOH administers the Federal Community Development Block Grant
Program, The Home Investment Partnership Act Program, portion of the Kenney
Homeless Act Program, The Housing Opportunity for Persons with AIDS, etc.
? 
All of the units are targeted to low and
extremely low income households.


- MOH will always need more
resources and they always need better ways to coordinate amongst agencies.


- Now that MOH is aware of a new
influx of money, they will be preparing another notice of funding availability
of housing/rental housing so that those dollars can go out into the field and
build housing as intended.


- No matter what is done on new growth,
they still have to aggressively try to meet a huge backlog.
? 
Otherwise, they won?t be able to meet their
goals.


Joe LaTorre:


- MOH does annual housing
monitoring.
? 
Currently there are about
140 units (mostly home-ownership but there are about 20 or 30 rental
units).
? 
This does not include
developments which are under construction, or still in the marketing stage.


- Within a year or two the 140 units
will probably reach 300.


Bernard Choden


- He has been a proprietor of the
housing systems program since he helped develop it for Jerry Brown.


- This is a contract; these are
administrative policies intended to be preformed.


Lloyd Schloegle










- The Residence Element has been
revised.
? 
Policy statements 1 and 2
under the heading of ASupply of New Housing@ suggests promoting affordable
housing on surplus, under-used and vacant public lands as well as facilitate
the conversion of under-used commercial and industrial areas to residential use
giving preference to affordable housing uses.
?

Some of the proposals under the guidelines are foolish -- for example:
near freeways, by light rail tracks, and useful downtown parking lots.
? 
Some of these places are unsuitable for
housing developments.


Jake McGoldrick


- The right questions need to be
asked.


- We shouldn?t constrain ourselves
in regards to affordable housing.


- Oakland is the natural place for
jobs to go.


- Mayor Brown of Oakland is dying to
see more development on housing.


Sue Hestor


- The Commission is part of the
problem as well as the solution.


- The IPZ hasn?t been rezoned.


- The actions of the Commissioners
have consequences.


- There is a 1997 nexus which has
not been implemented.


- The Commissioners are responsible
and their votes will decide.


John Bardis


- Would like to have literature on
the presentation which could be available to the public.


- Agrees with the idea of having a
joint hearing with Planning, Redevelopment and MOH.


- Staff should look at the process
by which ABAG gets their projections.


- This is too important a subject to
limit it with a visual presentation.


Eric Quesada


- This information has been lacking
in getting to the community.


- This type of presentation is good
to be presented to the community.


- This information can?t stay here,
it needs to get out into the community.


Ina Glim


- She agrees with the other speakers
in regards to presenting this information to the community.


- The public has fought very hard
for inclusionary housing.


- When these projects are developed,
they never know how many units are targeted for low income.


- There is a project on Van Ness
Avenue, but how many units are affordable?


- There needs to be something done
in regards to the marketing of these low income housing developments.

a total of four panel antennae in two stealth speakers with the base
transceiver station to be located in storage space under the bleachers, as part

?

Preliminary Recommendation: Approve with conditions, including
adopting a finding of conformity with the General Plan for the proposed project

SPEAKER(S):


 


(+) Robert Crebs - Project Sponsor
representing Sprint PCS


- The conditional use petition
complies with the WTS Sighting Guidelines and the San Francisco Municipal Code.


- This site is a preference 1.


- Over 100 organizations and tenants
were notified to attend a community hearing yet no one attended.


- There was a second community
hearing and only one person attended.


- The proposed installation is
necessary to provide cell communication within 3COM park.


- 1/3 of 911 calls come in from cell
phones.


- He would like this project to be
approved.


(-) Ralph House - Bayview Hill
Neighborhood Association


- There is a lack of interest from
the community because he believes the community doesn?t understand the
technology of cell phone communications.


- There are some health problems
with using cell phones.
? 
Sprint PCS has assured
that digital technology is less harmful.


- There have been 5 installations
approved in the area, some include antennas, switching stations/transition
stations, etc.


(-) Ina Glim


- She came to speak on item 17 but
this item involves the same problem.


- She is from the Nob Hill
neighborhood.


- In the last week she has received
3 notices of installations in Nob Hill.


- The building that she lives in is
proposed for antenna installation.


- Commercial buildings are not of
concern, but when it comes to residential buildings, where there are children
and people with health problems, it can be a problem.


- Cumulative affects are never
talked about.


(-) Gary Briggs


- His concern is that he made a
special trip to talk about Item 17, yet it was canceled.


- He lives in a building that he
owns and he received a notice from the Planning Department because he lives
within 300 feet of a proposed site for antenna installation.


- There is a problem with the
mailing of notices since it appears that notices are being sent to residents
and not building/property owners.


- Hearings are scheduled during the
day which makes it difficult for people to leave their jobs to attend the
meeting.


- He would like a notice sent to
people in regards to procedures for Discretionary Reviews.


Bill Hammut










- There was a misunderstand with the
report that staff gave: there is a figure of 6% - that is the value of the
nearest seats under the antennas.
? 
There
is an additional safety factor in that area of 16 times.
? 
The levels in the neighborhoods are
negligible.
? 
They?ll be tens of
thousands of times below the standard.
