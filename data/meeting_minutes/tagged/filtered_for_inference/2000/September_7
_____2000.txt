Robert McCarthy - law office of
McCarthy and Schwartz - representing Project Sponsor, Metricom


- Two meetings were held at the Mission Cultural
Center.
? 
One in the afternoon and one in
the evening.


- One person, who spoke English, suggested that the
meeting be bilingual.


- He feels that they have adequately notified the
neighbors.


- The location is a preference 1 location since it?s
a switching station for a Pac Bell building.


- Because this is a sensitive issue, he will look
into the matter of finding out how many people speak different languages.


(-) Christine Haupert-Wemmer


- The language notification is an issue.


- The meetings were held in the Mission District, yet
Metricom stated they didn?t know most of the residents spoke other
languages.

Yet, the district is mostly
Hispanic.

English-speaking residents because they understood the notice.

She believes that there would have been more
residents who could have attended the meeting if the notices were bilingual.


(-) Elizabeth Bell


- She quoted a statement from the Planning Department
Guidelines on antennas.


- If this application is approved, there will be 22
antennas in one location, making the location an antenna farm.


- She would like to request from the Board of
Supervisors that they pass legislation that no more antennas would be installed
at this location.


(-) Pat Gerber


- She would like to address the fact that the posters
placed on the site of the building were incorrect since 1045 Capp Street is a
Senior Citizen center for Latinos.


- Although the site is a preference 1 location, it is
only because there is a Pacific Bell building.


- She would like to request a variance be sought for
this building.


(-) Daryll (last name unclear)

Re:

Consequences of stopping live/work developments


- How would the situation be if
live/work developments did not exist.


- Instead of protesting live/work
developments, energy and money should be focused on educating the youth of our
City.


- If we read the paper and see that
down in Redwood City kids from high school are making 40k a year joining
technology companies and then telling the youth of the Mission District that
they will only be able to get blue-collar jobs in those same companies.


- As an incentive to developers, if
they are given incentives to provide more developments, any developer would not
have a problem with contributing to job training programs for the youth in the
area.


Thomas Egan


Re: Reason why people are against
live/work developments


- When he is involved with
developments, he has to deal not only with the architect but also with the
people in the surrounding area.
? 


- He spends a lot of money trying to
please the neighbors so the development can go forward and there will not be a
need for Discretionary Reviews. 


- Yet, it is difficult to please
everyone and therefore people begin to protest.


John O?Donaghue


Re: Developments in the City


- The testimony of protesters
regarding live/work developments sounds as if he had committed a cardinal sin.


- They have sinned because they have
provided housing in a City with a housing crisis, because they have provided
blue collar jobs to many immigrants
?

with limited English, because they have added to the property tax base
so they can increase the social programs; because they have paid to the school
fund; because they have turned industrial wasteland and developed housing; and
they want to be good providers to they families.


A. Curtis Eisenberger - President of
Mariposa Development


Re: Developments in the City


- They are located in the Mission
District.
? 
They make room for
businesses, live/work and non-profits.
?

Their work force has a large number of minorities.


- Dealing with this City is
extremely difficult.


- We are facing a housing

Re: 175 Langton Street


- He has attended many of the

informed of the most current events.


- At the BOA hearing last Wednesday,
the attorney for Coalitions for Arts, Jobs and Housing testified that his
building 175 Langton Street had been converted into a dot.com rental building.


- Ms. Hestor perhaps did not
investigate the facts before making allegations as she did.


- People who speak at these hearings
should adopt the same procedures by the BOA and swear in all the witnesses so
they testify under oath.

- This Commission has been
instructed to make decisions for the best interest of the public.


- He is concerned with the families
and children of the residents of the Mission because they are being displaced.

constructs one building at a time.

developments are good.


- He attends Planning Commission
meetings when he can.


- He would like for the Commission
to not keep changing their minds.


Jerry Klein


Re: Housing


- He has been involved in the
planning process for over 20 years.


- He understands that there are
difficult problems the commission needs to face at every meeting.


- The choice has always been
anti-housing.
?

Joe O?DONAGHUE


Re: Misstatements from speakers


- A statement was made blasting the
Commission.


- People are constantly complaining
and making allegations that are not true.

installation buildings.


Valerie Tulier - Latino Steering
Committee


Re: People in the Mission are
suffering


- She came to the Commission not to
speak but was motivated to do so because of something that a
? 
previous speaker said.


- It is a sin not to build housing
for the poor or working class, not to build affordable housing, not to take
into account the community?s needs, to have an arrogant attitude and not
respect the culture of a neighborhood. 


William F.
? 
Wilson


Re: He is against treatment people
receive at hearings
.


- He came last week to a commission
meeting on a particular case.


- The item was never heard because
after he sat there for 3 hours he had another commitment he had to keep.


- He tried to find out what had
happened to the item and found out that it was continued.
? 
He was upset by that but he was more upset
when people are pouring out their hearts and the Commission didn?t want to hear
them.
? 
Today there are a lot of personal
attacks and this is not justified.


Mack Burton


Re: The City needs more jobs.


- He came to the commission a few
years ago to request more developments that create more jobs.


- He commends the Commission for
their hard work.


- It is very important to create
jobs because this is a positive impact on everyone.










- He now owns his own company and
can provide jobs for people. 


Bernard Thomas


Re: He believes in the system of the
Commission


- He brought a few people a while
back so they could understand the system of the Planning Commission.


- He realized that in order to
understand the system, people need to participate in the system.


- He believes that the Commission is
doing a great job and have conducted meetings in an orderly fashion.


Michael Forkin - Manager of First
American Title Company


Re: Live/Work Developments
??? 


- He has employed about 70 people,
many are single mothers.
? 
The salary of
these employees are generated by the money which is put into funds by live/work
developments. 


- When decisions are made by the
Commission, realize that there are impacts that the Commission may not see
weather it be positive or negative.


Eamon Hezlihy


- The only low-cost housing being
built is being built by his company.


- He has lived in the Mission
District and has had many projects
? 
in

Status
Report of the Smith-Kettlewell Institute.


 


There has been an ongoing concern
with the Smith-Kettlewell Institute properties (2209, 2238, 2244 and 2250-2252
Webster, 2389 Washington, 2470 Clay Street). In January of 2000, the members of
the Webster Street Historic District came to the Landmark?s Advisory Board and
informed them of the deteriorating condition of the houses.
? 
In March of 2000, Landmark?s Board requested
the Commission to initiate enforcement procedures.
? 
In May of 2000, Staff was contacted that the houses were
deteriorating and that there was misuse by the institution.
? 
In June of 2000, staff initiated a letter of
violation.
? 
In July of 2000, it was
confirmed that there was unauthorized uses by the institution.
? 
In August of 2000, the BOS initiated a
resolution for Smith-Kettelwell to comply with the Planning Department.


 


John Sanger - Sanger and Olson -
Representing Smith-Kettlewell Eye Institute.


- They are indeed anxious to
cooperate with the City.










- He will be meeting with the Zoning
Administrator next week.


- The Institute is looking very
closely at returning 3 of the houses to residential or create an institutional
master plan.
? 


- The buildings will begin
restoration and repairs.


Donald Langley - Friends of the
Webster Street Historic District


- He would have liked to have more
people from this district but just yesterday they found out that it was going
to be on the calendar.


- 2389 Washington Street -
Smith-Kettlewell said that they have been using this as a guest house.
? 
This would still require permits.


Mark Zier
 - 
Friends of the Webster Street
Historic District


- He agrees with what Mr. Langley
said.


- He is thankful to the Commission
for having initiated this on the agenda.


Patricia Vaughey


- She was at the Board of Permit

There were two cases
which were not mentioned by Mr. Badiner: 20 6th Street 


- People come with plans and application
forms.
? 
The Department sends out a 311
notice.
? 
Then there is a change in
plans.
? 
So what was sent out first no
longer reflects what changes have been made.
?

Should revisions be accepted after the 311 has gone out?


- There was another case: 537 Divisadero.
? 
Staff rejected this as outside their
jurisdiction.


Joe O?Donaghue


- He lives in the area.
? 
He has no problem with the check cashing
facility.

Live/Work Development
 -- 
Appeal of a Preliminary Negative Declaration
: The
project site is located on Block 3612, Lot 2, at 2412 Harrison Street between
20th and 21st Streets and adjacent to the San Francisco Recreation and Parks
Department's Mission Center.
? 
The
project sponsor proposes to demolish the two existing commercial warehouse
buildings (2-stories and 1-story, respectively), a total of 16,736 square feet.
The project sponsor proposes to construct a 40-foot high 3-story building
containing parking and live/work units on the ground floor and live/work units
on the upper floors for a total of 28 parking spaces and 28 live/work
units.
? 
New construction would total
about 50,140 square feet, of which approximately 36,370 square feet would be
live/work space, 3,470 square feet would be common area (including circulation
and lobby), and 10,300 square feet would be a ground-floor parking garage (28
independently accessible off-street parking spaces, one (1) off-street loading
space, mechanical space and tenant storage).
?

The proposed building would have 100% lot coverage at the ground
level.
? 
The upper floors would be set
back 15' from the rear property line.
?

The building would have an FAR of 2.6 to 1, less than the allowable
5:1.
? 
The project site is located in the
C-M Heavy Commercial Zoning District and the 40-X Height and Bulk
District.
?
