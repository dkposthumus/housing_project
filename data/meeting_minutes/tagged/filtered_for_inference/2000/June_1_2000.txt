557 FOURTH STREET
-- 
Public Hearing on
Draft Environmental Impact Report.
 On Assessor?s Block 3776, Lots 119 and
62, the project would demolish an existing building on the southeastern portion
of the 70,400-square-foot project site, subdivide the project site into 12
equal-sized air parcels, and construct a four-story, 55-foot-tall wood frame
live/work building on each air parcel. A total of 188 live/work units,
occupying approximately 227,000 square feet, would be constructed along with
approximately 13,000 square feet of retail space for four to six commercial
tenants, which would be provided on the ground floor of the two buildings with
frontage on Fourth Street. A three-level underground parking garage would
occupy the entire site and would provide 188 private parking spaces (one per
live/work unit), 292 public parking spaces, and 2 off-street loading spaces.
The garage would be accessible on Welsh and Freelon Streets in the middle of
the project block. The project site is in SLI (Service Light Industrial)
District, and is in a 50-X Height and Bulk District.

1230 - 18TH STREET
, north side, between
Texas and Mississippi Streets, Lot 013A in Assessor?s Block 4001 -- Request for
Discretionary Review of BPA No. 9912693S, proposing to add a third floor to an
existing two-story, one-unit building, setting it back approximately sixteen
feet from the existing second story, for a height of approximately 37 feet.
Additionally, the applicant would construct a two-car garage, with two garage
doors, move the existing curb cut, and make interior renovations in an
RH-3(Residential, House, Three-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk
District. Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and
approve building permit application as submitted.


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Steve Williams - Representing the DR
Requestor


- There seems to be some confusion with the
height of the buildings.


- The project property is already larger than
the other homes.


- The staff doesn?t want to talk about the
adjacent buildings.


- There are two lot line windows facing east.


- There is a lot of room for compromise and
reduction.


- The project will cause a loss of a rental
unit.


- There is no additional parking being added.


- Would like Commission to reduce the project in
size.


(-) Gary Shawley - DR Requestor


- He had intruders come into his home twice.


- The proposed structure will be an invasion of
privacy.


- There is a petition from 85 of the neighbors
to reduce the project in size.


(-) Judy Shawley - wife of DR Requestor


- They have had intruders come into their home
twice.


- Why does the proposed construction have to
have a window on the lot line?


- They have tried to compromise to no avail.


- The project is huge and out-of-scale.


(-) Leland Van Winkle
 - 
co-DR Requestor


- He has a 6-unit building across the street
from the proposed project.


- He presently enjoys an open space feeling.


- The scale of the project is so great and out
of place. The two adjacent owners would have to build up to protect or maintain
their investments - removing his open space feeling.


-The scale gives the appearance that this
project would be built by a full time developer yet this project is being done
by a first time developer.


- The construction would remove rental units,
therefore, would be decreasing affordable housing in the City.


- He would like to encourage the property owners
to be patient and go back to their first choice and find the ideal house, even
keeping 1230 18th Street as an investment but without the need of this major
construction.


(-) David Luth - Mechanical Engineer


- The guidelines stress consideration on the
impact of adjacent buildings.


- This proposal should be brought down in size.


- There is a problem with the scale of the
building in regards to shadow effect on the neighbor?s house.


(-) Ed Schumer - 13 year resident of Potrero
Hill


- Project is out of scale to the rest of the
neighborhood.


- Would like to have modest modifications to the
proposed unit.


(-) Rebecca de Guzman
 
- Tenant of one of
the studios at 1297 18th Street


- She has been a tenant there since 1994.


- She is also a member of the San Francisco
Tenants Union because she has been concerned about the loss of rental units and
decrease of the quality of life to renters in San Francisco.


- She is against the project because of the loss
of family rentals.


- It has been brought up that MUNI has approved
this but that the garage would interrupt the MUNI bus stop.


- The building addition is out of scale and not
appropriate with the rest of the neighborhood.


- Would like to urge the Commission to consider
renters and the quality of life to residents of Potrero Hill.


(+) Robert May - Project Sponsors


- There was a secret brief that was sent out to
the Commissioners and he wasn?t aware of this. There seems to be many
discrepancies in this brief.


- The DR representative states that there is a
letter from a tenant who was evicted yet he has an e-mail from the same tenant
stating that he wasn?t evicted. 


 


(+) Robert Poyas - Neighbor
 
lives at 1206 18th
Street


- 10 years ago, he went through a similar
process of a neighbor making an addition to his home.


- The property owner came to him for advice on how
to go about doing this because he wanted to be sensitive to the community.


(+) David Teeters - Project Architect


- A lot has been talked about regarding the
residential design guidelines.


- There are buildings that range from 40 to 45
feet in height on both sides of the street.


- Regarding the scale of the building, no one
has suggested what exact scale would be appropriate.


(+) John Sweeney - 10-year resident of Potrero
Hill


- He is familiar with the review process since he
protested a proposed addition - he lost the appeal and none of his concerns
were taken into consideration. After the addition was completed, he realized
that his conception of the project was not correct and his concerns were not
ignored after all.


- A year later he went to apologize to his
neighbor.


(+) Sue Mell - Tenant at 285 Texas Street


- She has lived at this rental unit since 1995.


- Has no objections or reservations regarding
the construction.


- The DR requestors have never come to her to
get her opinion.


(+) Martha Cook - 


- She is co-homeowner of proposed project.


- There was a flier that was posted throughout
the neighborhood demanding they stop the construction of their monster home.


(+) Marsha Cook


- She is the mother of Martha Cook.


- She lives in Michigan and she will be moving
into the addition of the proposed project.


- This project has been delayed several times.


ACTION: 
Take DR to make changes proposed by
ZA: Property line windows to be removed, deck to be moved to the left hand side
of the building, move ladder to the other side of the deck if building code
allows

Larry Badiner


Read the findings into the record:
The Commission took the action to deny based on 1) the potential for disruption
of transit service; 2) the potential for double parking; 3) there was no
demonstrated need for additional video rental service in the vicinity--an area
already well serviced by several other such establishments; 3) the recent
reduction from 3 to 2 traffic lanes and an the addition of bicycle traffic
mixed in with the vehicular lane would increase traffic congestion; 4)
substantial opposition expressed by neighborhood merchants and residents; 5)
the proposed validated parking would be valet style making it awkward for users
who might otherwise just double park; and 6) Polk Street is trying to establish
it?s character as a neighborhood commercial area of small local business and
there is a strong public sentiment that the proposed establishment would not be
compatible with that character.

557 FOURTH STREET
-- 
Public Hearing on Draft
Environmental Impact Report.
 On Assessor?s Block 3776, Lots 119 and 62, the
project would demolish an existing building on the southeastern portion of the
70,400-square-foot project site, subdivide the project site into 12 equal-sized
air parcels, and construct a four-story, 55-foot-tall wood frame live/work
building on each air parcel.
? 
A total of
188 live/work units, occupying approximately 227,000 square feet, would be
constructed along with approximately 13,000 square feet of retail space for
four to six commercial tenants, which would be provided on the ground floor of
the two buildings with frontage on Fourth Street.
? 
A three-level underground parking garage would occupy the entire
site and would provide 188 private parking spaces (one per live/work unit), 292
public parking spaces, and 2 off-street loading spaces.
? 
The garage would be accessible on Welsh and
Freelon Streets in the middle of the project block.
? 
The project site is in SLI
?

(Service Light Industrial) District, and is in a 50-X Height and Bulk
District. 
Note:
? 
Written comments
will be received at the Planning Department until 5:00 p.m., on June 8, 2000.




Preliminary Recommendation: No
action


(Continued from Regular Meeting of
June 1, 2000).


 


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Stan Smith 
- Secretary/Treasurer of the San
Francisco Building Construction Trades Council 


- He would like to delay the EIR for
one week.
? 
He has reason to believe that
some of the transportation study is lacking.


(-)
 
Howard Strassner - Speaking for
the Sierra Club


- Read from Proposition E because it
directly affects the work of the Commission and the Planning Department.


- The Planning Department should not
encourage big parking proposals in areas well served by transit because parking
garages draw people off transit and into cars which then impede transit.
? 
Therefore, in two ways you discourage public
transit.


- One of the first directions in the
EIR is to discuss the alternative of a smaller garage--If you have less
parking, less people would drive because there is less places for people to
park.


 


 


(-) Lloyd Schloegle


- There is no need for housing here
because it?s not a residential area.


- There are too many proposals for
housing in these areas.


- This project is not necessary and
should be rejected.


(-) Sue Hestor


- This project is in the SLI district
and does not allow housing


- The growing demand for live/work
is the justification for this project.


- Live/work projects are now being
rented out to dot.coms.


- There should be an honest analysis
in this EIR which is the Department?s current version of office and call it
business services and analyze it as being used as dot.coms.


- Was this an arson fire, which
makes this site available?


- The traffic study is the biggest
problem.


- The project seems to incorporate as
a major mitigation measure something that the Commission has no power over
which is changing the street pattern.


-Would like to get another week
because this issue involves working with transportation consultants and 4
levels of transportation summaries have to be analyzed.


(-) Jennifer Clary - Board of

- She would like additional time to
comment on the EIR.

the policy of the department since they establish an industrial protection zone
and allow uses in it that are not allowed in it.


- She really would like time to
absorb it.










(+) Alice Barkley - Representing

- She would like the EIR to be
modified since the Department of Parking and Transportation is considering
reducing Zoe Street from a two way street to a one way Street southbound at the
request of some of the residents.


(+) Joe O?Donahue - Residential
Builders


- Years ago people were against
live/work because it wasn?t providing parking, now people are against live/work
because it is providing parking.


- This project is working for the
future.


- Sue Bierman gave her approval on
this site a few years ago.


- This is a good planning project.

 -- Appeal of a Preliminary Negative Declaration:
? 
Assessor's Block 3785/Lots 20 & 21
situated on the south side of Brannan Street between 5th and 6th Streets within
the South of Market neighborhood.
? 
The
proposed project would construct four new buildings containing a total of 177
live/work units and 177 parking spaces at 673-683 Brannan Street/168-178
Bluxome Street.
? 
The project would
demolish an existing 10,000 square foot warehouse structure.
? 
Each new structure would be 55 feet tall,
and would cover the full lot length and width, from Brannan Street to Bluxome
Street.
? 
The project site is within an
SLI (Service/Light Industrial) zoning district and within the Industrial
Protection Zone adopted by the Planning Commission as an interim zoning
control.

Preliminary Negative Declaration

??????????????? 


(Continued from Regular Meeting of
May 25, 2000)


 


SPEAKER(S):


Sue Hestor:


- There are about 450 units of
live/work in 3 projects.


- Does the commission monitor
occupancy in live/work projects?


- This project is next to the 6th
and Brannan on ramp/off ramp. It is a critical intersection.


- Is there a market need for all
these live/work projects?
? 
It doesn?t
seem to be--not if they are being occupied by dot.com companies.


Gary Moody:


- There are such a massive amount of
live/work projects in the area.


- These live/work projects are not
in compliance with state requirements.


- Things can?t be made up as we go
along.


- He has talked to state officials
and they will look into this and he believes that they will find that San
Francisco is not in Compliance.


- He has talked to HUD, the
inspector general?s office.
? 
These
projects are not in compliance with their guidelines either.


Lloyd Schloegle


- This proposal is in an area which
is zoned for service light industry and contains several active local
businesses.
? 
This is not a residential
area.










- From the security standpoint, it?s
not a good idea to build housing away from residential areas.


- The proposed area is a vacant
lot.
? 
This site would be better used as
a park.


Judy West


- Her project came up previously for
a rear yard variance.


- The issue is that in an industrial
area, people are building live/work because it seems to be the easiest to
build.


- People are not building
traditional housing.


- She thinks that in order to solve
the housing problems that San Francisco has,
?

requirements that are placed on real housing in industrial areas need to
be looked at again.


- No one should build residential on
commercial areas until the requirements on residential are looked at.


- There are places more appropriate
to build live/work.


Joe O?Donahue - Residential Builders


- He believes that 3,000 units of
live/work is far short from the 10,000 units that
? 
was authorized in the South of Market area.


- Live/work will house contractors,
plumbers, architects, etc.


- It would be much cheaper for the
builder to build dot.com to begin with than to convert the live/work to
dot.com.

site used to be a Victorian cottage.
? 
It
has now been rebuilt to a 3-story,
? 
3

light into their home.
? 
IF the proposed
project is approved, this sunlight will be blocked.

until 1995.
? 
Her parents and Mr. Lam
were friends
? 
until Mr. Lam began

questionable.

the neighborhood when later someone else might want to build something similar
in height.

demolition, the law would be abided and the permit would be applied for.

his electrical contractor for many years.

meeting that was held about the buildings being built which are out of
character with the neighborhood.


(-) Rosemary Patten

build and expand their homes.

particular design far exceeds the height of the houses on either side of the
neighborhood.

Alter


- There have been a lot of
hyperbolae.


(+)Tony Pantaleoni


- The estimate of the renovation
from the existing building was done by the contractor.

- Her property is adjacent to the

- There have been two additions to
the proposed property already.


- She will lose privacy both in her
back yard and two of the bay windows that face into this yard.

these rooms to be rented to students.


- Many of the properties around the
neighborhood rent to students which means that each renter might have a car;
therefore, making parking a bigger problem.


(+) Lisa Wong - Project Architect


- She has designed many residential
projects.


- She believes that this is a very
modest addition.


- The two story extension in the back
is legal.
? 
They are only adding another
13 feet past that.


- The project is only two stories
high.


- She tried to address all the
concerns the neighbors had.


(+) David Lee - Co-owns the property
with his father.


- His father lived in the home for many
years.


- The house is too small for another
live-in nurse to take care of his ailing father.


- When he gets married, he will need
the space for his family.

690 - 4TH STREET
, west side between Bluxome and
Townsend Streets, Lots 8 and 9 in Assessor?s Block 3786, Staff-Initiated Discretionary
Review of Building Permit Application No. 9824087, proposing new construction
of a mixed-used live/work and retail building, following demolition of existing
structures on the subject property.
? 
The
subject property is in an Industrial Protection Zone Buffer and a SSO (Service
Secondary Office) District and 65-X Height and Bulk District. The project
proposes demolition of two existing structures on the site and new construction
of a mixed-use live/work and retail building.
?

54 live/work units and approximately 14,600 square feet of ground floor
retail space is proposed.
???? 


Preliminary recommendation: Do not
take Discretionary Review and approve building permit as submitted.


 










SPEAKER(S):


(-) Sue Hestor


- She strongly disputes this last
minute interpretation.


- This project is 85,000 square feet
of live/work in an SSO district.


- This parcel was designated as SSO


- The floor plan is ideally suited
for office use since it has large spaces.


- This is an office site and it
shouldn?t be live/work.


(-)Jake McGoldrick


- If this is an office building,
then it should be approved as an office building.


(-) Gary Moony


- This project is 2 a block from
CalTrain as well as other sources of public transportation and environmental
agencies.


(+) Don Shaw - 


- When the owners came to him they
wanted a building that was mixed used with retail on the ground level and
live/work units above.
? 
They wanted the
building
? 
to fit into the existing
neighborhood --which consists of mostly renovated, industrial buildings built
in the early 20th century.
? 
These
buildings were usually either concrete frame or brick with industrial steel
sash windows.


(+) Salish Mahendra


- He read a letter from the 601 4th
Street Residents Association.


- They have had meetings regarding
this project and they agree with the general concept of the project.


- They had some reservation
regarding the aesthetics of the building.
?

They felt that the developers and the architects had good intentions to
try to make the building match the character of the neighborhood.
? 


- They made some suggestions at the
meetings and the owners have made a revised sketch of the building which meets
the suggestions.


(+) Peter Meyer - Project Sponsor


- He lives one block down the street.


- The owner?s across the street have
made a few suggestions but overall supports the construction. 


- This is a very substantial, nice
project.


 


ACTION:
????????????? 
Take Discretionary Review and approve project with
the following recommendations: 1) take the volunteer donation of $100,000
offered by Jim Reuben on behalf of his client for transit impact fees (to be
paid prior to the issuance of the permit); 2) do as Commissioner Chinchilla
recommended and have a Notice of Special Restriction placed on this project
that would put the world on notice that this has been authorized only as
live/work and not as office; and 3) that any conversion to office use would
require going through the office allocation process.

Review
of Past Week?s Events at the Board of Supervisors & Board of Appeals.


 


Larry Badiner


993 Tennessee Street


- This case was overturned by the
BOA +4-0.
? 
They felt that it was a mixed
neighborhood and that there were a variety of building types, building forms
and building uses.


- He seeks guidance and welcomes any
recommendations from the Commission on how to represent them.


768 El Camino - a Discretionary
Review


- The BOA upheld the Commission?s
decision +5-0.


535 Mission Street


- This item was withdrawn even
before it went to the BOA because the project sponsor upheld the Commission?s
decision.


2601 Mission Street


- The permits which have been
examined at this time are for some base building issues.
? 
Most of them are relatively minor.


- There are no tenant improvements
yet before staff.
? 
However, these
tenants improvements would be making changes to the size of the space or
converting uses.


- Staff will be doing a site visit
in the near future.


Live/Work Status


There are a number of reports
recently on conversion of live/work to offices.
? 
There have been 3 formal complaints from Ms. Sue Hester.
? 
Staff is looking into these.
? 
If they are reported, staff will
investigate.
? 
If they are illegal, or if
they require further permits or further environmental review, staff will pursue
them.


The conditional use abatement Language


This was before the Transportation
Committee and a concern was raised from the Restaurant Association.
? 
I, as Zoning Administrator, responded making
minor recommendations and changes essentially saying that the conditional use
abatement was not intended to extend the grounds for abatement but to clarify
the procedure for abatement.
? 
Also, the
Commission would be focusing on any abatement action on issues that were in
their subject matter jurisdiction only.

new two-unit building in a RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District and a
40-X Height and Bulk District.

take Discretionary Review, approve project.


Prior Action: Public comment was
closed at the February 17, 2000 hearing.
?

The Commission continued the item to allow further discussion between
the project sponsor and neighbors
.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of
May 25, 2000).


 


SPEAKER(S):


(+) John Rohosky - Project Architect


- He would like to request that the
Commission not take DR and approve the project.


- This is not a monster home as it
has been characterized and it is in character with the neighborhood.


- This project does not require a
conditional use permit or a variance.


- There have been many changes from
the original design (e.g. dropped the height to line with the adjacent
buildings, etc.)


- Every effort has been made to
respect Proposition M.


(-) Art Bender lives at 127 Randall
Street


- It is true that there have been
revisions made to the design.
? 
Yet, they
would like more substance revision.


- In his view the house still looks
like a monster home.










(-) Paul Curtis - lives at Fairmaunt
Street


- A 4-story building is out of
character in the entire neighborhood.


- The neighbors also have
endorsements from the Upper Noe Valley Association, The Glen Park Association,
The Noe Valley Democratic Club; District 8 Democratic Club.


(-) Andrea Wurland -


- At 158 Randall Street, there was
proposal for a large building yet it stayed within the character of the
neighborhood.


- This project is clearly deserving
of further review and a redesign.


(-) Anastasia Yovinopalus


- This is a good opportunity for the
Commission to set a precedent.
? 
Will the
Commission decide to make buildings higher without considering the neighbors,
the view, the character of the neighborhood, etc?


(-) Patricia Vaughey


- She believes that this project
could be revised more since there is enough space in the back of the house for
a deck instead of on the top floor.


(-) Paul Travis - Lives at 123
Randall Street


- There are other proposed projects
on the same block.


- If the Commission approves the
project, it will set a precedent and the other projects proposed on this block
will want to build as high or higher.


(-) John Murary - Lives on Chenery
Street


- His neighborhood has been in
existence at least 110 years without 4-story buildings.


(-) Jeff Mounce - Lives on Church
Street


- The neighborhood is not against
the construction, they would just like to reach a compromise -- it needs to be
smaller.


(-) Lory Stazacallis - Lives at 140
Randall Street


- She is not against having this
building built.


- The developer has not lived at the
proposed project, therefore, he has no sensitivity about the character of the
building. 


- She is opposed to the size and
dimensions of this building.


(-) Mr. Axit - lives on Whitney
Street


- He is aware of two buildings that
were built across from this project about 15 years ago.


- Both houses were considerably
small since at that time they were restricted.


(+) John O?Reily -Project Sponsor


- He has many letters in support of
this project.


- He has not ignored the requests of
the neighbors.


(+) Joe Anzer - He owns Real
Management Company of Noe Valley


- He has worked with the neighbors
and with the architect.
? 
They have
attended community meetings and every time there have been changes, the
architect has come back with revised designs.


- San Francisco needs housing and
new homes should be designed for the modern family.


(+) Jim Zack - neighbor


- He became involved in the project
when the neighbors sent him an invitation to attend one of their community
meetings.
? 
He wasn?t very impressed with
the tone the neighbors had against this project.


-This project is 100% code
compliant.
? 
It doesn?t require any
variances or anything out of the ordinary.


- If anyone wants to build and
develop their property they have the right as granted by the planning code.










- There is such a concern about the
developers who come into the neighborhood.
?

Cities need developers since if there were no developers there would be
no housing.

1946 - 21ST AVENUE
, east side between Ortega and
Pacheco Streets, Lot 032 in Assessor?s Block 2114 - Request for Discretionary
Review of BPA No. 20000121665, proposing to add a third story to the existing
two-story house in an RH-1 (House, One-Family) District and a 40-X Height and
Bulk District.
? 


Preliminary Recommendation: Do not
take Discretionary Review and approve the building
? 
permit application as submitted.


 


SPEAKER(S):


(-) Lisa Fung


- A 3rd story addition would change
the character of the neighborhood since most homes are 2 stories.


- The addition of the 3rd story
would block view and light from the adjacent home.


- There are no good neighbor actions
from the project sponsor.


- The 3rd story should be
denied.
? 


- The project goes against the
neighborhood character.


- The planner stated that there were
no opposing neighbors and that is not true.


(-) Shirley Grey


- She is speaking on behalf of her
mother who lives next door to the proposed construction.


- The proposed construction will
block sunlight to her mother?s kitchen and breakfast room.


- Her mother?s stairway will be
right under the construction.
? 
It is not
fair for neighbors to deal with the noise of the construction.


- She agrees to all of the
statements from Ms. Fung.


- These homes are more like condos
since they are very close.


(+) Wilson Ng - Project Architect










- He is representing Mr. and Mrs.
Yap.


- He is proposing an addition of 2
bedrooms and 2 baths.


- The construction will be built in accordance
with all codes.


- He had meetings with planning
Staff and he addressed the 3rd story addition.


- There are other houses in the
neighborhood which have 3rd story additions.


(+) Michael Yap - Project Sponsor


- He and his family (5 total) live
in a 2 bedroom/1 bath home.
? 
They have
lived in this house for 16 years.


- He and is wife wanted to move to
another larger home.
? 
However, due to
the housing shortage, houses are priced higher than what he and his family
could afford, therefore, they decided to make an addition to his home.


- The first choice was to build
below but that was not structurally possible, then there was the 2nd
alternative to build behind the house but this was not feasible either because
it would cast a shadow on the neighbor?s home and that would also take away
from their daughters playing outside or weekend barbecues.
? 
So the only alternative was to build above.


- He talked to their neighbors about
the proposed addition, they seemed indifferent or said no without giving any
reasons.

(-) Celia Hamilton - DR Requestor -
Lives at 345 Post Street


- She was very happy when Kaiser
Permanente Hospital finished their construction on the addition of the
hospital.


- Now there is a proposal for
another construction.


- She and the neighbors agree that
the noise involved in a construction is nerve wracking.


- She would like for construction to
start not before 7:00 a.m. and no construction work on Saturdays.

- She has lived at this location

? 
The construction lasted 2 years and the
workers started at 6:00 am.
? 
After this
construction was completed, Kaiser Permanente Hospital began construction of an
addition.


- Because of the high rent on
apartments, she cannot afford to move.


- She does not object to the
construction, yet she does object of such an early construction start
time.
? 
The project sponsors should be
considered of the neighbors.










(-) Patricia Vaughey


- She has a suggestion: Construction
time from 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. (Which means that they stop working at 6:00
p.m so construction workers can do their clean up and be out by 7:00 p.m.

- When you limit construction time,
the cost goes up.


- He lived at 25 Garden Street many

- Staff has spent many
hours with the project sponsor.
? 
The
conclusion is that the permit application before the department is not
permitted under the provisions of the Planning Code.


- The project sponsor
needs to alter the permit or seek a justifiable variance.

- A letter has been sent

At the same time, a letter has been sent to

-
It is the opinion of the Planning Department that a Conditional Use
Authorization may be required because of physical alterations that resulted in

- The Mayors office
increased the budget slightly.


- The recommendation
from the budget analyst to the board was to reduce: materials, supplies, fringe
benefits, etc. which are normal recommendations.


- The Department
requested a Transcriber/Typist position which the budget analyst wasn?t too
much in agreement with.
? 
This position
is needed to meet the demands and increase in responsibilities resulting from
Proposition G.
? 
Commission minutes are
to be more detailed and they are to be provided in a much quicker turnaround.


-There are a number of
public members who are willing to stand behind the department in terms of
seeking additional funding for the Transit Oriented Studies that are being
done, especially for the Balboa Park area.
?

There is a good chance that there will be support since district
elections are coming up.


 


11.
????? 
Staff report on
whether or not the Commission has authority, under the Discretionary Review
process to impose exactions such as affordable housing and transportation.


 


Gerald Green:


- Currently the
Commission has the ability to require projects to mitigate certain impacts in
the following ways: under the conditional use process, the Commission
implements the inclusionary housing policies; under the affordable housing program,
the Commission is able to provide an exaction from office development which
goes to affordable housing fund, transit impact fee, child care and open space
in certain districts.
? 
Currently, this
is not imposed using the Discretionary Review process. Normally, the Commission
has the responsibility of acknowledging that there is a direct relationship or
nexus between the impact of a project and the condition which is imposed.
? 
The Commission does acknowledge that a
certain project does create additional demands on housing, transit, etc.
?? 
Ms. Boyagen of the City Attorney?s office
will expand on this issue.


Judy Boyagen


- The general principal
under Federal and State law, is to impose a monetary fee or other type of
exaction that requires the showing that there is a connection between the
impact of the project and the conditions
?

imposed to mitigate that impact.


- Under state law that
is actually codified of the government code starting at Section 6600.
? 
It actually sets forth a nexus requirement
and accounting reporting requirements.


- The funds have to be
segregated, accounted for, reported to the people that contributed and a return
of the money if it is not used for the purpose it was collected.










- There is no major
legal difference between a fee and exactions through legislation or through the
Commission?s discretionary powers..
?? 
It
is still the same requirements.
? 
Through
legislation, you have the opportunity to do the study which will demonstrate
the nexus and set the appropriate fee.


- Under state and
federal laws the fee of the impact has to be proportional to the impact.


- It is difficult for
the Commission to do this on a case by case basis.


- The Commission does
have the authority to impose compliance with future legislation (Russ vs. San
Francisco).


- In Conclusion, I [Judy
Boyagen] believe that legislation is preferred but if the Commission complied
with all the legal requirements, it can be done under the Discretionary Review
power.


Gerald Green:


- There have been some
projects where there has been a nexus study.


- There is a nexus study
being prepared for the expansion of the transit impact fees beyond the C-3
districts.
? 
It will be available to the
Commissioners in the near future.


- The Commission does have
a right to put a Aplace holder@ condition on certain projects.
? 
It should be determined before what kind of
projects and at what scale these projects should have conditions.


- Another option would
be for the Commission to develop a policy in which conditions on a general
basis would be imposed from a project where the relationship of the impact
would require it.


- Staff is preparing a
nexus study to allow for the expansion of the transit impact fees beyond the
C-3 Districts which will be availabe in the near future.


- In July, staff will
begin to brief the Commissioners on the appropriate steps to take
? 
to address the interim controls that have
set up the industrial protection zones.


Sue Hestor:


- One of the things that
is missing from this issue is the role of environmental documents.


- Before these fees were
imposed on projects, environmental documents played a key role in determining
the impact on housing and transit.
? 
This
eventually set the basis for the implementation of these fees.


- The Commission has
more responsibility now.
? 
The Commission
has to demand that the EIR?s generate adequate information.


Joe O?Donahue - Residential Builders


- There is a housing
crisis right now on housing and live/work.


- Live/work is functional
zoning


- Privatizing MUNI would
make the department more efficient.


- They proposed to the
Board Of Supervisors on EIRs--that they include socioeconomic impact analyses
as part of the reports.


John Bovis


- There seems to be a
need to expand the authority of the Commission and try to exact some penalty
from projects.
? 
He suggests that the
Commission come up with clear legislation that describes the authority the
Commission would like to have.


- It is a good idea to
write good environmental impact reports, therefore, there is a good basis from
which to proceed. 


Joe Cassidy - Residential Builders


- They have never sued
anybody.


- They do not advocate
or threaten Lawsuits.


 










ACTION:
? 
Continued to July 20, 2000 - for further discussion
which would allow the additional contribution of absent Commissioners and could
ultimately lead to an action by the Commission.
? 
A resolution should be drafted which sets forth the Commissioners
reasons for considering this policy and what the actual policy will be.


This item will be calendared under Director?s Report.
?

(-) Heather Donovan -
1st DR Requestor


- Her neighborhood has
an appearance of a small neighborhood.

the impact on the sunlight coming into the light well.


- The penthouse is
located right in the middle of the building, where the light well is.










- She went to the
PG&E Energy Center to get a light study.
?

This is a study of the sun and shading patterns.
? 
It can show how the sun will shadow for a
particular time of the day during the year. 


- She showed pictures of
the impact the addition would have on sunlight being blocked onto their light well.


(+) Corey Reed - Project
Sponsor


- This is not an
exceptional case.
? 
There is no
significant harm to the neighborhood nor is it out of character to the
neighborhood.


- The issues the
neighbors seem to have is the sunlight being blocked.


- There is no impact on
anyone?s view.


- In respect to the
character of the neighborhood--there are several buildings that are different
in shape, size and look.


- There are a couple of
improvement projects proposed on this street.


- The size of the immediate
neighbor?s light well is quite large.


- The structural
engineer has determined that the design of the addition could not be revised.

Requestor


- She and her husband
didn?t approve of the first design

- Although this is in an
RH-2 District, there are 8 single-family uses.
?

Single- family uses are smaller in scale.

that the 4th story that is proposed is out of scale and out of character to the
neighborhood.


- They would only like
to have the building scaled down since they are not against the addition.


(-) Dennis Kelly
 
- Lives on Geary
Boulevard


- There are no 4 story
buildings in the neighborhood.


- 3 stories seem to fit
into the neighborhood.

do damage to the neighbors and the neighborhood.

yard of the proposed construction.

This
construction will block their light as well.

decision before the Planning Commission was held on 1998.

It currently has a stop work order.

McGrath building his home.

But if you
look at the overall scope and scale, it stands beyond what the neighborhood can
sustain at this point.

- He is representing the
project sponsor.

guidelines, therefore, seeks approval.

it is a single family, 2-stories over garage structure.
