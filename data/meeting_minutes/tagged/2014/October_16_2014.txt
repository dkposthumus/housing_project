Future Meetings/Agendas
.
  
At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.


 


Commissioner Wu:


I would like to ask today that we adjourn the meeting in honor of Ted Goluckson, a long time tenant advocate and the Director of the San Francisco Tenants Union. Sadly, he passed away earlier this week. 


 


Commissioner Antonini
:


Most importantly Go Giants! But I do have another comment; there was an insight from the Chronicle this week, a bunch of articles called City on the Edge.
  
One of the most interesting one’s was Eviction Crisis Reality Check, and
  
basically and briefly the author points out the fact that there’s 372 almost 372,000 units in San Francisco and the
  
number of evictions in a year is approximately one percent for any reason.
  
The question I have for staff and I don’t need the answer today, just for my edification, he talks about the number of evictions by the Rent Board and that the number that was in court and the number that was Ellis. I obviously understand what the Ellis ones were, which were only 216 of the total, but I don't quite understand what the difference is. My assumption is if they are with the Rent Board with fault eviction, where somebody doesn’t pay the rent, the Rent Board says yes, you prove it then you can evict them, and court would be one’s that are challenged or maybe you could give me a better idea what he is talking about in the article, because he lists various numbers. 


 


Commissioner Richards
:


A couple of things, I guess, parlaying off of what Commissioner Antonini said. I think it’s hard to not put a face on those numbers, they may seem small in relation to the overall number, but each one of those evictions has a person behind it and they have a life situation behind it and it's another piece of the City that I think it ends up being a rotor and goes away, and don’t want to discount, even though it seems like an small percent, one percent it is still several thousands of people a year getting displaced. My niece called me up three weeks ago crying because she got evicted. It hits home when you actually see the person, you hear the story, and she's thinking of leaving the City now, so, it hits home and it hurts. The second question I have is on the Commissions process question on interim control legislation that gets referred or at least it gets communicated to, how does this Commission handle that? Do we ever comment on it? I think there was a piece this week on Office Moratorium on 2
nd
 Street on Supervisor Kim. Do we ever comment on controls? 


 


Director Rahaim
:


Commissioners, interim legislation happens in a very quick turn-around, so it does not - - in the way the code reads it, the Board has the ability to propose interim legislation for a period of time, I think it’s typically 18 months max and it can become effective in a very short period of time, something in the order of seven or eight days and therefore;
  
typically and not only, it does not require your review, but typically there is not time to review it, given the nature of the legislation. There have been, as you say, three or four pieces of legislation in the last few months.

Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission


                


BOARD OF SUPERVISORS
:


No Report


BOARD OF APPEALS
:


The Board of Appeals did meet last night and also last week so I wanted to give you a bit of an update. It was the first hearing for Bobbie Wilson, who is a new Commissioner, replacing Commissioner Chris Hwang, who the left the Board earlier this year to pursue other business interests. Last week they also heard 1110 Ashbury, which was a Discretionary Review that you heard, had three hearings on, it was on early this year. At the
  
final of those three hearings, there was no actual action by the Board so the project was approved as a matter of default and I think that was because the Commission had struggled with trying to find the right balance of changes to the project and I think that last week the Board of Appeals also struggled with the project and what changes, if any, would be necessary and they had a split vote of +2 -2, so by default the project was also approved at the Board of Appeals, so that project is finally approved. Last night the Board had on calendar an Appeal of a Notice of Violation of Penalty for the Academy of Art University property at 2295 Taylor. At the hearing the Academy of Art withdrew their appeal on that property. Penalties will begin to accrue. We have discussed with them, that the reason we pursued enforcement on that, is because they not legalize in its current form, and if they can modify that location to something that is approvable under the North Beach Neighborhood Commercial District, then we would treat it as we do with the other enforcement projects and we will hold the penalties and tie those to the status of the EIR. They also had their annual report last night. I will forward a copy of the final version to the Commissioners. I would note that there has been a 30% increase in the number of appeals overall for the Board. The Board hears a great many appeals, so actually the number of appeals from Planning and Building have actually decreased slightly, so is the increase has been accounted by increase in DPW appeals, and largely the appeals of the AT&T boxes in the public right-of-way and that's all. 


HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION
:


Good afternoon, Commissioners, Tim Frye, Department staff,
  
here to share with you very briefly a couple of items from the October 1
st
 and the October 15
th
 Historic Preservation Commission hearings. Just two items to share with you, one, the HPC renewed its two year delegation for staff level approval of certain preservation entitlements. We think the HPC further trusts in the Department because approximately 70 percent of all preservation entitlements now can be approved at the staff level rather than going to a full Commission hearing. That delegation again is for two years and significantly reduces our backlog. The last item I want to mention to you is that the HPC unanimously recommended approval of three Mills Act contracts for this year to the Board of Supervisors. All three contracts are located within the Duboce Park Landmark District. They involve both single-family and multiple-family residences and the maintenance and preservation program those owners have agreed to range anywhere from ordinary maintenance and repairs to restoration, to seismic retrofit. So the Board of Supervisors will hear those items before the end of this year in conjunction with Budget Analyst Office. That concludes my comments unless you have any questions.

With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.
  
When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.
  
Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes. 


 


The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.
  
In response to public comment, the commission is limited to: 


 


(1)
  
responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or


(2)
  
requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or 


(3)
  
directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.
  
(Government Code Section 54954.2(a))
