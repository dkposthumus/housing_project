Rear Yard and Side Yard Variances sought: 
 The project proposes construction of a new third floor and a horizontal addition at the rear of the two-story single-family house and a new second floor above the garage structure within a RH-1(D) (Residential, House, One-Family, Detached) Zoning District and 40-X Height and Bulk District. PLANNING CODE SECTION 134 requires a rear yard depth equivalent to 25 percent of the lot depth. The project requires an approximately 19 foot rear yard at the lot’s greatest depth. As the existing house and garage structure are within the required rear yard, any expansion of these structures would require a rear yard variance.
  
PLANNING CODE SECTION 133 requires two 5-foot side yards for the property. The existing garage structure is constructed into the western required side yard, and the vertical expansion of the garage structure would require a side yard variance, in addition to the rear yard variance referenced above.

Commissioner Antonini:


I'm not sure if this issue falls under the jurisdiction of MTA or the City through Planning or the State of California, but I had it pointed out to me by a visitor from out of town that almost every intersection on Van Ness Avenue has a sign citing a civic code, saying “Panhandling Prohibited” and then underneath every sign is a panhandler. 
 
So, I am not really sure, why it’s never enforced, if we’re going to have a code there, and whether, you know, it’s the City’s job or whether is a State’s job. It said Civic Code, so I would assume it’s a local code, I was just interested in, you know, I don’t need an answer today, but figuring out why there is never any enforcement of a code, it makes us look like we have laws that have no teeth in it. 
 
So, this was pointed out to me by someone from out of San Francisco, and I had to agree with them, because it doesn’t make a lot sense.


 


Commissioner Moore:


I got a number of very positive phone calls yesterday in response to a presentation on preserving our heritage through design guidelines. 
 
People are very excited about the presentation and what it implied.
  
My question to the Director perhaps Tim Frye or anybody is, can we get a briefing on that at some point? 
 
The issue of the design guidelines is something we've discussed for a long time and I like to know how it was approached and is to whether or not there is anything else we can learn from it. 


 


Commissioner Sugaya:


Yes, prompted by an article on Van Ness Avenue and the number of developments that have taken
  

place, such as, I think it’s called The Marlow, which we approved a number of years ago, the Emerald Fund Property, the AAA site, and others that have or will be taking place including the television station sale of that property pending, I don't know how pending it is, but the BRT, could we have a little short memo on both what has been developed along Van Ness in however many years?
  
I know there are ones closer to here, for example, that have gone up, one at Sutter Street, and then maybe a projection if there are things coming into the pipeline, you know, that can be revealed a this point, might be interesting for us to know.


 


Commissioner Antonini:


Yeah. I read that same article, I think it was today’s Chronicle, John King, and I don’t – I do agreed with him, that The Marlow is kind of – is an interesting building, but it doesn't really, isn’t really contextual with 
 
the street. 
 
I don’t agree with him with the towers, which I think, did a good job trying to blend in with the older buildings that are along that street from the 20s and 30s, but it's just a matter of taste, but it is interesting that, you know, I'm very supportive of what Commissioner Sugaya had asked for because I think we need to know more about what's happening with the Bus Rapid Transit, hopefully, eventually light rail and how the street is going to be reconfigured.

Director’s Announcements


                


 


Director Rahaim:


I was actually going to talk a little bit about what happened yesterday at the Preservation Commission in light of Commissioner Moore’s question.
  
It is, the preservation staff has started a process of looking at what we have been calling a local interpretation of the Secretary of Interior’s Standards, basically guidelines in historic areas, to take the Standards to the next level that would be more San Francisco specific. 
 
I've hired a consultant to help us through that process.
  
The Commission yesterday had a hearing on this, the first of what will likely be several hearings, to go over – to get public testimony, public dialogue, but also to hear different approaches that one can take to guidelines and historic districts both for - both for new construction and for renovations of existing historic buildings. 
 
We had the initial workshop, as I said yesterday and we are going to work on a series of public meetings and public discussions about these. 
 
I’m happy to ask the preservation staff to come and have a similar discussion here.
  
I think it makes sense and I think that was the intent anyway, but I will try to get a schedule that we can work to make sure we can have that discussion with you in a timely way.

Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission


 


LAND USE COMMITTEE:
  


·
         
Resolution Calle 24.
  
Sup Campos presented a Resolution that would establish the 24
th
 Street, or Calle Veintecuatro Latino Cultural District, the boundaries of which are 22nd Street to the north, Cesar Chavez Street to the south, Potrero Avenue to the east and Mission Street to the west.  24th Street is thought to be the cultural center for the Latino community in San Francisco, and the primary purpose of the resolution is to acknowledge Latino history in San Francisco and the efforts of the community to create this cultural district partially to stabilize the displacement of Latino businesses and residents.
  
The resolution does not establish a cultural district, but does express support for its establishment.
  
At the hearing, Supervisor Campos presented the resolution stating that the effort is intended to preserve the culture heritage of the area through an inclusive process.  OEWD, the Planning Department as well representatives from San Francisco Architectural Heritage, and San Francisco Latino Historical Society also presented at the hearing.
  
The committee also took public comment from various stakeholders in the community. Sup. Kim expressed the need to keep the residents and business that made the Mission unique in the Mission, and that there needs to be a discussion on how to support diversity, including cultural diversity.
  
Sup Cohen mentioned that she has been approached by her constituents in her district about creating a cultural district in the Bayview and is very interested in the results of this effort; and Sup Wiener expressed the need to focus on existing culture and people; however, we also need to recognize that change, both positive and negative, happens and that we should find a balance between the two. The Land Use committee voted unanimously to move the item to the Full Board.


 


FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:

706 Mission Subdivision Appeals
.
  
On Tuesday, the Board considered two subdivision appeals for the property at 706 Mission, also known as the Mexican Museum.   One subdivision facilitated conveyance of the property from the Redevelopment Agency per earlier agreements.  The second subdivision map delineated the spaces in the pending project.  As you’ll remember, the underlying project was approved through a series of hearings March- July of last year.  The project would rehabilitate the existing 10 story Aaron-son building and construct a new, adjacent 43 story tower.  The project would contain up to 190 DU; retail and museum space. An EIR was prepared for the project, which was certified by the Planning Commission on March 21, 2013. The project was approved and appealed through various venues.  The EIR was appealed. The Board of Supervisors upheld the EIR certification on May 7, 2013. Since the Board action, the appellants have sued the City and are litigating their CEQA claims in Superior Court.  The Historic Preservation Commission approved a Major Permit to Alter on May 15, 2013. The HPC decision was upheld on appeal by the Board of Supervisors on July 23, 2013. The Planning Commission approved a Downtown Project Authorization on May 23, 2013 hearing; and this decision was upheld on appeal to the Board of Appeals on July 31, 2013.  


·
         
For the subdivision appeal, the appellants argued that the project violated the Planning Code and that the EIR was inadequate.  The appellant presented no new information beyond what had already been presented to the BOS on previous appeals.  After a short hearing, the BOS upheld both subdivisions.

INTENTION TO INITIATE DEPARTMENT-SPONSORED PLANNING CODE AMENDMENTS RELATED TO FORMULA RETAIL AND LARGE-SCALE COMMERCIAL
 
USES AND ADOPT A RESOLUTION OF INTENT TO CONSIDER ADOPTION OF AN ORDINANCE AT A LATER HEARING. 
 - Consideration of the Department’s policy recommendations and 
initiation of Planning Code Text Changes
 regarding formula retail and large-scale retail controls. This item was first heard by the Commission on July 25, 2013.  On January 23, 2014 staff presented preliminary citywide analysis and a draft timeline of project deliverables, opportunities for public participation, and Planning Commission hearings to report results. On February 27, 2014, staff presented the draft Phase 1 report with revisions based upon the last hearing and four preliminary issue briefs. On April 24, staff presented the draft final economic study commissioned by the Planning Department focused on analyzing economic and land use impacts of formula retail establishments and controls on San Francisco’s neighborhoods. Pursuant to Planning Code Section 302, the Planning Commission will consider a Resolution of Intention to initiate amendments to the Planning Code. The amendments are intended to amend the definition of formula retail to include businesses that have 20 or more outlets worldwide; expand the applicability of formula retail controls to other types of uses; require Conditional Use Authorization for formula retail establishments in the C-3-G district with facades facing Market Street, between 6th Street and 12
th
 Street; expand the applicability of formula retail controls to create a new administrative review process for the authorization of a new formula retail operator at a parcel that had previously received a Conditional Use Authorization for the same formula retail use type and size, which will include new notification procedures, performance standards, and a process for requiring Conditional Use Authorization when the performance standards are not met or upon request; remove the requirement for Conditional Use authorization when a formula retail establishment changes operator but remains the same size and use category and instead
;
 require the new administrative review; amend the Conditional Use criteria for Large-Scale Retail Uses to require an economic impact study and establish new fees for said study; and adopting findings, including environmental findings, Section 302 findings and findings of consistency with the General Plan and Planning Code Section 101.1.    
          
                  

Preliminary Recommendation: Adopt a Resolution Initiating Planning Code Text Changes to Be Considered for Adoption On or After June 5, 2014.
