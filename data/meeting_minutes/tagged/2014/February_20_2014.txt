Commissioner Antonini:


Thank you, well; this is a week as most weeks where in my opinion there's good news and bad news. Good news is that Google is apparently looking to acquire a building at 283 Alabama where they would put two hundred employees and I think that’s a good start to having more tech companies put more of their employees in San Francisco, rather than having them further down the Peninsula. And along those same
  
lines, a good article in the Chronicle by John King, talking about the four towers under construction at First and Mission and part of this article talks on --
  
that same subject tells how this will be an excellent opportunity for, among others, tech companies to move and create a significant presence here, perhaps headquarters. These are, particularly a couple of them are, iconic kind of buildings and certainly it
  
would
  
be
  
something that it would be appealing,
  
if one were the leader of one of these companies. We see this even today, with companies like Transamerica Life Insurance Company, which does not own the Transamerica Pyramid, I don’t think if they are even in San Francisco, but they use it as their symbol, and it’s very impressive, it's often on TV commercials and other places where you see the pyramid, and it gives the company a real presence. I think wherever possible we should encourage companies to relocate to San Francisco where most of their employees live or a high percentage of them live, they bring with them a lot of revenue for businesses and probably would be a good thing in my opinion. I think there's a good chance that some of these things might happen as tech leaders become a little more mature and want to be in a city and an area where they’re in the middle of everything. That was, in my opinion, very good news. The other thing that's good news is, this is good and bad news, I noticed
  
that there's a move afoot to have high-speed Wi-Fi
  
in a lot of cities, but I haven’t heard anything about it in San Francisco, among the cities that are
  
considering putting in the cable do to this or allowing private companies to do it are Austin, Texas; Provo, Utah; Santa Jose and Mountain View and Sunnyvale
  
and unfortunately on the bad news side, we continue to hear more protests about the – you’re familiar with what is called Google buses, but that category fits buses from almost any companies that move their employees, who live in San Francisco to their campuses outside of the City. Those protesting make it clear they feel that
  
these individuals are responsible for increasing property values and driving rents up, but
  
I'm not sure that's accurate, even if they are, I mean, I think it's a good thing to have a City where your property values are going up where things are worth more and where people want to be. You’d rather not want to be around among the top 10 most dangerous cities in the United States, which was just listed, we're not among those, fortunately. It's little bit alarming, though, to see a shooting
  
right by the Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's the other day and I think we definitely have to do something to make that a safer area, more
  
police presence perhaps, and a whole redesign of the plaza to make it not so frightening down in there. It's certainly is not good for business when people are trying to go shopping and they have to, potentially avoid bullets, that is not a good thing.
  
The other that I have received, is a lot of e-mails and most of the commissioners probably have also received a lot from people who live out in my area, in Western San Francisco, commenting on the Housing Element that, you know, was discussed, I'm not sure they’re exactly on target as far as what's in the Housing Element and what isn’t in the Housing Element, but I do think that they are making some very significant points in their letters. It's frightening to see that the supervisors are considering the legalization of in-laws, and this could apply in [RH-1] neighborhoods, which in the case of our residents out there, they would completely destroy those areas are
  
meant to be family areas, and are not meant to be multiple housing areas. That is not something that is in
  
the Housing Element per say, but Alternative C does speak to increase densification and some other things that sort of leads them to believe
  
that's what's happening. 


Commissioner Moore:


Just to clarify not to contradict anything, but the letters that the Commission has been copied on regarding housing are actually copies addressed to, primarily Ms. Sarah Jones as the Environmental Review Officer, who is in the middle of the EIR updating the Housing Element, so any of the comments are only for her benefit and they are not really yet delivered in any context, which can be discussed, so they just stand there, as we receive, kindly copy, these things, but they're not ready for prime time.


Commissioner Sugaya:


Yes. Just a personal observation, I guess prompted by Commissioner Antonini’s comment about high speed, or whatever the term is, internet connection. Most of those cities are under – are being provided cable services through Google. Google’s first experiments were in the two Kansas Cities 

they are extending it, I think they are in Austin, and already in Provo, and they’re extending it to other communities. I think it's ironic that at the same time, we're thinking we want
  
Google to come here, but we're protesting their buses and using that as a symbol. If I were Google I'd put San Francisco last on any list.


Commissioner Wu:


I just want to let the Commission know that I will be absent next week; I'll be at a Conference on Regional Equity down in LA.
  
I look forward to seeing you after that.

Director Rahaim:


Thank you. Good afternoon Commissioners, just one announcement today, I just wanted to highlight the Public Realm Plan Workshop that we are having for the Haight-Ashbury District. This is a plan that staff has been working on with that community for several months, and there is workshop next Thursday the 27
th
 from 6:00 P.M. to 8:00 P.M., at the Urban School, on Page Street. Again the Haight- Ashbury Public Realm Plan Workshop, next Thursday, the 27
th
, from 6:00 to 8:00 P.M. That concludes my report.

Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission.


 


BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:


No Report


 


BOARD OF APPEALS:


There is a report of the
  
Board of Appeals, they met last night,
  
a couple of items, that might of interest, first was an appeals of a site permit and demolition permit for the property at 340 Fremont Street, this was first approved
  
by the Planning Commission in 2006, it’s on Rincon Hill, and been extended since then five times because in Rincon Hill it is a very tight performance timeline, so it had been extended several times, and the permit was issued and appealed by the occupants of the adjacent high-rise residential building the Metropolitan, and they cited mostly
  
seismic issues and wanted the building to be built to a higher level of seismic safety, than otherwise required
  
and also, it’s my understanding, it will be higher than any other residential high-rise building
  
that has been approved in San Francisco. They want it to be built to a level of safety such as was done for the MoMa, the expansion which is the public building.
  
A couple of reasons cited for the need for the increase of the seismic safety, was one, that it was next to a PG&E substation, although we received no comments from PG&E about any concerns that they have. Second was as part of the mitigation measures for the environmental review that this required a small interpretive display on the ground floor, because this was the location of some Maritime Union halls, so that was part of the mitigation measure and they thought that would attract people, as cultural resource, be similar to SF MOMA, and so that justified increasing the seismic safety of the building. The Board unanimously upheld the permits and denied the appeal. The other item that I think might be of interest is the budget, they adopted their budget last night, they noted that there is a slight increase in the number of appeals, but overall, it’s still bellow historic averages. They also considered, or discussed coming back in the future and looking at their fee structure. You have a higher appeal fee for Planning Commission and Zoning Administrator appeals than for the building permits, so they discussed taking a look at that, and also looking at doing more electronic submittals and the Planning Commission was highlighted for the use technology here, and how we have case reports online, so they are going to do more investigation on that. They will be
  
meeting again, next week, when they consider findings related to their action on 1050
  
Valencia 
 
Street and I will keep you informed on that. 


HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:


Tim Frye is not here, but I have the HPC report. Yesterday they considered the ROSE; they provided review and comments on the draft ROSE, Recreation Open Space Element. They requested edits and proposed preservation policies to align the policy language closer to existing policies in the Housing, Urban Design, Commerce and Industry Elements. The HPC’s comments will be forwarded to the Commission prior to your action on the ROSE, and the second item was 660 Third Street the HPC recommended approval of conversion of PDR to office space for this building, under Planning Code Section 803.9, as you're aware this Code Section does allows greater flexibility in zoning controls provided that the property owner agreed to a long term preservation and maintenance plan for historic properties, so that was adopted and that is all to report.
