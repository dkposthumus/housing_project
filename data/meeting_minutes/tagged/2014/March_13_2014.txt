Commissioner Antonini:


Well they say San Francisco real estate is hot, but I didn’t think it was as hot as the situation was on Fourth Street, unfortunately, this week with the unfortunate fire, but I did want to give great credit to our Fire Department, who was on top of that
  
immediately, and limited the damage to the effected building, it did not spread, except for some windows out and a few other things that are fairly minor
  
to accompanying structures and I think the fact that we did, over the years, since the great earthquake and fire in1906, take a lot of steps with, a large fire department, emergency sources of water that can be drawn upon, certainly showed how effective these steps were in the problem that occurred, on this week.
  
On another item there's been some attention given in the newspapers to, the amount we spend per year on homelessness with no apparently diminishing in the number of homeless identified on the streets. I think it works out to a little bit under $30,000 per individual if you agree with the figure of 6,000 homeless now, according to the Examiner article, half of that is on permanent supportive housing and you know that is money well spent. I would certainly
  
be in favor of spending more
  
to trying to do that, but in connection with that, I think we have to have rules once that was spent and this housing was established to accommodate the people, because
  
it’s not a sum zero game, the reason that we never see a decrease in the number of homeless is because we keep attracting new ones to San Francisco and part of it is,
  
because there aren’t
  
really a lot of
  
rules, and I think if we provide the housing and we mandate that those individuals housed are also
  
treated for any problems they may have, as far as chemical addiction, alcohol problems, mental problems or any other
  
job skills training, that they might need to be able to live their lives independently, and I think when we start putting restrictions on that and then making it,
  
not have people
  
be allowed
  
to be sleeping in public or private spaces without the consent of the private property owner, I think you'll see a lot slower migration of people who are likely to become homeless in San Francisco. I’d like to see us pursue the possibility either through a bond measure or through year-to-year funding, I think the bond measure would be the smarter way to do it to establish as much supportive –- permanent supportive housing as we need along with rules, along with restrictions, I think it would be something the voters would be supportive of if it's balanced.


 


Commissioner Sugaya
:


Just a question to the Director, can you give us an update on what we're going to hear something from staff on the Academy of Art University situation?


 


Director Rahaim:


I’m thinking we're going to have a hearing next month, I believe that’s what we talked about, is that we're trying to get it on calendar for next month, I don't have a specific date, but we are hoping
  
we can make it happen in April. 


 


Commissioner Sugaya:


Secondly, back in 2004 apparently the Board of Supervisors passed some resolution or legislation or something, I’ll read from this: “On May 11
th
, 2004 homeless people in San Francisco scored a victory by convincing the City’s Board of Supervisors to set aside 15 city-owned surplus properties for development into homes for people with extremely low incomes. This new legislation created a process for future surplus properties to be set aside also.”
  
So, if we can get some status report on whatever happened to this program, and whether it’s still around or that kind of thing?


 


Director Rahaim:


I'll be happy to check into that. I don’t know right now, but I will happy to check that.


 


Commissioner Moore: 


Director Rahaim I would appreciate if you'll keep the Commission posted, and I am sure you will be having your ear to the ground, of how the fire in Mission Bay might impact surrounding construction and other implementations, which come in the form of open space, etc., etc. And how you personally, strategically
  
see that being a shift in the overall completion of that plan area. That
  
area is very mature and this is a major setback, and
  
I am wondering - - I would be interested in your position of what your hear and what we can do to help the seamless remedying of the problems, 
 
which are arrising.


 


Director Rahaim:


I haven't had a chance to talk to Tiffany Bohee yet, from the Office of Community Investment and Infrascture, which you know is co-responsible for that area as well, and when I do I'll
  
be happy to report back to you on what the next steps are


 


Commissioner Moore:


That includes how community benefits, etc., will be effected, because some of the benefits only kick-in when the project is complete and that is a very kind of complicated
  
mechanism
  
and I would be interested to hear what we are doing to help.

FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: 


·
         
Zoning Map change for St. Boniface.
  
This property is located in the Tenderloin. Supervisor Kim sponsored the rezoning. The rezoing from RC-4 to C-3-G will enable the existing landmark building to be eligible for transferable development rights. In January of this year both the Historic Preservation Commission and the Planning Commission recommended approval.
  
This week the Full Board recommended approval onFINALreading.


·
         
Planning Code Text Change.
  
This change would allow certain nonconforming structures to be rebuilt.
  
The Planning Commission considered this ordinance most recently on Feb 6, 2014.
  
At that hearing the Commission voted 3-3 to recommend approval.
  
As there were not four affirmative votes, this constituted a failed motion.
  
After the hearing, the 90-day limit for a Commission recommendation expired—this resulted in a defacto recommendation of disapproval.
  
At the Board’s committee hearing last week Supervisor Kim amended the ordinance to specific that the text change only apply to the block and lot with the proposed Apple Store.
 This week the Full Board approved the ordinance with that amendment and supporting findings, on FINAL reading.


 


INTRODUCTIONS:


·
         
Supervisor David Campos, Scott Wiener, Jane Kim, Mark Farrell, John Avalos, Eric Mar
  
introduced a
  
Ordinance requiring the Planning Department to include certain informational questions regarding anti-discriminatory housing policies based on sexual orientation and gender identity on a project sponsor’s application for specified residential and mixed-use projects, requiring an annual report from the Human Rights Commission on the data collected from such applications, and affirming the Planning Department’s California Environmental Quality Act determination.


·
         
Supervisor Campos , 
introduced a Ordinance amending the Planning Code, Mission Alcoholic Beverage Special Use District, to allow mini-golf courses functionally and/or physically integrated with a restaurant use to obtain liquor licenses; and making environmental findings, Planning Code, Section 302 findings, and findings of consistency with the General Plan, and the eight priority policies of Planning Code, Section 101.1.


 


BOARD OF APPEALS:


The Board of Appeals did meet last night, one item that might be of interest would be 340 Fremont, it was a rehearing request. I had reported
  
previously that the site permit
  
had been appealed, the rehearing request was unanimously rejected last night on that item. Also of note, last time, I think, I reported about the project on
  
Valencia -- 1050 Valencia Street, the Board had issued a decision on that rehearing. A cross had been filed by both the permit holder and one of the appellants, so maybe it was a perfect decision, since both parties seem to be angry with the Board’s decision, but that will heard on April 9

.

Request for Variances
 from Planning Code Sections 134, 136 and 140 to vary the required rear yard, permitted obstructions and dwelling unit exposure provisions of the Planning Code.  The project requires an approximately 25-foot deep rear yard for the subject property, which is equal to 25 percent of the lot depth.  A 70-foot wide, two-story portion of the project would occupy the full depth of the required rear yard at the northwest corner of the lot.  A 40-foot wide, six-story portion of the project would occupy the full depth of the rear yard at the northeast corner of the lot, so as not to create a building gap on the blockface along Van Ness Avenue.  The project proposes bays along Filbert Street that exceed the maximum dimensions allowed for bays that project into the public right-of-way.  Six dwelling units are proposed to face onto a noncomplying rear yard; therefore, these units do not meet the dwelling unit exposure requirements of the Planning Code.  The project proposes a six-story, 27-unit mixed-use building within a RC-3 (Residential, Commercial Combined, Medium-Density) Zoning District and 65-A Height and Bulk District.
