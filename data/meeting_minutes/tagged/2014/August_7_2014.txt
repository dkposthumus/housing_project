Commissioner Antonini:


I was interested in seeing an article in Sunday’s Chronicle, Willie Brown's column. It had to do with what seems to be interest by a group to build a facility, he described it as a soccer stadium, but it could be probably used for any use, has apparently has $600,000 toward this construction. It might be something, even though it is in the City of Brisbane, we might want to keep an eye on it, because with the demolition of Candlestick, and a hope to host the Olympics and others events in San Francisco, it would be very difficult to be a the host city without a venue, that could at least have opening ceremonies or some of the larger events within or very close to the City.
  
So, it's something to look at to find out what's happening here, if it’s obviously a great site because it is served by Caltrain, Highway 101, Muni light rail that ends only a short distance from that site and not too far from BART, so it is an excellent site for a lot of uses and one of which, since this site is so big could be a stadium, so certainly worth looking into. 


 


Commissioner Johnson:


Thank you very much,
  
just a quick question, we had a condominium conversion as part of our consent agenda and I just want -- I know we have a ten year moratorium, I think on condo conversions, so
  
I want to request a list of
  
what is remaining
  
on the list of grandfathered conversions that came before the moratorium.

This Ordinance is the Department’s proposal for regulating formula retail, which was heard by the Commission on July 17th.

BOARD OF APPEALS:

HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:


Good afternoon, Commissioners. Tim Frye, Department staff. I have a couple items of interest to share with you from yesterday’s Historic Preservation Commission hearing. The Commission unanimously approved a Certificate of Appropriateness for 201 Buchannan. This is an individually landmarked building, the Nightingale House. The proposed project is modifications to a non-visible addition, non-historic addition at the rear of the property and the construction of a new stair for the ground floor tenant, and then just to remind you the Nightingale House is - has a current Mills Act contract on file with the Department, which as you know, is the single most importance incentive for historic property owners to reinvest and preserve their landmarked properties.
  
The only other item I wanted to share with you is the Commission unanimously approved a Certificate of Appropriateness for 981 Grove Street. This is a contributing building within the Alamo Square Landmark District. The proposal is to construct an addition at the rear of the property and also a vertical addition significantly setback from the public right-of-way. While the Commission did discuss the project at length, there were a couple of members of the public primarily adjacent neighbors that raised concerns about light and air from the proposed construction. It appears that the property owner and the neighbors are at an impasse so a DR likely will be filed and will be reviewed by this property, or by this Commission. The Historic Preservation Commission unanimously approved the project citing that the DR, or the light and air concerns, raised by the members of the public were not under their purview.
  
So if you have any questions, I am happy to answer them at this time, and that concludes my report to you.

REGIONAL GROUNDWATER STORAGE AND RECOVERY PROJECT
 - 
Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report -
 The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) is proposing the San Francisco Groundwater Supply Project, which seeks to increase water supply reliability during dry years and in emergencies, by increasing water storage in the South Westside Groundwater Basin during wet and normal years for subsequent recapture during dry years. The proposed project consists of the construction and operation of 16 new groundwater production wells and water treatment facilities to recover the stored groundwater. Each well facility would include the construction of a groundwater production well and associated fenced enclosure or treatment building, distribution pipelines to connect the well to the existing regional water system or to the local distribution system, and overhead or underground utility connections. Most well facilities would provide disinfection and additional treatment (i.e., pH adjustment, fluoridation, and/or iron/manganese removal). In addition, the proposed project includes upgrades to the Westlake Pump Station to serve three new well facilities (Sites 2, 3, and 4), including new fluoride, chlorine, and ammonia chemical storage tanks, replaced or upgraded chemical metering pumps, a resized transformer, and up to three new booster pumps to deliver the additional water into the Daly City distribution system, all of which would be located within the existing pump station building. The SFPUC is proposing this project in coordination with its partner agencies, which include the cities of Daly City and San Bruno, and the California Water Service Company (Cal Water) in its South San Francisco service area (collectively referred to as Partner Agencies). The project includes operation of groundwater well facilities at 16 different locations in Daly City, Colma, South San Francisco, San Bruno, Millbrae, and in unincorporated San Mateo County. The Partner Agencies currently supply potable water to their retail customers through a combination of groundwater from the South Westside Groundwater Basin and purchase of SFPUC surface water. The project would provide supplemental SFPUC surface water to the Partner Agencies during normal and wet years. During normal and wet years, the Partner Agencies would reduce their groundwater pumping by a comparable amount to increase the amount of groundwater in storage through natural recharge during these periods. During normal and wet years, the volume of groundwater in the South Westside Groundwater Basin would increase due to natural recharge and reduced groundwater pumping by the Partner Agencies. During dry years, the Partner Agencies and the SFPUC would pump the stored groundwater using 16 new well facilities. This new dry-year water supply would be blended with water from the regional water system, and would thereby increase the available water supply to all regional water system customers. An Operating Agreement between the SFPUC and its Partner Agencies would guide overall groundwater management and surface water deliveries associated with the proposed project.
