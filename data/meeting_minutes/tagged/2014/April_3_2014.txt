Commissioner Moore:


I wanted to ask the Commission again, to support that the submittal requirements for all cases, DR, CU, or whatever it is are made consistently and in a timely manner. We have a project today on our calendar and I intentionally did not ask for it to be pulled, where there was no submittal, no new submittals made and the one’s which came in, came by electronic notification, which prompted me to ask Secretary Ionin to please forward a printed copy because the drawings are larger than what a typical desktop printer produces. And rightfully, I think, Mr. Ionin wrote me back and said it would really incur significant costs to not only print these drawings on their own dime, including messengering them, which is even more expensive.
  
Given that we are seven Commissioners, we would all need to receive the package and all would be printed I am, I fully agree with him and his guarding, basically the gatekeeper for us that that is an unreasonable request. When we have an item continued, for example, today we have one where there were last minute revisions and we got a full new set of drawings to compare the old and the new one. In the case that I am addressing we were not sent a package, although I think the architect for the applicant was notified, nor did we have any ability to review it with the eight days notice that we are entitled to see these drawings. And I am asking, the Department and Mr. Ionin, obviously as the gatekeeper caught in the middle, and all of the Commissioners, to really insist and support that applications and submittals create a level playing field for everybody and in this particular case I felt that there was a gross negligent omission of giving us a drawings or even yesterday at the architect’s own costs submitting them to us and that is for me a very important issue. Thank you.


 


Commissioner Antonini:


Thank you, I wanted to comment on an item that we have already passed, it’s an initiation of the elements to eliminate or reduce fees is very refreshing to see. Something before us that actually is reducing fees. I know it’s only an initiation and I think it’s to the Planning Code so I would assume it would only go through the Planning Commission or does it have to go through the Supervisors too?


 


Director Rahaim:


No it is a Code change and the Board has to approve it, but only you can initiate a change, which we’re asking you to do.

Director’s Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


Commissioners, I just wanted to give you a brief update on some personnel changes with some folks that are in the room. I think last week I made mention that Diego Sanchez has moved into a legislative role. I think I neglected to mention AnMarie Rodgers has become the new Senior Policy Advisor for the Department, will be a member of the Senior Management Team, will continue to oversee legislative work, but in a different capacity and Aaron Starr who you’ll hear from shortly is taking over AnMarie’s role as Manager of Legislative Affairs in an acting capacity. So we do have more changes in the Department, so I just wanted to make you aware of those. That concludes my report.

Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission


 


Board of Supervisors Report:


 


LAND USE COMMITTEE:
  


·
         
Supervisor Wiener’s Ordinance: Accessory Dwelling Unit Legislation. 
This Ordinance would allow adding in-law or Accessory Dwelling units in the Castro within the existing building envelope. The Planning Commission heard this item on March 6
th
, and unanimously recommended 
approval with modifications
. 


·
         
The Planning Commission’s modifications included establishing a monitoring process that would allow the Planning Department to inquire the rental rates of these units and would require the Department to report on the affordability of these units within a year. 


·
         
Supervisor Weiner incorporated these amendments into the legislation with a caveat that the information of individual property owners would be secured and this rental rates would only be published in aggregate form. 


·
         
The Planning Commission made additional recommendations which were not adopted by Supervisor. 1) The Commission recommended using the term 
Accessory Dwelling Units
 instead of 
In-Law Units (partially accepted it my placing a also known as in the Code
; 2) to remove the 750 sq. ft. size limit cap for these types of units. Supervisor Kim expressed support for these recommendations, but there was no motion to amend the legislation to incorporate them. 
With that the Committee forwarded this Ordinance to the Board with a recommendation of support
. 


·
         
Supervisor Tang’s Ordinance: Recognizing Small Business Month. 
The Ordinance recognizes May as Small Business Month and amends the San Francisco Planning Code and the San Francisco Building Code to waive various local permit fees for the month of May 2014 for the replacement of awnings and signs on awnings and the installation of pedestrian level lighting.
  


·
         
The Planning Commission heard this Ordinance at last week’s Commission hearing and voted unanimously to recommend approval with modifications.
  


·
         
The modifications included making this fee waiver permanent every May.
  
Supervisor Tang did incorporate the Commission’s recommendations, but split the file at the Land Use hearing so that the fee waiver for this May could move forward without further delay. 
 
The replicated copy of the Ordinance will be heard at a future land use hearing, pending the 10-day hold.
  
The Land Use Committee voted to recommend approval to the Full Board.
  
This item will be heard at next Week’s Board hearing.


 


FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: 


·
         
Supervisor Chiu’s Ordinance: Granting Legal Status to Illegal Units.  
This Ordinance would allow legalization of existing illegal units.  
At that hearing the Commission voted 6-1 to recommend approval. Supervisor Chiu incorporated all Planning Commission recommendation except for one.
  
The recommendation which would allow two units to be legalized in buildings with more than 10 units was not included in the revised ordinance. 


·
         
The Board of Supervisors heard this item as first read on Tuesday. Since the land use committee other supervisors has signed as co-sponsors of the legislation including; Supervisors Weiner, Avalos, Breed, and Mar. 


·
         
There was a long discussion with two suggested amendments by Supervisor Yee. These amendments included: 1) excluding RH-1 (D) zoned parcels from this program; and 2) wish to revisit the Ordinance once 50 units are legalized. Neither of the amendments were passed at the Board. But Supervisor Chiu recommended adding language to have a hearing at the Board one year and two years after the effective date of this Ordinance. This amendments was passed. 


·
         
Supervisor Tang had two concerns: 1) she would like the legalization costs to be passed through to tenants; and 2) to allow merging of these units once legalized through an administrative process. Supervisor Chiu reaffirmed that the program is voluntary and therefore property owners do not have to pursue if the costs seem infeasible. Supervisor Farrell shared the same thoughts but believed there is a value to run this voluntary program. Supervisor Kim expressed concern that there may not enough incentive or enforcement embedded in this program and believed that the City may not receive many applications for this program. Yet she supported giving the opportunity of legalization.  
With that the Board approved this Ordinance 8 to 2 with Supervisor Tang and Yee voting against.


·
         
CEQA Appeal:
  
SFMTA's Commuter Shuttles Policy and Pilot Program. 
The Board of Supervisors heard an appeal of the Planning Department's determination that SFMTA's Commuter Shuttles Policy and Pilot Program was categorically exempt from environmental review.


·
         
The Planning Department determined that the pilot project was exempt under Class 6 which applies to information gathering, data collection, and experimental management activities.  The activities can be part of a program or action that has not yet been adopted or approved.
  
The Department also found that there were no unusual circumstances that would create significant impact from the experimental regulations.


·
         
In the case of the Shuttle Pilot Project, SFMTA proposed to require commuter shuttle providers serving intra-city and regional destinations to apply for permits for shared use of MUNI bus stops.  Permitted shuttles would be subject to certain operational requirements and would carry GPS tracking devices.  SFMTA would evaluate the effectiveness of the program in terms of conflicts and MUNI delays, in an effort to formulate a long-term program for shared use of bus stops.  Permitted shuttles would be subject to a fee of $1 per stop event, intended to cover MTA's cost for the pilot program.


·
         
The appellants contended that the shuttle buses create displacement by causing rents around shuttle stop locations to rise; have air quality, noise, and pedestrian and bicycle safety impacts; could not legally be allowed to use bus zones; and should pay more than $1 per stop to cover their fair share of impacts.


·
         
The Board's hearing lasted 6.5 hours.  Primary topics for Board members were the baseline used for environmental review, the legal issues surrounding the California Vehicle Code, the evidence submitted by the appellants, and the parameters of the Class 6 exemption.  Board members also critiqued certain aspects of the program itself, particularly the $1 per stop fee, and encouraged SFMTA to enforce bus zone requirements and charge for all aspects of shuttle bus activity.  


·
         
Supervisor Farrell made a motion to uphold the Planning Department's determination and deny the appeal.  Supervisor Wiener seconded.  The final vote was 8-2, with Supervisors Campos and Avalos in dissent, and Supervisor Mar absent.


·
         
(The appellant was Richard T. Drury and Christina M. Caro, of Lozeau Drury LLP, representing Sara Shortt, the Harvey Milk Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Democratic Club; Service Employees International Union Local Union 1021; and the San Francisco League of Pissed Off Voters.)

Board of Appeals Report:


None


 


Historic Preservation Commission Report:


Good afternoon Commissioners, Tim Frye Department staff here to share with you a couple of items from yesterday’s Historic Preservation Commission hearing. The HPC unanimously forwarded a recommendation to the Board of Supervisors to reclassify 1007 Market Street, the Contributory Category 3 under Article 11 of the Planning Code. The building was constructed in 1911 and is already a contributor to National Register listed Market Street Theater and Loft District. The Board of Supervisors will take that item up at a future date and we’ll keep you posted on the Board’s final determination on that property. One other item to share with you was the Planning Department presented along with the SPUR/Heritage Task Force a discussion around their report that they published last summer regarding the City’s historic preservation program. There were three main areas of interest or topics of interest among the HPC. One was the initiation of a city wide survey of historic resources. Second, is the design guidelines based on the Secretary of Interior Standards, and third, is updating Preservation Bulletin 16, which you know outlines the Department’s evaluation process for historic resources under CEQA. The Department shared information and on each three of these topics we’re already pursuing or developing information on each of these issues. One in particular, the city wide survey we’ve included scoping what that survey would really look like in our next fiscal year budget and it’s anticipated that it could take anywhere from four to ten years to complete, but we’ll have a much better idea of the overall scope and costs associated with that this fall and winter. And then we concluded the hearing with the Department’s agreement that we will prepare a schedule for both the development of design guidelines and updating Preservation Bulletin 16 by this fall. And we will share that schedule with this Commission as well as the HPC once it is ready. That concludes my comments,
  
unless you have any questions.
