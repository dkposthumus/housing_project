Future Meetings/Agendas

At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.


 


President Wu:


I did want to let the Commission know that I met with Vice-President Fong and Secretary Ionin and we followed-up on the request to talk about the action item list, and so, the action item list is comprised of requests that Commission members may make and Secretary Ionin will send it out on weekly basis, but there were some items that we discussed that had more to do with a larger policy item and I think there will be a number of informational hearings next year, which will help guide that discussion for us. 


 


Commissioner Moore:
 


I ask the Director today, whether or not he or the Department would be prepared to make an update on our parklet study. I see many parklets thrive, I see many parklets being inappropriately used and others not being used at all, what is the overriding policy? How do we monitor their success and what is the Department thinking as parklets grow? Is there a network of parklets or whatever all those questions might be? So the Director, I think, indicated that they would be willing, but I would like to add that to our action list. 


 


Commissioner Richards:


One of the things I wanted to bring up and this has been in the news a lot lately and I actually saw it first-hand on States Street for one of the DRs coming up later, is the subject of fines. Every day it seems I pick up the paper, I see somebody is tangled in a fine situation where they are told they can't do something, they go ahead and they do it. Here is another one, it's like the third or fourth time, I guess this was a tech commune, they were told not to do it and they went back and did it. And I just started asking around some developer friends of mine, and I said, you know, if I don’t put a quarter in the meter I pay $71, if I park in a bus zone it's $371, if I demolish a house in Cole Valley, we fine the person who demolished the house $1,000, if I cut a significant tree down it’s $2,000 and I actually had drinks last night with a prominent real estate attorney from a prominent firm last night, and he said, you know these fines that we charge, they are becoming rounding errors in the development game here. I think it's something we really need to look at. We have this kind of carrot approach and we are sending bad behavior by having some miniscule fines. They are part of the cost of doing business and people are doing things that we don’t want them to do. It is hurting some policy objectives that we have, specifically around cutting trees down and some other things, and I really think that that’s something that perhaps we as a Commission should look at in the future.

141190 Authorizing the Nullification of the Current Four Priority Conservation Areas.
  
A Priority Conservation Area, or PCA, is a locally identified location in urgent need of preservation, designated by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG). The purpose of designating Priority Conservation Areas is to protect key natural lands in the San Francisco Bay Area through purchase or conservation easements with willing property owners.
  
Currently, San Francisco has four PCAs: 1) Sutro Tower, 2) Aquavista/Twin Peaks, 3) Palou/Phelps Open Space, and 4) Bayview Radio Property.
   
Nullification of the current four PCAs will allow the City the opportunity to select new areas for designation and would allow the Planning Department to coordinate with other interested parties when determining the factors that should go into the selection. PCAs may be chosen due to the land’s importance as a natural landscape, agricultural land, regional recreation significance or opportunity for urban greening.
  
Supervisor Cohen asked two clarifying questions at the hearing, and then committee voted to recommend the item to the Full Board.


 




·
         
141096 Planning Code - Height Exemptions for Hospitals. 
This Ordinance would amend the Planning Code to allow exemptions above the height limit for hospital mechanical equipment in hospitals that are legal non-compliant structures with regard to height.
  
This Commission heard this item on November 13 of this year and voted unanimously to recommended approval.
  
With no comment from the Committee or the public, this item was recommended to the Full Board.

141047 Public Hearing - Appeal of Conditional Use Authorization (Rodgers/ Lamorena) - 395-26th Avenue. 
This item was an appeal of a CU to demolish 2 rent-controlled units and produced 6 family-sized units, for a net gain of 15 bedrooms.
  
The Board unanimously rejected the CU and sided with the appellant.
  
Supervisor Mar, whose district the project is in, commented that the City loses over 1000 affordable units every year and that the Board has an obligation to look at the larger policy issues underlying this CU. He also commented that the City has multiple policies supporting existing affordable housing, and that it’s time to act in line with these policies.
  
Supe Breed commented that she was OK demolishing existing housing if it is dilapidated, but not sound existing housing.
  
Supe Kim said that she was one of a number of the members of this Board who have committed to the Tenants Union to ban the demolition of existing housing and therefore she would be voting with the appellant.
  
Supe Tang commented that deciding when new housing produced is more valuable than existing, affordable housing is critical. And that she would like to work with the Planning Department to figure this out.


 


In taking their vote, the Board referenced the following findings from Section 317 to support their action:


1.
       
Whether the project converts rental housing to other forms of tenure or occupancy; 


2.
       
Whether the project removes rental units subject to the Rent Stabilization and Arbitration Ordinance or affordable housing; 


3.
       
Whether the project conserves existing housing to preserve cultural and economic diversity; 


4.
       
Whether the project conserves neighborhood character to preserve neighborhood; 


5.
       
Whether the project protects the relative affordability of existing housing; and


6.
       
Whether the project increases the number of permanently affordable units as governed by Section 415.


 


Our Department will be working with this Commission and the Board to understand the implications of this decision and to evaluate our implementation of Section 317 in the coming weeks.

800 INDIANA STREET
– West side of Indiana Street between 20th and 22nd Streets; Assessor’s Block 4105, Lot 009  - 
Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report
. The proposed project includes demolition of the existing 78,240 gross-square-foot (gsf), steel frame industrial warehouse that is owned by the San Francisco Opera, and used for set building and storage.  The proposed demolition is necessary to construct a five-story, approximately 58-foot-tall, multi-family residential development, composed of three separate buildings, totaling 273,743 gsf of residential uses. The proposed project would include a maximum of 338 residential units, ground-floor residential amenities, and a one-level 11-foot-tall underground parking garage, for a total of approximately 441,183 gsf of development on the project site.
  
The project site is located in the Urban Mixed Use (UMU) Zoning District, and 58-X Height and Bulk District, within the Central Waterfront Subarea of the Eastern Neighborhoods Rezoning and Area Plan. The proposed project also includes two streetscape improvement variants, the Hybrid and Linear Park Streetscape Plans and a third variant that includes a plaza/dog park. The Final EIR concluded that implementation of the 800 Indiana Street project would result in a significant unavoidable environmental impact related to historic resources since the proposed project would involve the demolition of the existing industrial warehouse building, which is individually eligible for listing in the California Register of Historical Resources as noted in the Central Waterfront Historic Resource Survey and the Historic Resource Evaluation Response (HRER) for the project. The project site is located close to, but not within the Dogpatch Landmark District and the eligible Central Waterfront/3rd Street Industrial Historic District. However, construction of the proposed residential development would not impair the integrity of the adjacent districts since the new construction is designed to address the massing and scale of the surrounding context.


Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the Final Environmental Impact Report.


NOTE: The public hearing on the Draft EIR is closed. The public comment period for the Draft EIR ended on 
September 29, 2014
. 
Public comment will be received when the item is called during the hearing. However, comments submitted may not be included in the Final EIR.
