Commissioner Antonini:


A few meetings I’ve had in the last couple of weeks: I met with -- a neighbor -- I attended a neighborhood meeting last night at Mission Station in regards to a project that will be coming before us in the future
  
490 South Van Ness.
  
I met with project sponsor, and sponsor’s architect in regards to a project we are hearing today, 2198 Market last week. I also met with project sponsor in regards to some future buildings that have just been proposed and are undergoing environmental analysis, will be on First Street, or Mission Street, near First or First and Mission. And then finally, I visited the DR requestor for the DR that's filed against 111 Ashbury, which is on our calendar for consideration in the near future. The other item I wanted to ask about, making comments. I realize that we have a ballot issue, but my question is not about a position on the ballot issue, but rather to inform me and inform the public in general about the origin of the existing height limits on the Waterfront. I mean, nobody seems ever bring up in any of these discussions, when was this passed? Who passed it? How were these various heights decided upon? Because it’s not just waterfront, it's property that are inland from the Waterfront. I would assume that almost all of them are Port properties, but I think if we can have some sort of informative presentation about that, I think it would be something that the general public would find very informative too, some kind of history, where those height limits came from.


 


Commissioner Borden
:


I guess the only question I have is, speaking of the Waterfront, the Warrior Stadium.
  
I know they have announced they bought the Salesforce site, I wondered if they filed an application, at all, with the Planning Department or if you all have been in talks with them and their plans? 


 


Director Rahaim:


I was going to address that under my Director’s Report.


 


Commissioner Borden
:


Perfect. 


 


Commissioner Moore:


I see a lot of construction activity in all residential neighborhoods, I consider that to be a very positive sign. Sometimes, I only wonder as to whether or not all of these various activities have filed for the proper permitting.
  
I question that because those builders and developers in the City, who are doing
  
residential remodels, etc., typically post their signs and their permits somewhere on the construction site, but it could be not knowing how it works, but I see many places where that is not quite happening, so it’s hard to trace when you don’t know what is happening, does it have a permit or not.
  
Going to the website is one way, but I am not here to police activities, but I would rather see us, perhaps have a discussion, perhaps together
  
with DBI
  
how, in these very active times, to flag the things, where to ask questions, etc. Because I am observing in my own vicinity something, which definitely requires a variance, despite the very nature of the project. On the other hand, since I don't see the permits posted on the building I have to assume the construction activities, which are going on in the building have also not been vetted properly. So, I am trying to ask as to whether or not it would make sense for the Director of the Department and the Commission to schedule a joint meeting with DBI and talk about this, among other things which we might all have in common.

DEPARTMENT MATTERS

Director’s Announcements


                


Director Rahaim: 


Good afternoon, Commissioners, a couple of announcements today, I just wanted to introduce you all to Mr. Gil Kelly, who is sitting to my left, who's the new Director of Citywide Planning. Gil has been with the Department for about two and a half weeks. Gil come to us with a wealth of experience, most recently from Portland, where he had his own firm. He was Planning Director for Portland for ten years and prior to that was Director in Berkley for nine. Among other things he has been very active with the American Planning Association. As many of you know, I have known Gil for a long time, and
  
frankly we are thrilled to
  
have him
  
with the Department and to be part of our team, so we welcome you. 


 


With respect to the Warriors proposal, as you know, the announcement was a made this week, that the Warriors have purchased – or are in the process of purchasing a good piece of the Salesforce property in Mission Bay to build the arena and to build some office space.
  
The proposal will be to build the arena, an approximately 18,000 seat arena, as well as a certain amount of office space, the exact amount of office is not yet known. That site is, as you recall, a Salesforce site…that site was larger than that site actually had about 2 million square feet of office proposed.
   
It’s not exactly sure how much the Warriors will propose. That site is still governed by the Mission Bay Redevelopment Plan and the zoning for that plan. Therefore, the entitlement process is similar to what normally would happen in Mission Bay. There will likely need to be some changes to the environmental review, we do not know exactly the scope of that yet, we are working with OCIIS which still governs that, the redevelopment successor agency, and under an arrangement that started a year ago a year ago the Planning Department is actually doing the environmental reviews for the Redevelopment - - the former Redevelopment Agency. So we are working with them to scope that out right now and, as well as, we are working with them under contract with them also on the design review needs at OCIIS. The Department will be at the table, both formally and informally with the project.
  
The Commission’s role will not be the normal entitlement role, because it is in the Mission Bay Redevelopment Plan, however, you will formally see the office allocation as you always do
  
in redevelopment areas and of course we'll be happy to bring the
  
project to you, as needed,
  
on an informational basis as the work proceeds.
  
There has been no formal application filed yet, because it is so early in the process. They haven't even scoped fully what the full range of the project is at this point, so when it becomes better defined I'm happy to work with the President to figure out a good time for an informational hearing, to come to you to talk about the scope of the project at this site. You may recall that Salesforce had about 14 acres, this site is smaller than that. Part of the 14 acres were recently, came under an agreement with UCSF, who is going to be building on a portion of that site, along First Street, so this site doesn’t include the entire 14 acres, but does include the portion of site that runs through Third Street to the water or to Terry Francois Boulevard, I should say, so it includes the biggest single piece of the site. With respect to Commissioner Antonini’s comment on the Waterfront, we are working on, with several City Departments on an analysis of the ballot measure, and we are happy to share that when it is complete. It would include review of the kind of history of Waterfront zoning, how it came to be, which properties the Port controls and which parcels the Port does not control; the Port does not control all the properties in the Waterfront. That analysis should be done within the next two or three weeks.


 


Commissioner Moore:


I know this is not scheduled as a discussion item, but I would like to ask that some of the urban design ideas which the Department, relative to the connection with the previous design related to the Salesforce headquarters resolved many of the big connections which we're looking for in very, very ingenious way, I hope that sensitivity, which you all brought to that discussion can be transferred and somehow adapted to how we look at this larger building. 


 


 


 


Director Rahaim:


I appreciate that comment we are very much looking forward to trying to work on this site as a way of making it a more pedestrian friendly and active environment in Mission Bay. 


 


Commissioner Antonini:


It seems to me, on Mission Bay projects in the past, the Commission has approved the design as a matter of the hearing I'm not sure if this is true of the Warrior facility or not. 


 


Director Rahaim:


Commissioners, the way that Mission Bay works is that you approve the design only --I don't understand the history of the site, but you approve design only on office uses, the office component, because of the Prop M allocation.
   
Having said that, the Department will be at the table and we will be happy to come here as often as need be to actually update you and get your comments on the project.
