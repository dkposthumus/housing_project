2479 FRANCISCO STREET
 - Lot 026A in Assessor’s Block 0931 in a RH-3 (Residential, House, Three-Family) Zoning District and 40-X Height and Bulk District.  The project proposes facade alterations and construction of a new third floor, a side horizontal addition at the front entry stairs and a rear horizontal addition to the existing two-story, single-family residence.  Planning Code Section 132 requires an approximately 6-foot front setback at the project.  The existing building has no front setback, so additions to the noncomplying portion at the front of the building would require a front setback variance.  The new 3rd floor is proposed to project 3 feet into the required front setback.  Planning Code Section 134 requires an approximately 16-foot deep rear yard for the subject property, which is equal to 25% of the lot depth.  The existing building has a rear yard of approximately 17 feet.  The project proposes a one-story (14' wide) horizontal addition that would project approximately 13 feet into the required rear yard.
  
Proposed for continuance to Wednesday, April 23, 2014.  The proposed April 23
rd
 hearing date is to allow for a continuance of the variance case to the regular Variance Hearing held by the Zoning Administrator.  The April 23
rd
 hearing will be held at 9:30 AM in City Hall, 1 Dr. Carlton B. Goodlett Place, Room 408.

Commissioner Antonini:


Interesting article in yesterday’s Wall Street Journal, and I just glanced at it briefly, but they posed a question in the article: “What city lost the highest percentage in number of jobs in the last two or three years.” I forget the time period. And they said: “Do you think it’s Detroit, St. Louis…” they named a number of cities that we traditionally think of being economically challenged. And the answer was, by a large percentage, Los Angeles, which lost three percent of their jobs over that period of time. They pointed out most of…it was even worse in the lower income areas of Los Angeles, where sometimes it was 10-12, 15 percent, and the causes, at least in this article, they said, were employment laws, regulation, fees and by contrast the ones that gained the most during that same period of time were Houston and San Antonio, the fourth and seventh largest cities in the United States. And they had, among their jobs created, they had a lot of entry level jobs were created. So, I think, this is instructive for us as we go forward with considerations of laws, well meaning laws, sometimes, to increase the minimum wage and other types of laws that they’re not too precipitous and they have effect of dampening employment particularly in entry level jobs, which everybody’s been talking about keeping. And we often consider them when we approve projects and approve various things to make sure that there are PDR jobs and other kinds of jobs that are entry level. So, I think it’s interesting and I believe that’s yesterday’s Wall Street Journal. Thank you.


 


Commissioner Moore:


I am very happy to see that Supervisor Kim introduces a new legislation on housing balance. Declaring an SUD with specific boundaries, by which affordable housing would be monitored and concurrent with market rate housing coming on-line. I think this is one other very interesting piece of legislation. One responding to the Mayor’s mandate, but also complimenting of what Supervisors Wiener and President Chiu have been doing with innovative approaches looking at housing. There’s an article out there, including a map, I hope that the Director will give us an update, or AnMarie or Mr. Starr, I think this is a very interesting piece and I’d like to get more of the details in pursuing it.


 


Commissioner Antonini:


Yeah, I wasn’t going to comment on that, but in view of Commissioner Moore’s I don’t really think this sounds very good. You know, we just finished doing Eastern Neighborhoods and more than anything, many of the people who commented at that time have said: we don’t want to consider each project a conditional use, we want to have projects that conform should be able to move forward and I don’t see any point in this. All it does is stifle or possibly stifle market rate housing. Does nothing to provide more affordable housing, even less, cause there’d be no fees, and each of these projects has fees connected with it. But I do have a question, and I know we’ll be getting a report later, perhaps whoever is going to give the report could let me know if when we talk about the percentage of affordable housing, is that only inclusionary, 100% affordable, public housing or does it also include rent controlled units, because most of these units would be de facto affordable. Now, technically once somebody leaves they are market rate because the rent can be changed, but I think we have to really look at this and know what the define, the definitions of that – what is the percentage of affordable housing that exists in this particular area. And also, they gave us a figure in the newspaper, anyway, regarding the income levels in this area, and I wonder how recent that figure is. Because there has been a lot of growth particularly some units that are newer condos and rentals, which might tend to make that figure higher than the one that was quoted. So, in terms of staff as we move forward if we could have answers to those because we’re going to have to consider this legislation in the next few weeks, I would assume.


 


Commissioner Wu
:


Commissioner Antonini, thank you for your comments, but I think I want to remind the Commission not to get into a discussion on a topic that’s not been calendared. 


 


Commissioner Antonini:


Sure, most of my things are questions for the main two things I wanted to ask.

Director’s Announcements


                


Director Rahaim:


Thank you, good afternoon Commission, I just want to comment briefly on the article that appeared in this week’s Chronicle regarding the short term rentals and the role of the Planning Department. It was a very prominent article and I think, unfortunately, conflated a couple of independent issues and actions. I wanted to clarify for the Commission and for the public that the Department’s enforcement actions on short term rentals have nothing to do with evictions. Those are private matters between landlords and tenants related to leases. The complaints that the Department has received almost entirely have to do with units that are being held off the market, where in fact, no one is living in the unit on a full-time basis and those units are being held off the market and rented only as short term rentals essentially as a hotel room. The vast majority of complaints that we receive and the vast majority of actions that we take are related to those types of dwelling units. In fact, we did send an article or a letter yesterday in response to that article because I was very concerned that the Department was perceived as contributing to people being evicted from their apartments, and in fact, our actions have nothing to do with evictions. Just wanted to clarify that for the record, thank you.

Board of Appeals Report:


The Board of Appeals last night was a bit of a doozy. Five cases on the Agenda and they were all Planning related. Four of them may be of note for the Planning Commission. First, 1050 Valencia Street was back at the Board of Appeals. Just, very briefly again, a 12 unit building on Valencia Street, five-stories, ground floor retail. The CEQA analysis and determination for that project was appealed to the Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors and also an injunction request was filed in Superior Court that also failed recently. The large project authorization – I’m sorry, skipped one – the building permit was appealed to the Board of Appeals and originally they took the fifth floor off, then they came back later and revised that determination to two setbacks at the fifth floor 10-12 feet on the front and the rear. There were two separate re-hearing requests. One from the project sponsor, one from the Liberty Hill appellants, the Marsh Theater, who was the other appellant did not request a re-hearing and instead, filed a brief opposing the re-hearing requests. After some testimony, the Board did vote unanimously to deny both re-hearing requests, so at least at the Board of Appeals, that project is done. The next item, 480 Potrero Avenue, this is the one where I was slightly getting ahead of myself, this is the one at Potrero and Mariposa, about 70 dwelling units, CEQA was appealed to the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors and Superior Court. This was a appeal of the building permit, the Board of Adjustment, I mean - the Board of Appeals had already heard an appeal of the large project authorization last year, and had denied that appeal, and they also denied the appeal of the building permit on a 4-0 vote. The next project was 340 31
st
 Avenue, the DuPont tennis courts, this is a permit that did not come before the Planning Commission, it is of interest because it is a project the Rec Park Department, specifically with the bathroom on the site, there was a series of determinations and the permit was issued, it was appealed, it was a demolition permit, this was part of the 2008 bond program to upgrade parks and this one specifically was part of their bathroom upgrade program, the permit was to demolish the existing bathroom and construct a new structure that would be ADA compliant. There was some work done to the exterior of the building and the permit was appealed and a new determination was made that based on the current state, after an HRER was done the DuPont tennis courts site was still a historic resource to a non-contiguous district, but the building itself no longer was, the Board of Appeals seemed to favor an outcome leaning more towards rehabilitating the existing building as opposed to demolishing and building a more modern structure and so they continued the item for 90 days. They asked the Rec and Park Department to further analyze that scenario in terms of rehabbing the existing building to meet ADA and continue to work with the community because there was some community preference for a rehabilitation option as well, so there’ll be more to come on that item in the future. And a smaller item, 2529 Post Street, this was a project that got a variance in 2013 for the demolition and rebuild of rear stairs and decks as it required a second means of egress. The variance was approved in 2013, that variance was appealed to the Board of Appeals, that appeal was denied, the building permit was DR’d and it came to this Commission in September 2013, you did not take DR, approved it as proposed. This was an appeal of the building permit and the Board, after some discussion, they denied the appeal on a 4-1 vote. That was, it was a long meeting.
