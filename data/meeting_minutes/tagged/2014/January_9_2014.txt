Commissioner Moore:


For my own reference, I would like to ask, as to, whether or not the revised Commission Rules, which we approved on December 19
th
, would come back to us to see the revisions. If I recall correctly, I think Director Rahaim, you stated, I listened to the replay, that once the Commission adopts the new rules and regulations with references to the Plan Submittal Guidelines, that the Department would return with these revised Submitted Guidelines to the Commission for our approval. So, I just want to ask we stay on track with doing that and wanted in the record.


 


Commissioner Antonini: 


I would agree with Commissioner Moore and would like to kind of see if we could talk a little bit, about some of those issues regarding the calendar that she was discussing, because I have had the same comments from people who, you know, are questioning the policy in regards to taking a fifth Sunday or fifth Thursday off, when we're already off on of the other Thursdays during that same month.
  
But anyway, on some other issues, I thought there was a very interesting article, and well written article by Chuck Nevius
  
in today’s Chronicle,
  
and dealing with a lots things we deal with, basically, the jist of the article was,
  
he talks about, you know, people complaining, but not really doing anything positive about some things that are going on, he brings up some hypocrisy about the fact we have the issue of tech buses,
  
which I think is being dealt in the right manner, and, you know, they’re being a asked to pay something for occupying bus stops, but when you’re thinking about transporting people around it's a lot better to have one bus with
  
two hundred people than two hundred individual cars going through the City, so, if you want to put people in mass transit that makes sense, and then, he also brought up the area -- issue of housing in regards to a project
  
down on Valencia, which was something that had been before us, but it was reversed by a decision at Permit Appeals
  
and ending
  
up having affordable housing units eliminated, because they cut the number of units down, sometimes it’s kind of ironic,
  
that some of the rules that we have, end up working in the wrong direction, but there are a lot of other issues involved. But the one thing, I think we can agree upon is that densification in the City is a good thing and having people living near where they work is an excellent thing. I'm reading a book now called One Summer 1927 by Bill Bryson, and he talks about how the growth of work forces in American cities in the 20’s and he mentions that in the 20’s we had five hundred thousand people working in San Francisco, which is about what we have now, even though we now have a Bay Area with seven million people, instead of one million people, as was the case then. Virtually everyone who worked in San Francisco lived in San Francisco and used public transit to get to their jobs in those days.
  
And certainly, one solution, which will work very well, I’ve mentioned it before is the more companies realize many of their employees live in San Francisco, the vast majority in most cases, and many of these companies locate more of their business functions here makes total sense. We have the transit and we have the ability to move people easily around San Francisco, which doesn’t exist in suburban campuses. Secondly, I just wanted to mention, again, that I am unfortunately, going to be undergoing surgery on the 16
th
 of January and I won't be here that day. And I’ve been advised that I won’t be able to attend on 23
rd
 of January 
 
too, but I will be back for the first meeting, which will be in early February, I think it's the 6
th
.


 


Commissioner Borden:


I participated in a meeting earlier this week, I was there along Jay Nath the Mayor's Chief Innovation Officer,
  
two members of Supervisor Farrell's staff and some of the Mayor’s Office, at the Internet Archive, I don’t people familiar with that,
  
but the
  
archive of the entire internet is in San Francisco, located
  
at 300 Funston at Clement Street and they bought an old Christian Scientist Church and turned into their facility and they are actually cataloging everything that happens at the begin of time, every single web page on the internet, they are scanning books,
  
they’re a
  
free open library for people.
  
What’s really interesting about it, is they were the largest employer for Jobs Now, when this money came out they hired 150 people and they have a lot of people that they hired to work at the facility and one of the challenges that they noticed was actually housing because the people are not highly paid professionals, that people are paid
  
above minimum wage, but definitely not high end salaries, so what they did, is they actually bought a building, housing, across the street and they plan to turn it into nonprofit housing, and they're putting forth this idea, of looking at getting nonprofits together to do
  
nonprofit housing, and basically what it would be is that, they will buy the building outright, because the biggest cost of housing is debt service,
  
and they'll buy the building outright, and then people
  
employed for those nonprofits live in that housing. They loved this idea of an ambitious approach of getting 5% of the housing in the City for nonprofit workers that would be bought and owned by nonprofits. That would have – that they would all share, in being able people to have people live there. It's an interesting concept of what they’re working on, but they really -- they have been talking to the City of Richmond, for doing something similar there as well, but they have really been kind of, great forward thinking in this concept around how you to take the costs of housing and debt services, obviously is the biggest portion of the costs, and something they are looking at.
  
The other thing, that is very powerful, is that they’ve been utilizing the wire that’s underneath the fiber underneath the City and they are actually providing high-speed internet to all the housing projects, the public housing projects in San Francisco. And, we talked a lot about making sure, that we’re better coordinating as we do Central Subway, working with the PUC to put conduits down, so that people could utilize the fiber that already exists, or put their own fiber in, to have a super-fast network, in their mind for free, not for the purpose of propriety use, but for actually for free.
  
Anyway, Brewster Kahle
  
is the gentleman who is kind of putting forth this foundation idea, and his website is Brwester.Kahle.org. It talks at lot about the foundation and this housing notion and reaching out to other nonprofit partners and anybody that wants to hear, but I think it’s a fascinating development, there are obviously a lot of unanswered questions around that sort of housing because it is tied to employment, which is different than the way housing functions typically, but you know, I definitely invite anyone who is interested to connect with Brewster, and I think this can be a really interesting model for a City looking at interesting models.
  
I think it would be great.


 


Commissioner Moore:


I'd like to share a comment to follow-up on Commissioner Borden's very interesting concepts, with an idea that I copied Commissioner Wu on, and that is basically crowd funding for affordable housing of a model
  
which is been experimented with in other cities. I will forward the article to the Commission Secretary for all of you to get a copy including the Director, including perhaps Mr. Kahle, because with these ideas coming together, I think everything is possible. 


 


Commissioner Sugaya: 


I wasn't going to mention this, but many of you may or may not know that former Commissioner Christina Olague’s house had a fire and she lost a lot of her possessions. She fortunately escaped, but one of her best friends did not. There is as onsite – I don’t have the link here, but there is onsite fundraising effort and there’s also one at the El Rio on Mission Street this coming Sunday between 3:00 and I think 8:00 or something like that. So, if you want to express your condolences or perhaps even make a donation I'd encourage you to do so. Thank you.


 


Commissioner Fong:


Jonas, correct me if I am wrong, but as far as the Rules and Regulations we'll likely bring that on the calendar when we have a full quorum on February 6th. 


 


Jonas Ionin, Commission Secretary:


For the rules and regulations?


 


Commissioner Fong:


Right, or sooner than that.


 


Jonas Ionin, Commission Secretary:


The Rules and Regulations have been adopted, I believe what Commissioner Moore was referring to was the update to the Plans Submittal Guidelines.


 


Commissioner Fong:


Got it. Okay. Thank you.


 


Jonas Ionin, Commission Secretary:


So, the Rules and Regulations were formerly adopted on December 19
th
 and they are actually in effect now. 


 


Commissioner Moore:


With the amendments, which the Director basically acknowledged, will be coming back to us. 


 


Commissioner Fong:


I also, just want to clarify, per our rules Officer Elections are to take place January 15
th
 or later or no sooner than January 15
th
.


 


Jonas Ionin, Commission Secretary:


That's correct.
  
Your rules state that election of officers is to take place on or after January 15
th
 or another date you continue the matter to.


 


Commissioner Fong:


Just for our own education, since there will be some absences, myself included on the 23
rd
, with Commissioner Antonini out
  
until the 6
th
,
  
it looks like our next full quorum is February 6
th
, just as a note. 


 


Commissioner Moore:


I just wanted to comment on what you just clarified, that in the absence of Commissioner Antonini for health reasons that we wait until he's back.

Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission


 


LAND USE COMMITTEE:
  


·
         
On Monday, the LU Committee heard the ordinance to transfer child care facility oversight to the newly created Office of Early Care and Education.
  
This ordinance is sponsored by Supervisor Yee.
  
This commission recommended approval of this ordinance on the consent calendar on Nov. 21, 2013.
  
This week the LU Committee recommended approval to the Full Board.




·
         
Also at LU was the Fulton Street Grocery SUD.
  
Supe Breed.
  
This request is associated with a development project located at 555 Fulton Street that would demolish the existing building on the site and construct a new mixed-use project with residential uses and a ground-floor grocery store. The project was originally approved by the Planning Commission in 2010. On October 3, 2013, the Commission approved entitlements to extend the performance period for this project, with minor revisions to the design and program of uses that were previously approved. The SUD was initially adopted in 2008 specifically to enable a mixed-use development containing a grocery store at this site. The SUD expired under its original 5-year sunset date in April of 2013. Therefore, the extension of the SUD term is necessary in order for the project to move forward. At their hearing on October 3, 2013, the Commission recommended extension of the SUD for an additional five years. The Commission also recommended several amendments to the SUD. 3.

At the hearing on Monday,
  
Planning Staff described the commission’s recommendations including: 1) working with staff on language to enable formula retail uses at the site, provided that the future grocery store tenant would provide food that is affordable to the neighborhood 2) increasing the allowable size for commercial uses to increase the flexibility in potential tenants; and 3) increased signage controls.
 Supervisor Breed noted that she is still considering whether formula retail should be permitted at the site, but that she wanted to enable the other facets of the development. She recommended that the Committee accept the Commission’s recommendation for more strict signage controls
[i]
—and these were approved by the Committee.
  
This item will be heard again by the LU committee next week and is expected to be considered by the Board on the following day.
