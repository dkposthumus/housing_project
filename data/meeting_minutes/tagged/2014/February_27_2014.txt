Commissioner Antonini: 


A few items that have come up this week, that I think some are good news,
  
first of which is not a planning issue, but I'm happy to hear that there's now
  
a dress code in Superior Court, it is a step on the right direction, in my opinion. I don’t really understand the objections, because most people kind of know what business attire is and what business casual is, might be some area of confusion, but it certainly is a step towards a more deportment, and
  
better appearance in our public facilities. The other thing, that, along those same lines, I read in the Chronicle, that San Francisco School District has decided to implement discipline after two hundred years, they are giving it a different name,
  
it was an article in the Chronicle yesterday, and they have all these terms that
  
basically are behavioral things that they want to implement in the classroom, which apparently weren't being done before, and it seems like this
  
is a step on the right direction,
  
long overdue, that they are making it a little more complicated than it has to be by giving
  
them a bunch of acronyms, but if you read it carefully, that’s basically what it’s all about and it sounds like
  
that is a good start for them,
  
they may attract a few more families to move their students
  
and to keep their students in public schools, if they continue along those lines. Finally,
  
I have a question, I don’t need an answer today, on proposed State legislation with the Ellis Act, although it’s
  
a State issue it would affect us locally, and the thing that confuses me is, I’m hearing that this is targeted for only one jurisdiction, which seems odd, because if you're passing legislation for the entire State of California it seems odd, that you can target for one area only, which seems, does not
  
make any sense,
  
because these same issues could exist in other parts of the State that might be applicable to this legislation. The other thing, and I haven’t read the legislation, but my understanding is
  
there's no means test,
  
there is no, you know, those who would be tenants who would be subject to this legislation would have to be elderly or disabled and my fear is
  
many people know,
  
if you paint with a broad brush, there are many people who’ve taken advantage of our grant stabilization ordinance and pay very low rents,
  
own pied-a-terres outside of San Francisco and theoretically don't spend over 50 percent of their time there, but it is almost impossible to police this, so I think you really have to differentiate between the people's whose lives
  
will be disrupted and couldn't afford to move or people who are just benefiting from the system, so anyway, I hope that as this legislation moves forward, if it does, these things are taken into consideration, because sometimes, things we do have unintended consequences and I think a lot of our problems with rising rents have a lot to do with people who keep units off of the market, and the more restrictions are passed, the more people are going to keep their property off the market, rather than have to put up with the rules and find other ways to pass them into ownership status by maybe
  
waiting until all the tenant move out and then sell them, so,
  
it's hard to say which way this is going to end up going, but I found that interesting and I'll try to do more research on my own to find out.


 


Commissioner Sugaya:


Yes. Yesterday morning I attended the ribbon cutting and opening of the Center for Youth Wellness out in the Bayview, this was before the Commission a number of years ago, I believe it’s at 3450 Third Street, the Mayor was there, and the Kamala Harris, the State Attorney General was in attendance as well as Supervisor Cohen.
  
It was a well-attended event and I think everyone is happy that it’s opened, as you remember we had a little bit of controversy over it from some neighborhood people, but seems like an excellent facility.


 


Commissioner Moore:


I read an article yesterday, which I’d like to bring to the Commission’s attention, we all know Geary and Post Street particularly in the upper floors of those older buildings, you primarily have art galleries, small jewelry repair and other specialty services, and apparently on 77 Geary, which had at least five or six art galleries all of them have been terminated in order to make room for tech office.
  
I find that very unfortunate, because many of these galleries have been there between 30 and 15 years, so they're part of that network of culture and maintaining arts in the City that is definitely being displaced and threatened by these most.
  
Sometimes these art galleries among others sponsor local artistry exhibits,
  
that's
  
almost the only way, how you can see the larger paintings and sculptures,
  
of what is been done, and I am very concerned that this is just the beginning and I hope that we will find a way to address that more constructively.

Director’s Announcements


                


Director Rahaim:


Thank you. Good afternoon, Commissioners. Just wanted to keep you, you updated on the activities of the Mayor's Office of Housing Task Force, that group had the first meeting, today. President Wu, went to that meeting this week. There was a very large group, probably 75 people in the room. It was a very open ended
    
meeting. There was a very broad discussion, but more specifically the Mayor's staff has asked that – is asked to break down the group into three topic areas for further discussion over the next few months. One will be process improvements at the City department level, obviously including the Planning Department, second will be legislative changes that might be put forward and the third will be financing and revenue considerations. Again with the goal of improving funding for affordable and middle income housing, the goal is that these three subcommittees will meet over the next few months and by midsummer, make recommendations to the Mayor and the Board about potential changes in all three of those categories. So the Department will certainly be involved in at least 2 of those committees and we'll keep you informed as we move forward, that concludes my report.

Review of Past Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission


 


BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:


 


LAND USE COMMITTEE:
  


Zoning Map change for St. Boniface.
  
This property is located in the Tenderloin. Supervisor Kim sponsored the rezoning. The rezoing from RC-4 to C-3-G will enable the existing landmark building to be eligible for transferable development rights. In January of this year both the Historic Preservation Commission and the Planning Commission recommended approval.
  
This week the Land Use Committee made the same recommendation to the Full Board on Monday.Planning Code Text Change.
  
This change would allow certain nonconforming structures to be rebuilt.
  
The Planning Commission considered this ordinance most recently on Feb 6, 2014.
  
At that hearing the Commission voted 3-3 to recommend approval.
  
As there were not four affirmative votes, this constituted a failed motion.
  
After the hearing, the 90-day limit for a Commission recommendation expired—this resulted in a defacto recommendation of disapproval.
  
At the Board’s committee hearing on Monday there were no speakers in opposition and a handful of supporters.
  
Supervisor Kim referenced the commission discussion from February and moved to amend the ordinance to specific that the text change only apply to the block and lot with the proposed Apple Store.
 With that amendments and associated supporting findings, the Committee recommended approval. 


 


FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: 


·
         
Landmark Designation for 660 California Street.
  
This property is commonly known as Old St. Mary’s Rectory.
  
The designation will change from an “unrated” building to a “contributory” building.
  
The HPC recommended making this change on Nov. 20, 2013.
  
This week the Full Board approved the ordinance on first reading.


·
         
Supervisor Wiener’s technical amendments to the Transit Impact Development Fee was approved on first reading. 
On December 12, 2013, this Commission considered and recommended approval of the proposed ordinance. The proposed ordinance clarifies language regarding fee exemptions, by eliminating project-specific references to redevelopment areas.
  
The existing language would expand to cover all projects subject to a development agreement, redevelopment plan, owner participation agreement, interagency cooperation agreement, or similar document. The ordinance also amends the method and timing of calculating the fee to make it consistent with other development impact fees charged by the City.
 Passed on final reading.


·
         
Resolution calling for a Departmental Study of the Waterfront Ballot Initiative.
  
This resolution would refer the initiative measure known as the “Waterfront Height Limit Right to Vote Initiative,” to the Port of San Francisco, Planning Department, City Administrator, Controller, Office of Economic and Workforce Development, Municipal Transportation Agency, and Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development.
  
All of these agencies would then report by March 6
th
 on the measure’s potential impacts, if passed, on the City’s future housing (including affordable housing), infrastructure, transportation, and open space needs, as well as the City's tax base.
  
Timing was a factor as the resolution asked for the report to be completed by March 6. Due to this timing concern, the resolution was sent to the full board for consideration w/o a hearing before a Committee. Items—considered without a committee hearing need a unanimous vote and receive public comment at the Full Board. Also, resolutions w/o a committee hearing need a second vote of the Full Board (instead of the typical single vote for resolutions) and at least 8 votes would be needed at this second hearing to waive the committee hearing.
  
At this week’s hearing, Supervisor Wiener asked to send the Resolution
  
to the Land Use Committee—as the item is land use related and as he is the committee chair and could ensure a timely hearing.
  
The City Attorney stated that the other equally appropriate committee is the Rules Committee.
   
The Chair of this committee could not confirm when the item would be scheduled, but stated that perhaps March 20 could be arranged. Supervisor Wiener, seconded by Supervisor Breed, moved that this Resolution be referred to the Land Use and Economic Development Committee. This motion failed 4-7.
[1]
 Supervisor Campos, seconded by Supervisor Farrell, then moved that this Resolution be referred to the Rules Committee. 
The motion carried by a 8-3 vote
[2]

Request for Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit Application No. 20132.05.01.5870, proposing to construct a new four-story, single-family residence within a RH-3 (Residential, House, Three-Family) Zoning District and 40-X Height and Bulk District.  The project proposes demolition of the existing two-story, single-family residence under Demolition Permit Application No. 2013.05.01.5857.

Request for Variances
, pursuant to Planning Code Sections 132 and 134, from the front setback and rear yard requirements of the Planning Code.  The project proposes to construct a new four-story, single-family residence within a RH-3 (Residential, House, three-Family) Zoning District and 40-X Height and Bulk District. 
 
The required front setback for the project is 1'-3", and the project proposes a front building wall at the front property line for a portion of the lot's width, providing no front setback. Approximately 34 square feet of permeable area (equivalent to 50 percent of the front setback area) is required within the front setback area, and the project proposes approximately 20 square feet of the required front setback to be permeable surface. A 15-foot rear yard depth measured from the rear property line is required, and the project proposes new construction to the rear property line for a portion of the lot's width, providing no rear yard. Thus the project requires variances from the front setback and rear yard requirements.
