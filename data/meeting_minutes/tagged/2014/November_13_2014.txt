Commissioner Moore:


I would like to ask Zoning Administrator Sanchez about the status update on the Academy of Art. 




Scott Sanchez, Zoning Administrator:


Thank you, so we did send a memo to the Commission in early October informing the Commission of the status at that time. Since that time, we continue to make progress with the Academy. We can provide an additional written memo to the Commission, as well, or an update hearing to the Commission, if you would like or if there are other specific questions, but we did have, recently had an enforcement actually related to 2295 Taylor Street, which is one of the properties that the Academy cannot legalize in its current use size and the Board of Appeals had a hearing scheduled for that a couple weeks ago. The Academy withdrew their appeal, and as with this case, as with other cases, they have stated they do not have or contest in any way, the fact that they are in violation, so they are admitting and moving forward that they do need to legalize these properties, so we do again see that as progress. So, that's kind of in a nutshell, but if you – the EIR, we continue to make progress on that. We estimate publishing of the Draft EIR, if, probably in December at this point, at the outside, possibly January, but again, they do have a new legal counsel that they retained several months ago and we have been working and making very good progress with them.


 


Commissioner Moore:


The question I would like to ask, that’s in response not to only the Commission, but also the public having repeatedly stated serious concerns about the Academy as late or as early as in April. I think it was in April you issued a stern drop-dead warning, that as of any day after at the then, agreed upon date of the EIR completion you would be levying fines. Now we are hearing and I am not critical, I am just standing outside the process, just assuming that your administering it, that we are perhaps December, perhaps January, within that vagueness, I think there is somewhat a question about your judgment in April, where you indeed said as of, I think it was November 3
rd
 or something early in the month this will happen. Where does it leave you to relative to making your word and your opinion stern and enforceable?


 


Scott Sanchez, Zoning Administrator:


I think that the sternness of that message back in April, which did it result in a substantial change and attitude on the part of the Academy of Art and subsequent to that, we have made substantial progress on the EIR. The initial deadline that we had was November 1
st
 and I think that probably in retrospect that might have been a little bit ambitious on our part in considering our staffing needs in the other development projects that staff is also working on, this is very much a priority and we have made it as such, but it is, again, quite complex. Staff, we have a continuous dialogue with our staff and with the Academy of Art’s new attorneys and their staff, and the reports that I'm getting back from staff is that we continue to make good progress, that they are working diligently on this and they don't have any concerns at this point about the Academy delaying or seeking to delay the completion of the Draft EIR. 


 


Commissioner Moore:


To round off my questions, this is the last one, this is not a conversation, but a question to you, as the Academy continues to acquire large properties, the last one I heard of is Aaron’s Bakery is on Van Ness between Jackson and Washington I think where the property is located, huge additional holdings are being brought into the portfolio. How can the EIR address a constantly changing set of base conditions?


 


Scott Sanchez, Zoning Administrator:


That's an excellent question. I have confirmed that that property had been acquired by Elisa Stephens. I'm waiting for a report back from Dr. Stevens about what the intended use of that property is. It’s our understanding, initially, that it is not intended for use by the Academy of Art University. Going back several months and years on this, it has never been a violation for them to acquire property. The violation is the change of use without authorization. In this case, after I was made aware of the allocation they had purchased this property I had to go out and do a site visit and they are not operating it in any way and I did get confirmation after the site visit that they had acquired the property, but there is no evidence that they are using it illegally.


 


Commissioner Moore:


Well they’re not in the bakery business, it was a bakery and we all understand how that works. 


 


Jonas Ionin, Commission Secretary:


Commissioners, I think we're beginning to get into a discussion on this topic and I would like to remind you, that it’s not agendized. If we could maybe move on to a different topic and if we so chose, we could agendize this on a later date.


 


Commissioner Richards:


I have a couple things, first one, I guess I should have brought this up last week, we had a couple of States that passed Medical Cannabis, Cannabis Laws the last election cycle: Oregon, Alaska, Guam and District of Columbia, joined Colorado and Washington, but I understand that California is going to have a ballot initiative in 2016 and I know there's really no movements from a State Government point of view to try to regulate this. I'm wondering, with this kind of train coming down the tracks, is there anything going on from our situation from a City point of view. If this passes how we're going to handle it? Do we have any thoughts on where we are going to put these things? If it's going to be sold, where? Would it be in Walgreens or will they be in existing MCDs? Any discussions happening?


 


Director Rahaim:


The short answer Commissioner is no, but because partially it depends in the specifics of the ballot measure, whether, -- it all depends what happens at the State level in terms of the actual legislation that comes forward. I mean if it is 2016 it's two years down the road, we do have some time to kind of -- once there's an official ballot measure we can figure out what might happen if it passes.


 


Commissioner Richards:


The second one, I guess connecting the dots, Sue Hestor who is not here today, got up at the beginning of the meeting two meetings ago and she talked about having a residency requirement for large projects, actually had lunch with Ken Rich from the Mayor's Office and he was talking about this residency requirement. Apparently, there is a study done. I don’t know what study they are referring to; does anybody know what study was done and how many units were sold where people don’t actually live here? They match tax records with the occupancy? Does anybody have any idea what study people are referring to?


Director Rahaim:


I don’t. I am sorry.


 


Commissioner Johnson:


I mean, I, can get back to you. 


 


Commissioner Wu:


We do have to be careful about having a discussion. 


 


Commissioner Richards:


I think it might be an item, a nice item to talk about in the future and I then guess one other quick one to Commissioner Fong, I've been thinking about the whole action item list and the data and all that, and every time I think about it, it keeps getting bigger and bigger, so I promise by next week I'll have something to you on kind of how we want to use it and move it forward and I would still love to participate.


 


Commissioner Johnson:


Thank you, just a couple of quick things so I know President Wu, that we do have some tasks on the Board to get a subcommittee together or otherwise some meeting together to talk about all the requests that various commissioners have made, but I do want to reiterate one that will take a little bit more forethought, I really want to see a joint meeting with SFMTA happen in the first quarter of next year and I know that both Commissions or Boards are very busy, so I would love to see a meeting date by the end of the year, so that we can actually coordinate it and make sure it happens in the first quarter of next year. The second thing is, I thought about this, I saw Commissioner Richard’s request for the continuance of the 27
th
 Street item. I reviewed that before I got here. I was looking at the drawings and I don't think I've mentioned this before, because I hate creating work for people, but it's now been a few times, in my short months here that we've had DR items that have been continued because the drawings were done improperly or were not clear. So, I would like to see, I'm looking at Zoning Administrator, I don’t know if it is the Zoning Administrator, either a memo or some sort of verbal update on what guidance we give people for the creation of documents for residential construction or rehab. If we’re seeing the tip of the iceberg, because we only see when it comes as a DR here, I’ve got to believe that there's more issues under the surface with people sort of providing anything from a sketch on a napkin all the way up to a full blown renderings and everything in between, and I would love to know what guidance we give people on what sort of documents and drawings to give the Department.


 


Scott Sanchez, Zoning Administrator:


Just a quick response to that, so the first step, since these are building permit applications, they must meet these minimum standards required by the Department of Building Inspection for submittal with the building permit application. The second step is under Section 311, there are additional requirements, additional details that must be on the plans in addition to what the Building Code requires. This is something that is implemented by our Current Planning Division and I can follow-up with them and ensure that all the standards of Section 311 are been applied here appropriately and also have some additional discussions with Department of Building Inspection if needed. 


 


 


Commissioner Johnson:


Excellent. I’ll just add that, I know we talked about potentially having a follow-up meeting with the Building Inspection Commission and potentially that can be another agenda item, I echo what you said, I know there are some requirements, but obviously they’re either really broad or people are not following them, because we've seen a number of cases where the documentation provided was very unclear.


 


Commissioner Wu:


In addition, there are guidelines in our rules and regulations too, is that correct, that I know we worked on that quite extensively. 


 


Commissioner Moore:


They were never updated to address the contradiction within the Department verbiage regarding five sets of submittals that would be easy to address if somebody would pick them up, it was submitted prior to the new Commissioners being on. I’d be happy to take the Commission through this again. We can also meet with DBI to discuss it. It's very simple and would help a great deal to create less ambiguity in what it is expected. 


 


Commissioner Antonini:


A few things, I had a meeting recently with one of the project sponsors for 1140 Folsom, which is a PUD that is going to be coming before us next week. Just as a point of information, my office is in the Cow Hollow area and I drive by errands, a bakery, I think, it has been closed four or five years, not that it makes any difference but, it has not been in operation for quite a while and finally to the request by Commissioner Moore for projects to give us update of how many of their residents are full-time residents and how many work in San Francisco and other types of things we've had that voluntarily from a couple of projects that I remember, particularly, I think it was for The Infinity and they did have surprisingly high numbers of all three categories, full-time residents working in San Francisco and the number of units that had children as part of their units. Anyway, I think it would be a good idea to try to have some kind of a policy where we suggest to project sponsors, if possible, consistent with privacy for their buyers of their units, to try to give us some kind of an idea, so we can we can dispel a lot of the talk that goes on about the fact that their all pied-a-terres or other things, so it would be good to have those figures, so if there is a way we can do it without infringing on the privacy of the occupants.

No Report


                






 


BOARD OF APPEALS:


 


Scott Sanchez, Zoning Administrator: 


Board of Appeals did meet last night and no items of particular interest to the Commission to report on, but I would note that Vice-President Arcelia Hurtado has resigned from the Board of Appeals. She has a kind of has a very busy schedule. She is the Assistant General Counsel for the State Agricultural Labor Relations Board. It’s a relatively a new position for her, so that’s been taking up quite some time and I know it’s with great regret that she has resigned from the Board of Appeals. She’s been at the Board for about two and a half years, has been, I think, an excellent commissioner, gives thoughtful and insightful comments on these cases. This will leave a vacancy of one of the Board appointees on the Board of Appeals. They will be down to four members, so in order to overturn it will be three of the four sitting members to overturn any decisions.

Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
