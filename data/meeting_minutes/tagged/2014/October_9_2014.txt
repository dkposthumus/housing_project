Commissioner Antonini:


Go Giants! I had one other thing in addition to that. For the last six weeks or so, I'm almost at the end of it. I have a daily treatment I have to have and it’s down at Oyster Point in South San Francisco. I come from my home in southwestern San Francisco and either return back there or return to my dental office, which is in Cow Hollow. The trip to Cow Hollow is infinitely more difficult, because my treatment time is like 7:30 and then I have hit all the traffic coming north.
  
I was impressed with Oyster Point, because their access is so good. They have four different access routes to get into there, driving, including not only 101, but they also have Old Bayshore off of, from Brisbane. They have a way coming from South San Francisco and then you can go straight and you end up on Hillside and end up in Colma, so, when I have to go back to my home from there it’s really a pretty quick trip. I think that is instructive for us, because we have a lot similarities with developments that are planned in the future, for Hunter’s Point, Candlestick Point, and I think we have to, even though we are transit first, and are emphasizing public transit, we have to realize that most people will be coming by car and we have to improve the auto access to those areas, because businesses won’t locate there unless people can get in and out of there. Particularly, we need to revisit the whole concept of not allowing auto traffic over the bridge conceived to be built over Yosemite Sleuth, and also make sure that we have a decent interchange on 101 and a bunch of other things, as well as on the transit issue of having light rail come directly into that area. We've already spent a lot of money the T-Line and it really should be extended into that area to make it really functional. So, anyway I think that we can learn from those around us, and one of the reasons, maybe why they have so much development on Oyster Point is the fact, that maybe, the development came first and the access second, but I wouldn’t be surprised, if they had pretty good access and it helped to attract a lot of biotech firms to that area because they can get in and out. 


 


Commissioner Richards:


I just want to bring up, I guess, the status on, what I call a running item action list. I think this is my fifth meeting, I believe. I just want to check and get a sense with the other Commissioners and then with staff on three items that I think we talked about before, and when we might be able have those scheduled on the calendar. First one being, the SF Heritage Legacy Businesses presentation, the second one being the Eastern Neighborhood status or implementation/informational, and then the Mayor's Office Housing Directive, the three work streams. I think that was from last meeting.




Commissioner Wu:


I believe that there is a running list that the Commission Secretary has.
  
I think I saw on the advanced that the Heritage item is scheduled.


 


Jonas P. Ionin, Commission Secretary:


Yes, Commissioners we will certainly add these items to the list. The Heritage is already calendared on your Advance Calendar, I believe in November and the Eastern Neighborhood status, staff will be getting in contact with you actually. They may be offering you a walking tour.

Director’s Announcements


                


Director Rahaim:


Good Afternoon Commissioners, I just wanted to bring to your attention and the public’s attention, a slight change in some procedures. You’ve received a memo about this, I think last week, and it has to do with changes to our Preliminary Project Assessment process. If you recall, we instituted this program about three years ago. It is a process, whereby, projects above six units, apply from what is called the Primary Project Assessment or PPA and within 60 days the Department responds with a letter that is essentially a road map for how the project should be approved. The change we are making to this process, at least for a six month period, because the volume of projects, is to allow the project sponsor to submit their environmental application at the same time as the PPA application, and the reason we are doing that is because there is more than a two month or three
  
month wait for staff assignment at this point, and rather than start that
  
five or six month waiting period when the environmental application is submitted, after the PPA, you can simply use the PPA time as part of the waiting period. Also because of the sheer volume of projects coming in, we are asking for a six month period that the staff would have 90 days to respond to the letter as opposed to 60 days. Again, we are experiencing unprecedented volumes.
  
When we started the PPA program three years ago we had about 35 PPA applications that year. This year we will have over 100 and so we are seeing an unprecedented number of large projects come forward. So, the bottom line is that this will allow the period while a project sponsor is waiting for the letter to be used as waiting time in the queue to be assigned a planner, so it will save two to three months off the time for a project and for small projects we think that's significant. Thank you. That concludes my presentation.

140804.
  
Planning Code - Arcades in the Haight Street Neighborhood Commercial District. Sponsors Breed and Wiener.
  
This Ordinance will principally permit amusement game arcades on the first and second floors in the Haight St NCD.
  
This item was before Planning Commission on Sept 18, 2014.  At that hearing staff recommended a modification that would treat Other Entertainment uses with 10 or fewer Mechanical Amusement Devices as Amusement Game Arcades allowing them to be principally permitted.
  
The Commission voted unanimously to recommend approval with Staff’s proposed modifications.
  
At the Land Use hearing the committee incorporated the Planning commissions recommended amendments and voted unanimously to recommend the item to the Full BOS.


 




·
<<Project End>>
<<Project Start>>
         
140806.
  
Health, Building Codes - Ventilation Requirement for Urban Infill Development and Establishing Fees.
  
Sponsor Cohen.
  
The item is related to amendments to the Enhanced Ventilation for Sensitive Use Projects (Article 38 of the Health Code).  This Commission heard this item on September 18, 2014, and voted 7-0 to recommend approval to the Board.  Supervisor Cohen, who is the sponsor of the legislation, introduced an amendment on Monday to the Ordinance that requires DPH, Fire, and DBI staff to review and evaluate possible technologies and policies that may meet the performance standards in the Ordinance.  The Committee voted 3-0 in favor of the Ordinance.  Other significant comments were related to future efforts needed to protect existing residents from air pollution.  
 




FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:


This past Tuesday, two significant events happened in San Francisco.
  
The first was the Giant’s win over the Nationals, advancing them to the National League Championship Series, and the other was the Board of Supervisor’s hearing on Supervisor Chiu’s Short-Term Rental Ordinance.
  
The latter being more germane to my presentation.
  


Short-Term Rentals. 
Commissioners, you may recall that you heard this item on August 7.
  
At that time you recommended approval with 16 amendments to be made to the legislation (deets below)
[1]
, after a 6 hour hearing. The Board’s Land Use Committee held two 7 hour hearings on the ordinance and made multiple amendments. This week the full board took up the matter. Even without public comment, the members of the Board spent close to 3 ½ hours discussing the matter and potential amendments.
  


In brief, here’s a summary of the 12 amendments considered on Tuesday:
  
Sup. Breed offered two amendments—both of which passed.
  
1) Planning would notify complainants within 30 days if no violation was found, enabling an individual complainant to request an administrative hearing if the alleged violation concerns a hosting platform. The Planning Director would then notify the hosting platform of the upcoming administrative hearing. 2) An accelerated avenue for certain non-profits to pursue private right of action when buildings have had an Ellis act evictions. 3) Supervisor Farrell introduced an amendment to include building owners as “interested parties” for private lawsuits. This was incorporated into the ordinance.
  
4) Supervisor Yee proposed that RH-1 and RH-1(d) be excluded from eligibility for STRs.
  
This amendment failed.
  
5) Supervisor Yee then proposed an amendment where RH-1(d) properties would be limited to no more than 90 days’ worth of rental and no more than 50% of the bedrooms.
  
This amendment also failed. 6) Supervisor Wiener offered an amendment that would allow a quick adjustment of the fees and penalties by the Controller’s Office after a PC hearing and would mandate that such a review happen within 6 months of the operative date of the law.
  
This amendment passed. 7) Supervisor Wiener also successfully amended the ordinance to add notification requirements for CC&Rs and neighborhood associations who have asked to be notified. 8) Supervisor Mar offered an amendment to not allow in-law units to offer STRs.
  
This amendment failed. 9) Supervisor Kim offered an amendment that would narrow who may file a lawsuit to nonprofits that have existed for 5 years; had by-laws that the purpose of the nonprofit includes protecting housing; that no damages could be sought by NPs and that nonprofits only be allowed to pursue private right of action for buildings with 3 or more units.
  
This amendment was made to the ordinance.
  
10) Supervisor Avalos offered an amended that all STR (hosted and non) would be limited to no more than 90 days—that amendment failed. 11) Supervisor Campos proposed an amendment to delay implementation until back taxes were paid by all hosting platforms.
  
This amendment failed.
  
12) Supervisor Campos also proposed an amendment that no rentals be allowed in buildings which had seen Ellis Act evictions during the past five years. This amendment was incorporated into the ordinance.
  


 


As this commission is aware, any substantive changes made by the Board that have not yet been considered by this commission will be sent back for another PC hearing.
  
For this reason, the Board split the file allowing the parts of the law that this commission has considered to continue to move forward through the legislative process. The Board approved the Ordinance with the amendments that that you have already considered—this will have a second reading next week. The changes of the ordinance that are substantive will be forwarded to you for a hearing within three months.
   
It appears that the new board file will include Breed’s & Kim’s amendments regarding private right of action for Ellis-evicted buildings and Campos’ prohibition on STR in Ellis evicted buildings.
  
This will be scheduled for a hearing before you later this year.
[2]
  


 


Amending the Definition of a Residential Unit (Avalos).
  
This ordinance would fix an unintentional error and ensure that SRO units would continue to be protected from conversion to student housing.
   
Commissioners you heard this item on 9/18.
  
At that time you recommended approval.
  
This item passed its first reading at the Board this week.
