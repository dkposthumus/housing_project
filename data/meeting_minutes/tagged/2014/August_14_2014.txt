PACIFIC ROD AND GUN CLUB UPLAND SOIL REMEDIAL ACTION PROJECT
 - The project site is located at 520 John Muir Drive in San Francisco
 
-
 Appeal of Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration 
for: The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) proposal to implement the Pacific Rod and Gun Club Upland Soil Remedial Action Plan (the “project”), which would clean up soil contamination at the Pacific Rod and Gun Club (PRGC), located on the southwest side of Lake Merced in San Francisco, California. Soil contamination is the result of the former use of lead shot and clay targets made with asphaltic materials at the skeet and trap shooting ranges. The SFPUC prepared the PRGC Remedial Action Plan (RAP) in response to a Cleanup Order issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, San Francisco Bay Region (RWQCB). The project consists of excavation and appropriate off-site disposal of up to 46,500 cubic yards of soils containing elevated concentrations of lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and backfilling of excavated areas with clean fill material.

Commissioner Moore:


I have a generic question. It pertains to an item which we are continuing, but I would like to have that clarified before it comes back onto the calendar in November. 1804 Mason Street is a property which is not identified in the San Francisco Property Information Map. When you put that address in, nothing comes up.
  
Zero, zero, zero. I happen to know the corner building. It has a restaurant on the corner, which most of us know, because it has been there for probably more than 25 years, however, the property does not give that kind of information, what comes up and the address given to us in today's, now continued matter is, they don't match. My question is how many units are in this building? From what the information says, when I put the arrow on the building, which is in question, it comes up as a single-family unit and for single-family units there needs to be no secondary steps/stairs for fire exiting. So, however, the case states there will be 18 - 10 to 12 people exiting and that might create a whole other definition of what this roof-deck is all about.
  
I would like to ask the Zoning Administrator and the Department to forward more consistent information to us for November, that we can clearly assess what it is.
  
I would also like to know, what the height of the building is, and as to whether or not adding the parapet adds additional height, so there is a whole
  
bunch of questions, and if that could be worked out for proper submittal, for an update for November that will be appreciated. On another positive note,
  
this could be probably very interesting for President Wu,
  
the Singapore
  
Land and Transportation Authority has developed a device by which streets signalization
  
in areas where you have a predominance of elder people, can indeed insert their identification card and the light switches to a slower cycle, so they get a 13 second increase over what normally is too fast, particularly, we have at length talked about the Broadway improvement and the
  
concerns at the corner of Broadway and Stockton street, which is continuously an issue. I've brought in an article, I'll hand to her. It is written in German so I'll be happy to translate; however, the device has a fully understandable English name and it’s called Green Man Plus. I think it is a fabulous idea the rest of the world is acknowledging that this is a great technology and it's a little box where your signal pushing button is and I would love for us to be ahead of the curve and investigate that, so, I will pass that on to President Wu with the offer to translate it for her. 


 


Commissioner Johnson:


Okay. Thank you very much. Just a couple items, I didn’t think that this was going to be public comment or comment for the consent item, because - - you know, I wasn’t going to vote no on that, but just as a general matter, the item on 5421 Geary Boulevard concerned putting in an equipment cabinet on a residential facility next to a commercial facility because the wireless operator never actually did a test on whether or not the roof of the commercial facility could handle the weight of the equipment cabinet, which was about the size of a small car. I think that I spoke to the staff member and I think it was an oversight, but it will be hopefully to know that that’s not something that we’ll have to deal with that in the future, we already have some many wireless facilities to sort of have them not be organized, in my mind doesn’t, does not…the greatest from a planning perspective so it will good have a little bit of confidence that that won’t be the case again.
  
The second thing is, I know
  
that we going to be able to do this when we finally
  
have our new permit tracking system, which supposedly is going to cure all ills and possible some illnesses, like, so it will be great when we have future large projects authorizations, to get either a map or a list, whichever one is easiest to provide, of the surround - - surrounding projects for context. Some of this is because I am a new commissioner, and others of it is because we have so much going on, that it can be hard to remember what is within a quarter of a mile of some of the major projects, that we are beeing asked to consider, so I would like to have that added to staff reports for future large project authorizations. Thank you. 


 


Commissioner Antonini:


Thank you. It's probably my last chance to comment on this particular item as tonight may be the last event in Candlestick Park, but even though I was supportive of Hunter’s Point and Candlestick Point Redevelopment Plans and still are largely in support of those, I think getting rid of of Candlestick is a mistake, because it will leave us for the first time since the 20’s, when Kezar Stadium was built, with no facility that can seat large amounts of people outdoors and puts us at a decided disadvantage for a lot of events that might be held at Candlestick or a future stadium.
  
When we did vote on those of course, it was a proposal to put a new stadium out at Hunters Point which has not been realized.
  
So, I think there are many places that have facilities in hopes of attracting teams, but I don’t think the choice of NFL teams or any other teams, should dictate whether – what the City decides to do with its outdoor facilities, so, that is just my point of view on that situation.
  
On another subject, Prop M, I just did a little research, as to what - what some of the things have been developed since the late 80’s or mid 80’s when Prop M was passed. There are many fees, and there now connected with commercial projects that weren’t present at that time.
  
And just for your generic commercial project in San Francisco, regardless of its location, you have over 35 dollars per square foot for any generic project, and that adds up if you had a project of a million square feet minimum of 35 million dollars in fees, large part of that $25 dollars for square foot is the jobs-housing.
  
But, in addition to that, and I don’t have the research on this yet, but almost every single project is in an area that has extraordinary fees, Transbay fees are huge, there's the Mello-Roos District, Rincon Hill has a lot, Market-Octavia has a lot, almost any of the buildings that are going to be built and all the eastern neighborhoods have a lot. Almost any of these buildings would be subject to a lot more fees which would bring benefits to the city, a lot more, and this doesn’t even take into consideration the property taxes. So that point being made, we have to look at this whole question in regards to today's situation, not the situation that existed 30 years ago when the original annual limit was set, so hopefully we can get some numbers that are more accurate on some of these extraordinary fees. So, I am interested in following up on this discussion in further hearings -- future hearings. 


 


Commissioner Sugaya:


A couple of comments, first, at the short-term rental hearing last week I made a comment that we didn’t have certain kinds of data, including a heat map and other things, which was then immediately produced by staff
  
at the last minute. And hearing that comment that the Chronicle sent me an e-mail the next day or after, maybe two days later, saying that they had done research on the same exact question and sent me a number of graphics that went way beyond any information we had during that hearing, so anybody interested should go to the Chronicle site. I don't have the link in my head, but if you're interested in following what is going on with data, I think the Chronicle has a fairly good handle on what’s going on.
  
Secondly, in terms of Commissioner Antonini's comments, I think that all those fees had to have some kind of nexus study, I think; we just can’t be willy nilly imposing fees without some reason.
  
And also, if you look at Prop M and go over what’s happened through the years, until today, I think, in some ways you can characterize Prop M as a failure. I say that, because one of the reasons Prop M was put forth, was that - it was not just housing, but also transit related to office development and in that regard there was supposed to be, as Commissioner Fong pointed out, a three-legged stool, and if that was the case, then the fact that we're not meeting our housing goals and not meeting our transit demands given Prop M’s attempt to do so, I think, hasn’t worked.
  
And if we’re - anybody is look at Prop M it ought not be from the standpoint of upping the square footages, or even if they do, it has to go beyond that and to figure out what kind of more intensive relationship can be established between the three land uses. That's my last comment, I think, forever.

Director’s Announcements


                


Director Rahaim:


Commissioners, I’d like to suggest that you adjourn the meeting today, in honor of Doug Wright, who passed away last week, you may know that Doug was a member of this Planning Commission in the 80’s. He was the City Architect in that position, was an ex-officio member of the Planning Commission. He was also Deputy Mayor for Transportation under Mayor Agnos, during the time of the Loma Prieta Earthquake, and was one of the early voices for removing the highway from the waterfront and was very much considered one of the early architects of the new Embarcadero.
  
He passed away last week at the age of 68, I believe.
  
As it turns out, I got to know Doug a little bit in my time in Seattle, because of his role in the Embarcadero; he was a consultant to the Transportation Department in Seattle, when Seattle was considering removing a waterfront highway, which it is now doing.
  
So I’d like to suggest you might want to close the meeting in his honor today.

747 HOWARD STREET (AKA MOSCONE CENTER EXPANSION PROJECT)
 - North and South Sides of Howard Street between Third and Fourth Streets; Lot 115 in Assessor’s Block 3723 and
  
Lot 091 in Assessor’s Block 3734 - 
Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report
. The proposed Moscone Center Expansion Project would increase the gross square footage of the Moscone Center convention facility by about 20 percent, from approximately 1.2 million square feet to 1.5 million square feet. New construction would be primarily above grade both north and south of Howard Street in buildings up to approximately 95 feet tall. Additional space would be created by excavating and expanding the existing below-grade exhibition halls that connect the Moscone North and South buildings. The proposed project would also reconfigure the existing below-grade loading facilities and at-grade bus pick-up and drop off facilities on Howard Street, create two pedestrian bridges spanning Howard Street, connecting Moscone North and South at the second level above grade, and include improvements to the Children’s Garden south of Howard Street. The existing convention uses would continue following project completion. Both parcels on which the Moscone Center is located are within the Downtown Commercial Support District and 340-I Height and Bulk District.
