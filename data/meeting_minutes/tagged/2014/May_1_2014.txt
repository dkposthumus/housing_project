Commissioner Fong:


Thank you, just wanted to announce that I had the opportunity to moderate a 

panel at the APA American Planning Association in Atlanta, Georgia, last week. The panel was focused primarily about protecting neighborhood commercial districts with an overlay of formula retail and what is happening here in San Francisco. We had four panelists, varying from different points of view and it was very well-received. Lots of very interesting questions, some challenging questions, but I think it was good for us to have that discussion. 


 


Commissioner Antonini: 


Thank you. I have a few items. The first is I need to get an opinion from staff. I don't need the answer today, but there was an editorial in one of the papers yesterday. I think it was the Examiner and the writer stated the opinion that: if a project was voter-approved that the project then did not need environmental clearance and did not have to contribute to a lot of the exactions and fees that most projects would, and I'm not sure if it was accurate about that, but that
  
is a very important point that the public should be aware of, because there is a possibility that some projects in the future might require voter-approval pending some electoral matters and if this is the case, that is an important thing to know about. So I will take my answer in the future, if staff could just look into that and let me know if he was right about that. The second item, also from the newspapers, former Mayor Willie Brown, I think he was right on target in his column on Sunday.
  
He talked a little about the possibility of the City trying to build some large facility, large enough to hold capacities of 60,000 to 80,000 with the possibility of the Raiders coming. I don't know how realistic that is, but you know, I think that from history, we realize that if you build it they will come. Oakland is a case in point. When Oakland built the Alameda County Coliseum in 1966 they only had the Raiders and because it was there, they were able to attract the Athletics from Kansas City, and the Warriors from San Francisco and for years we’ve not had an arena, and we’ve lost, not only lost the Warriors, but concerts for the lack of a facility. So before we rush to demolish Candlestick and not put a replacement in, I think we have to take a close look at what the possibilities are and certainly seems to be a lot of interest for Paul McCartney's concert at Candlestick and I think there might be a market, for not just football, for the kind of facility that holds 60,000 plus people for the larger concerts, so, certainly food for thought. The final thing is the report in the paper today that the population estimate by the State, San Francisco now has 636,000, so we had a nice growth last year in numbers and our population grew in excess to what would feel would be the case with new units built, but we still built over 2,000 new units, I think, and I'm not sure what number that they quoted, but the bad part about that is that only a small percentage were single-family homes – I forget the numbers from today’s Chronicle, but it may have been as few as 30 of the units built were single-family homes and it's a problem with our present situation we have to find sites in areas to build the kind of housing that families often want. Just out of curiosity, that was an interesting article in today's paper.


 


Commissioner Sugaya
:


I attended the Annual California Preservation Foundation meeting last week. It was held in Asilomar. So it was kind of like going to camp. We had -- I attended one session that had to do with the JCHESS Program in Japantown and it was presented by the Department, led by Steve Wertheim and Shelley Caltagirone was there and also new person Jonathan Lammers and one person from Japantown. It was an interesting session and so I think, I believe very well-attended. So, congratulations to the Department.
  
There was one other session, this one was off-topic, but in the Delta area is a move on to declare it a natural heritage area.
  
The legislation is being carried by Dianne Feinstein and Boxer and I forget the representative from that area, but there are bills pending in the House and the Senate. This is a part of the Delta that has seen a lot of industrial innovations when the Delta was being dredged and the levies were being built, all through ethnic communities, such as Japanese Americans, Chinese Americans, Filipinos who worked on the farms and also built towns and schools and language facilities. I look forward to seeing that materialize. Thank you.


 


Jonas Ionin, Commission Secretary
:


Commissioners, if you notice there is someone shadowing me here I’d like to introduce you to Christine LaMorena, she has accepted my offer to join me in the Office of Commission Affairs as the Manager and will be my primary backup if I am not available to attend these hearings, so she will be shadowing for the next several weeks.

LAND USE COMMITTEE:


 




·
         
131205: Planning Code Amendments Related to Production, Distribution, and Repair Uses. 
This would entail a series of amendments designed to promote the creation of more space for PDR businesses, make existing PDR spaces function better, make it easier for PDR uses to be approved, make PDR controls more comprehendible. This Commission heard this Ordinance on March 13, 2014 and voted unanimously to recommend that Board of Supervisors approve the proposed Ordinance with modifications.
  
The legislation was re-introduced on April 15, 2014 to incorporate the modifications proposed by this Commission. There were several public comments in support of the legislation as is, and a few in support of the legislation but who wanted to see further modifications made to cap the amount of office in Small Enterprise Workspaces. Sup. Campos announced that he was planning on introducing such a cap when the legislation reaches the Board. Sup. Wiener noted that all legislation is a compromise, and expressed dismay that certain parties were still advocating for changes even after compromises had been made to win their support for the legislation. Overall, all three Committee members and Sup. Campos spoke favorably about the legislation. 
The Land Use Committee voted to send the Ordinance to Full Board with Positive Recommendation.
