Commissioner Antonini:


A couple of items, one was an article that was forwarded by Commissioner Sugaya is called “Behind the Corridor” it's thought provoking, and I think
  
it's part of the public record;
  
the second item that I wanted to comment on it, is from the New York Times and it is entitled “Urban Renewal No Bulldozer,” and it is very worth reading, it speaks as an outsider looking at the situation in San Francisco, and it begins very
  
positively saying, what we are doing is renovating a lot places rather than tearing them down and building something new, and it talks about all the successes that have come in the last few years, but unfortunately it then says, part of the reason for this, is our process is so involved and makes it so difficult to build anything new, and in many cases is, they did not
  
mention renovate anything old,
  
the only choice is to try to maintain what's there and some of the assertions, I think, are not necessarily true, but they do feel we’re the NIMBY capital of America, I’m not sure if that is accurate, but they make a few statements to that, but the important thing is the conclusion that's drawn and that is that any problem we have with affordability being either commercial or residential is a result of not -- being -- caused for what we've built or by what we restored, but rather, what is not being built or what is left in disrepair and I think that – I agree with those thoughts, that are
  
found in this article, but it's certainly a good article to read.


 


Commissioner Moore:


I have a question for the City Attorney and for Commission Secretary, Jonas Ionin. A few weeks ago, I think it was last time we met, we had a motion in front us regarding 1433 Bush Street and the wording of the motion was void of some specifics, aside from the quantitative square footages, and also did not have the idea that the applicant, was, in a few hours of standing in front of us have agreed to have on-site approvals, when a motion is, in that sense, inaccurate, does not reflect what we are approving, how do we know that that's properly amended and incorporated?


 


Jonas Ionin, Commission Secretary:


1433 Bush, at least as far as my notes go, the action that, or the motion that was made was Approved with Conditions as Amended for staff to continue working with the sponsor, with regard to concerns raised by the Commissioners at the hearing, and there were a variety of independent concerns that were raised by Commissioners that the sponsor had agreed to look into it, if my recollection is correct.


 


Commissioner Moore:


Except that a few hours before the Commissioners, before the applicant stood in front of us, he wrote an e-mail to us, that he was considering on-site affordable, which was not part of the motion nor was it read or restated by us approving the project, we basically all said it's great, but we did not repeat it, while the motion was being made, and I'm concerned that, that might fall between the cracks. 


 


Jonas Ionin, Commissioner Secretary:


If it’s not part of the motion Commissioners, it’s not part...


 


Commissioner Wu:


My question is whether staff read it into the record. Which, I believe they did.


 


Commissioner Moore:


I do not recall that.


 


Jonas Ionin, Commissioner Secretary:


I don’t recall that either, because then the approval would have been as Amended with what staff read into the record, I could look into further for this particular case, but if it’s not a part of the official record, either in the draft motion or read into the record by staff or the Commission, then it’s not something that gets officially adopted into the action or the final motion. If the sponsor, obviously, voluntarily wants to provide that…




Commissioner Moore:


Neighborhood concerns had strongly asked that he does, we obviously were so enthusiastic in hearing that, that I think, in the idea of enthusiasm, we forgot to restate it and that can sometimes happen, you might want to listen to it, I just recall and said, how do we know that we are catching this?


 


Jonas Ionin, Commission Secretary:


Right, I think it's the responsibility of staff and the commissioners and myself at the hearing, if it’s – see I wasn't even aware – I wasn’t even a party of the e-mail that was sent prior to the hearing, unless it gets mentioned as part of the actual motion then it doesn’t adopted into the final motion. 


 


Commissioner Moore:


 
I will forward the e-mail to you, which came in a few hours ago, and perhaps check out what happened.




Jonas Ionin, Commission Secretary:


I can certainly follow-up on that.
  


 


Commissioner Sugaya:


I seem to remember that, staff did make a presentation that included that statement. That the project sponsor had voluntarily included on-site, and I don’t remember if there was a Commission discussion about it, but I think staff did mention it, as I recall.

HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:


Good afternoon Commissioners, Tim Frye, Department staff, here to share with you a couple items from yesterday’s Historical Preservation Commission hearing. Before the full Commission met the Architectural Review Committee provided some design guidance for the LightRail art installation. You may be familiar with the proposed installation. It’s an illuminated art installation, suspended from the existing Muni lines and attached to the Path of Gold light standards running from the Embarcadero to Van Ness Avenue. The ARC, overall was supportive of the project, they did have a few issues, that they’d like the project sponsor to resolve before the full hearing, and they primarily were associated with the design of the utility boxes that would be attached to the Path of Gold light fixtures and they're overall location. The HPC will take up the request for the Certificate of the Appropriateness at its June 18
th
 hearing. The full commission then convened and provided Reviewed & Comment on the EIR for 1527 Pine Street, the Commission had very few comments, and I believe that item will be before you at a future date, if you have any questions about their comments, I am happy to forward those to you via email.
  
And then finally, the Commission reviewed and approved a request for a Certificate of Appropriateness for Alamo Square renovations. The renovations included: improvements to the landscaping along the entries, some ADA upgrades and a new restroom structure located adjacent to the playground. Overall, the Commission was supportive of the project and the improvements. There were members of the public that came out both in support of the project, but also some members raising concern about the landscape treatment and the necessity for an additional restroom structure. At the end of the hearing the Commission voted unanimously in support of the project, and the project had been previously reviewed by the Architectural Review Committee and all comments
  
by the ARC were incorporated into the design based on the final approval.
  
That concludes my comments.
  
Oh!, I am sorry, one other thing I wanted to mention to you, the HPC continues to have a discussion about preservation incentives and how they affect historic buildings in areas zoned for
  
PDR. So the Commission has convened an informational presentation by Department staff at its next hearing on June 18
th
, I believe, you'll have similar presentation on June 12
th 
but I want to make aware, they continue to raise some of the same concerns, that this Commission does, so we'll keep you posted on their comments after the June 18
th
  
hearing. That concludes my remarks. Unless you have questions, thanks.

MOSCONE CENTER EXPANSION PROJECT
 - North and South Sides of Howard Street between Third and Fourth Streets; Lot 115 in Assessor’s Block 3723 and
  
Lot 091 in Assessor’s Block 3734 - 
Public Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Report
. The proposed Moscone Center Expansion Project would increase the gross square footage of the Moscone Center convention facility by about 20 percent, from approximately 1.2 million square feet to 1.5 million square feet. New construction would be primarily above grade both north and south of Howard Street in buildings up to approximately 95 feet tall. Additional space would be created by excavating and expanding the existing below-grade exhibition halls that connect the Moscone North and South buildings. The proposed project would also reconfigure the existing below-grade loading facilities and at-grade bus pick-up and drop off facilities on Howard Street, create two pedestrian bridges spanning Howard Street, connecting Moscone North and South at the second level above grade, and include improvements to the Children’s Garden south of Howard Street. The existing convention uses would continue following project completion. Both parcels on which the Moscone Center is located are within the Downtown Commercial Support District and a 340-I Height and Bulk District.

The project proposes to, within Zone 1 of the SUD, construct up to 1,679 new residential units, provide up to 46,700 square feet of new commercial and retail services, provide new open spaces, and new infrastructure within the development site to be built in a phases. New buildings on the site would range in height from 57 feet to 86 feet. Neighborhood-serving retail would be concentrated near the extension of Leland Avenue and close to Bayshore, along which the T-Third rail line runs. A new grocery store, new streets, infrastructure and other amenities (e.g. sustainable features, pedestrian improvements.) would also be provided on the Project Site. Infrastructure improvements would include the installation of sustainable features, such storm water management. In addition to these new parks, the Project would provide significant additional open space in the form of private or semi-private open space areas such as outdoor courtyards, roof decks, and balconies.
