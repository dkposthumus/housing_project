Commissioner Moore:


I'm sorry to hear about Commissioner Antonini’s re-occurrence of whatever.
  
Can we send him another card? 


 


Jonas Ionin, Commission Secretary


We certainly can send him another card. Although just to clarify, it has nothing to do with the original procedure.




Commissioner Moore:


It's just a kind gesture, because I talked to him the other day, he called me and sounded great, he was just getting back to the old routine, and so I did not know the other thing, it's
  
always nice to get a
  
card when you’re down.


 


Commissioner Wu:


I wanted to bring up that the Department has submitted their response to the Mayor’s Executive Directive on Housing, so maybe at a later date when the Director is here, we can talk about what the roll of the Commission is in that, and whether there is – a formal presentation to the Commission or a check-in every now and then.
  
I am fairly open to what the structure would be, but would just like some sort of report back to the Commission about of the plans for the Department.


 


Commissioner Sugaya:


Yes.
  
Last Wednesday there was a presentation on the Geary Boulevard BRT held at the - in Japantown, which I attended and was not great attendance, but there were,
  
I think, a lot of concerns, especially over the consolidation of bus stops along Geary in that stretch, kind of between Laguna and O’Farrell – not O’Farrell, Fillmore. And there were some other concerns that were voiced, but I would hope that MTA would take the comments at least one regarding the Buchanan stop seriously, before they send this document to environmental review. The way it was presented was that this was a staff preferred project and that the staff preferred project would be subject to the EIR, but I hope that they can make some tweaks based on the comments that were voiced at the community and hopefully that will also be presented to them in writing before it goes for environmental review.


 


Commissioner Moore: 


Yesterday there was a comment in the newspapers and again, this morning, that some people are considering filling the tunnel on Geary Street, perhaps indirectly links to that communication, that there was actually a cost figure thrown out, I'd be interested for the Department to wrap that same conversation to what Commissioner Sugaya was just asking, I was just curious to hear a little bit more about it.


 


Commissioner Sugaya:


Just to elaborate a little bit, that was presented at the hearing in the following way: “the Geary BRT is going to move ahead without filling in the Fillmore underpass,” because of the cost factor and they feel they can do the improvements and not jeopardize anything in the future that might take place with respect to filling in that underpass, but it definitely is not a part of the Geary BRT at this time.

Director’s Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


Thank you.
  
Excuse my tardiness today.
  
I just wanted to report to you that we have the Director of DBI Tom Hui and I, and other Department heads, have concluded our response to the Mayor’s Executive Directive on the housing issues, housing preservation and production. I think that you recall that we have 3 tiers of responses, short-term, mid-term and long-term.
   
The short-term changes were changes that could be made without legislation, without policy changes, that the Departments can implement immediately and we are directing staff this week to make some of those changes. The longer-term changes and mid-term changes we are recommending that they be taken up by the Mayor’s new task force, that he is in the process of forming, to talk about housing production, affordable, and middle income housing in particular, and we have packaged those, so to speak, as a separate package that will be transmitted to the Mayor’s new Task Force.
  
I am happy to share all the memos and I we'll get them to you in the next day or so, as this process moves forward. I think and I know that Commissioner Wu has expressed interest on this, I think, we certainly, if you desire to have a separate hearing, to talk about this more robustly and more specifics if you like.

Review of Past Week’s Events at the Board of Supervisors, Board of Appeals and Historic Preservation Commission


 


LAND USE COMMITTEE:
  


·
         
Enforcement hearing. 
On Monday, Supervisors Weiner and Cohen requested a hearing the Land Use Committee on the Code Enforcement Policies and Procedures. Various City Departments were asked to present background information on their programs, including enforcement statistics and examples of problematic cases. City agencies who presented include: DBI, Planning, Fire and Health.
    
The Supervisors expressed concerns about coordination between department’s.
  
Suggested improvements included a shared complaint tracking system, consolidating enforcement functions into one agency and legislative solutions to improve enforcement tools.
  
Ultimately, the Committee continued the item to allow for further review of possible improvements.


 




·
         
Supervisor Wiener’s technical amendments to the Transit Impact Development Fee was also at LU. 
On December 12, 2013, this Commission considered and recommended approval of the proposed ordinance. The proposed ordinance clarifies language regarding fee exemptions, by eliminating project-specific references to redevelopment areas.
  
The existing language would expand to cover all projects subject to a development agreement, redevelopment plan, owner participation agreement, interagency cooperation agreement, or similar document. The ordinance also amends the method and timing of calculating the fee to make it consistent with other development impact fees charged by the City.
  
Supervisors Wiener and Kim noted that the legislation would improve administration of the TIDF and were pleased that development projects Citywide would be treated fairly and equally with regard to assessment of TIDF. There were no public comments.
 


·
         
The Land Use Committee moved this legislation forward to the full Board with positive recommendation.Planning staff also presented the Interagency Plan Implementation Committee (IPIC) report.
  
This report details the capital plan for 6 area plans and over $110 Million dollars of Impact Fee funds.
  
The same report was presented to the PC in December.
  
Board Committee members expressed support for the work and concern around implementing the planned transportation infrastructure in a timely manner, especially in Eastern Neighborhoods. 
 
Next steps, the capital projects will be approved through the FY2015 budget process. 




 


FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: 


·
         
The Affordable Housing SUD for 1500 Page Street was approved on First Reading this week.

The Commission approved of this Ordinance on 12/19.


·
         
Landmark Designation for Marcus Boos at 1712 Fillmore Street was approved by the Board on final reading this week.


·
         
All of the ordinances associated with the Adjacent Parcels were also adopted on Final Reading.


 


INTRODUCTIONS:

Norman Yee.


 


This ordinance will be scheduled for your consideration within the next three months.
  
Next I’m going to describe three ordinances which do not amend the Planning Code.
  
As such, these ordinances will not be scheduled before the commission, unless requested by a majority of commissioners or under the direction of the Commission President. 


 


·
         
140096 Administrative Code - Tenant Relocation Assistance Payment.

David Campos, Jane Kim, John Avalos, Eric Mar.


·
         
140094 Housing Code - Housing Access - Extending Protections to All Persons Sharing Housing. 
 
Draft Ordinance amending the Housing Code, Chapter 5, Section 503(d), "Housing Access," to promote affordable housing by extending the protections of that section to all persons sharing housing by deleting the references to "families," and to specify that both prospective and current tenants are protected; and amending Section 503(b), "Superficial Floor Area," to make a technical correction. 
John Avalos.


·
         
140095 Administrative Code--Residential Rent Stabilization and Arbitration Ordinance: Prohibit Rent Increases and Evictions Based on Additional Occupants.
 Draft Ordinance amending Administrative Code, Chapter 37, “Residential Rent Stabilization and Arbitration Ordinance,” Sections 37.3 and 37.9, to prohibit rent increases based on the addition of occupants, even where a pre-existing rental agreement or lease otherwise permits a rent increase for additional occupants—this ordinance provides for a number of exceptions to this requirement.
  
John Avalos.


 


BOARD OF APPEALS:


The Board of Appeals met last week and also last night. A couple of items that might of interest, the first is 1601 Larkin Street. There was an appeal of the variance decision letter for that project and the Board ultimately, unanimously upheld the variance decision for that project. A couple of other items from last night,
  
272 Upper Terrace, which was a variance
  
that we issued
  
for a fence that was built
  
11 feet tall, we had conditioned it to be 11 feet tall, but 10 feet is what is allowed under the code, but it’s up on Mt. Olympus.
  
There was a lot of neighborhood concern about the impacts on view,
   
we had a variance hearing in August with a lot of turnout, we conditioned it, to lower it from what it was, to legalize this fence, but the neighbors weren't satisfied that that condition went far enough, so it was appealed. The Board did not actually have a vote last night, there was a two to two to overturn the variance decision so it failed and there was no subsequent motion. So, by act of law the variance decision was upheld. Finally, 2853 Broderick Street, last night there was an appeal of a DPW sidewalk encroachment permit, but this item had been before you, under DR back in 2012, and you conditioned to limit the addition of the building or increasing the height at the garage, to specifically 36 inches. The permits had been issued and there were allegations raised about the accuracy of the plans. We found that it appears that the plans were inaccurate and it was showing the building going from 34 ft. to 37 ft., for a 3 ft. increase, but in reality it seems that it
  
went from 37 ft., to 40 ft.. It was still an increase of 3 ft.
  
We're working with the project sponsor to get the project back to you with revised plans, they’re also, now proposing a dwelling unit merger, but I wanted to make you aware of that.
  
This has been ongoing for about the last year, these allegations for the last 9 months and yesterday, ultimately I suspended all the active permits on the property to get revised plans a little bit more quickly. We also requested that the Board continue the appeal on the sidewalk encroachment permit to the Call of Chair, which they did, so we can hopefully get all the permit issues all wrapped up. So, I am available for any questions.


 


HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION:


Good afternoon, Commissioners Tim Frye, Department staff, here to share with you yesterday’s -
  
the results of yesterday’s Historical Preservation Commission hearing. The Historic Preservation Commission received an informational presentation on the Recreation and Open Space Element. After some discussion by the Commission and public comment, urging that preservation policies be expanded within the Element, the Commission continued the item to its February 19
th
 hearing to give the Department more time to directly response to the questions raised by the members of the public and also give the Commissioners a little more time to mull over exactly what type of approach they would like to take
  
with the preservation, any proposed preservation policies within that Element. I'll keep you updated on the results of that hearing. The Commission also issued or granted a Major Permit to Alter for 300 Post Street also known as the Apple Store,
  
the vote was 6 to 1. After much discussion about the design, the plaza, the proposed variance and code amendments,
  
the HPC in its approval amended the conditions regarding the care and restoration of the Ruth Asawa
  
Fountain and
  
Pilar LaValley, of preservation staff, will be here with Liz Watty in case you have any specific questions about the HPC’s discussion once that item is called on your agenda later today. The Commission also forwarded a positive recommendation for a proposed national register district nomination for the Union Iron Works Historic District, this is located in – along Pier 70, and as you know the Port is using the historic district nomination to leverage Federal Rehabilitation Tax Credits for many of the historic buildings located at that site. It’s my understanding that the State Historic Resources Commission is meeting either today or possibly next week, but we’ll keep posted on that designation. Finally, the staff -- Planning staff gave an overview of our Certified Local Government Annual Report, this is a requirement of the State, every year to report back on the activities of the Historic Preservation Commission, and our Historic Preservation Program. The Commissioners reviewed the Report and at the end of Report identified several goals for the upcoming year, just in summary, the Commission would like us to update the Historic Preservation portion of the Planning Department’s website to make it a little more user friendly and provide more information to the public on the Historic Preservation Program. We're going to continue our outreach and expand participation in the Historic Preservation Program, primarily through our Community Ambassadors Program that you are aware of.
  
Commission would also like us to expand our outreach in coordination with the Assessor Recorders Office regarding to the Mills Acts Program, the property tax savings, applied to historic properties in San Francisco. And then finally, as part of that discussion there was a hearing request for a future hearing to discuss the role of the Historic Preservation Commission and the Department in promoting the Federal and State Rehabilitation Tax Credits as an economic development tool.
  
So we are going to have that discussion, hopefully in the next few months and we will report back to you on the outcome of that item. That concludes my comments unless you have any questions.
