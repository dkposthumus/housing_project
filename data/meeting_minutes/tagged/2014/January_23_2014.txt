Request for Conditional Use Authorization
, pursuant to Planning Code Sections 178, 303 and 304, to modify conditions of approval of a Planned Unit Development (PUD) located at 901 California Street (d.b.a Stanford Court Hotel) within the RM-4 (Residential, Mixed, High Density) Zoning District, the Nob Hill Special Use District, and 65-A and 320-E Height and Bulk District.  Motion 6241 permitted a hotel with incidental commercial uses and professional offices and conditioned that 100 parking spaces be provided within an existing garage located at 875 California Street, converting it entirely to parking for the hotel.  The Project Sponsor is asking for a modification under Planning Code Section 304 to reduce the parking provided for the hotel to seven spaces, providing it in the hotel’s existing porte cochere. A separate Conditional Use Authorization application, 2013.1130C, is being sought to reclassify the garage at 875 California Street as a community parking garage use.  This action constitutes the Approval Action for the project for the purposes of CEQA, pursuant to Section 31.04(h) of the San Francisco Administrative Code.

Commissioner Borden:


Last week I went, at the request of some neighborhood folks and business owners in the Bayview, to look at the site where the Mother Brown Special Use District
  
is being proposed for the homeless shelter. It was actually a fascinating walk, because there were some many interesting businesses around there, ranging from food business to a testing - a chemical testing lab that actually tests toxins in the food and it’s the place on the West Coast, for food imported into the US, stops there for companies to tests for toxins and other things. Another place, I saw next door, had micro-tractors, and does a lots work around pets and pharmaceuticals.
  
So, it’s actually really fascinating to see all the different kinds of businesses and things that are going on and the work the City is doing there to really improve itself.
  
Their concerns are whether or not the location of the shelter, of course, is appropriate for what the needs are and their other concern is whether or not there's actually, the population, the homeless population in the neighborhood to take advantage of that shelter. There are some concerns around whether or not there's social equity happening in the City in terms of [inaudible] and social services. It was interesting to talk to them and to hear about their issues and to learn more about it, and I definitely recommend other Commissioners to, if you get an invitation from them, I think this will be interesting just generally to see the types of things that are going on in our City, that we really don’t even realize. Secondly,
  
I went last night to the Formula Retail Focus Group, which Commissioner Fong was also in attendance, and I know we will hear more about that later, I found that very interesting and I look forward to discussing it further.


 


Commissioner Sugaya:


 
Yes, I would like to get some clarification from staff probably to the Mayor's Office. Mayor Lee announced as part of his Housing Plan the creation of thirty thousand new housing units, at least, that’s how it was reported in the paper, but it wasn’t clear, I don't think, what that thirty thousand was referring to.
  
Because there are entitled projects to the tune of something like, what? 50 thousand in the pipeline report that includes the Lennar project at ten thousand something, Treasure Island at eight thousand, and Park Merced about fifty-seven hundred units and about another three thousand that are entitled. It also, we also, have around, in the pipeline report, around seven hundred units that have plans and so, could we get some clarification? Is he referring to thirty thousand new units on top of the pipeline, do you know? Or are these included in some way.


 


Director Rahaim:


We could certainly; it will help to get clarification on that. My understanding is that it’s thirty thousand units that will actually come on line and be available, actually built, some of which are entitled, many of which, are entitled. So, the idea is try to get that number built in the next six years.


 


Commissioner Sugaya:


But it includes all the stuff in the pipeline at the moment? Okay.

Director’s Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


Commissioners, I just wanted to report to you on last week’s meeting on the Housing Task Force that is being chaired by Director Hui, of DBI and myself. We had a very good discussion last week about a number of comments and a number of ideas that both departments put on the table for addressing the current housing situation. Frankly, it went thru a very long laundry list of ideas, and the idea being to, kind of see which of these items could move forward. Tomorrow's meeting we're working with DBI
  
to combine the two Department lists
  
and to prioritize those lists and we've been asked
  
by the Mayor to respond
  
to the Executive Director
  
by the end of the month, so we have about a week, to do that. Obviously there will be follow up work, but we just need to report to him what actions we're taking both in the short-term, actually short-term, mid-term and long-term, and the idea is that -- the short-term actions are
  
primarily actions that City Departments can take to streamline our process a bit, such as having the Departments do concurrent parallel reviews
  
rather
  
than subsequentual reviews, that is an issue
  
that several folks have raised,
  
looking
  
at how we make sure that how we prioritize projects that are one hundred percent affordable or projects that have a higher level of affordability than a typical market rate project . We're also reviewing some legislative changes, which of course will take a little bit longer
  
to move forward with, and so, we will be preparing a draft memo, actually staff is working on it right now, we'll certainly share that with you all as we move forward
  
and
  
then we will be discussing it with the Task Force tomorrow afternoon to get their feedback on this response to the Mayor.
  
Certainly, if you have any more questions, I am happy to talk in more detail in a future hearing as well.
