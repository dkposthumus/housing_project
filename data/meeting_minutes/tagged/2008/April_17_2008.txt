Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 Requested a copy to be distributed to the Commission of the City's Commission study about the article in the paper last week that talked about an understatement of population -- that there are more people living in San Francisco than [what] the census showed.


-
 
 Also, changes that have been disclosed in this study as to income levels and the twelve lowest income neighborhoods form 1990 to the time of the study and the amount of money spent on retail products outside of the neighborhoods.


-
 
 I thought this was a very important study to have because within the next couple of years we are going to be looking at the Housing Element questions.


Commissioner W. Lee


-
 
 A couple of request: 
 
maybe the City Attorney's Office can give us an update next week regarding the litigation on the Housing Element.


-
 
 Secondly, I'm requesting staff or the Director to give us the status of the Bicycle Plan that has been challenged.


-
 
 Requested Director [Rahaim] to meet with the Bicycle Coalition Director Cheng.


-
 
 Also, I would like some information on how the Bicycle Plan, as proposed, relates to the Eastern Neighborhoods.


Commissioner Sugaya


-
 
 Last week the San Francisco Architectural Heritage had their annual fundraising event and Director Rahaim attended.


Commissioner Olague


-
 
 I received a phone call from a member of the public regarding 2525 Mission [Street].
 
 I will call to confirm the address and call staff to get an update.


-
 
 The Presidio is something that we will eventually be getting a brief on.


-
 
 We discussed the Academy of Arts and the Flower Mart but it seems that the Flower Mart is sort of an issue.
 
 Eventually I would like to understand what is going on with that site at some level.
 
 I will explain that later.


-
 
 There is something on the ballot.
 
 I keep hearing that 98 and 99 will have serious implications in terms of how zoning and planning take place in the City.


Director Rahaim


-
 
 My understanding is that we can do an objective analysis of the ballot but as staff or as a Commission, we are not to take a public position.


Commissioner Sugaya


-
 
 There was a recent article in the Examiner that Bryan O'Neil, Superintendent, has issued a letter that at this point he does not believe that the current proposal on the main playground is not a conformance with the plans at the Presidio.

580 HAYES STREET

Request for Conditional Use Authorization
. The project requires Conditional Use Authorization for an institutional use above the ground floor, for a non-residential use larger than 3,000 square feet and for development of a lot larger than 10,000 square feet. The site is within the Hayes-Gough Neighborhood Commercial District, and a 50-X Height and Bulk District, but is to be rezoned under the pending Market and Octavia Area Plan Code Amendments to the Hayes-Gough Neighborhood Commercial Transit District and a 55-X Height and Bulk District. The project complies with the pending Code Amendments but does not comply with current zoning. The project proposes to demolish the existing building and construct a mixed use building containing approximately 2,700 square feet of ground floor retail space along Hayes Street, an assisted living facility of approximately 48 units, 42 independent living group housing units for seniors and 17 off-street parking spaces in an underground garage accessed off of Ivy Street. The proposed building would be 5 stories and 55 feet in height over a below grade basement, totaling approximately 63,000 square feet.


Preliminary Recommendation: Adopt a Motion of Intent to adopt a motion approving the project, with conditions, once the Market and Octavia Area Plan Code Amendments become effective.

 The project site is within an RC-4 (Residential-Commercial Combined, High-Density) District, the North of Market Residential Special Use District, and an 80-T Height and Bulk District.

SPEAKER(S)


Judy West


-
 
 I'm disappointed with the entire process and I encourage the new director to review some of the early hearings in 2002 because many of the suggestions made to not do are being done now.


Tim Colen, Housing Action Coalition


-
 
 We have not digested the details on this yet but we are going to be working intensively on it. 
 
We want to have jobs and housing placed in close proximity to each other.


Ingrid Aquino


-
 
 I do not see the neighborhood represented in this plan at all -- residents, youth, seniors, and working class people.
 
 I just see this as a wealthy people's proposal.


Jeffrey Leibovitz


-
 
 We support the SLI for the East SoMa and we think that area should be looked at more carefully before any decision we make at this point regarding housing.


-
 
 It is important to consider jobs and transportation before going on to consider other uses.


Dwight Dolliver


-
 
 Put the low cost housing on an equitable basis throughout the City and not in one small area [Mission District].


Silvia Johnson


-
 
 Our lives are more important than playing games. 
 
You have a responsibility and this needs more structure.


Chris Durazo


Meredyth Skemp


-
 
 Some of our goals for this plan include increased housing opportunities for all income levels and well designed housing to preserve and enhance neighborhoods.


James Taskett


-
 
 This is a wonderful opportunity for us to take a look at growth for the future and to apply zoning that allows for a long standing plan. 
 
Look at the potential for height limits in industrial and PDR areas.


Sara Karlinsky


-
 
 Preservation of PDR and encouragement of affordable housing are important goals. 
 
Also, I urge you to think about environmental goals on how to link land use and transportation.


Greg Miller


-
 
 Requested clarification on the heights of East SoMa and if it is still part of the Eastern Neighborhoods process.


Bob Mayers

I urge you to look at the Western SoMa to see what the community has come up with and try to use that kind of template and apply it to this plan.
