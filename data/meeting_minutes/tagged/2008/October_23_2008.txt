UPPER MARKET COMMUNITY VISION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
 
(FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MARKET & OCTAVIA AREA PLAN FUNDAMENTAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES) -
 
The San Francisco Planning Department has published two documents for the Upper Market Corridor, they are the  Upper Market Community Vision and Recommendations  and the  Upper Market Development Design Guidelines. .
 
 The plan area generally includes properties fronting Market Street between Octavia Boulevard on the east and Castro Street on the west.
 


 


Prior to initiating community workshops, the Department and its consultant team explored existing conditions in the neighborhood.
 
 The Department conducted outreach meetings with representatives of the Castro and nearby neighborhood organizations.
 
 The Department held three community workshops.
 
 The themes of the workshops focused on: 1.) Community Vision (September 2007); 2.) Community Design Framework (October 2007); and 3.) Design Strategies (December 2007).
 
 The outcome of the workshops are two documents that contains a program for public realm improvements and design guidelines for private development that incorporate the identity, character, economic and social composition of the Upper Market area and its surrounding neighborhoods.


 


The documents respond to physical, social, and economic conditions in the Project area, and establish a plan for public and private improvements in the Project Area.
 
 The Upper Market Community Vision and Recommendations document identifies existing physical, infrastructure and economic conditions in the Upper Market neighborhood, considers historical context and identifies key neighborhood assets, challenges and opportunities to revitalize the neighborhood.
 
 It includes an Urban Design Framework section that: describes planning strategies that may be used to guide urban design improvements along the upper Market Street corridor.
 
 The Upper Market Community Vision and Recommendations document also proposes improvements to the public realm, including public spaces, sidewalks, and plazas.
 


 


The Upper Market Development Design Guidelines incorporates principles that may be used to guide design character for new buildings, and provides an overview of the steps that may be taken to achieve neighborhood improvements.


 


These two documents:


 




Identifies the community's five highest priority public infrastructure improvement projects,


Actions that neighborhood residents, business owners and community organizations may take to support improvements, and


The Upper Market Development Design Guidelines outlines design guidelines that may be used by both developers and city planners


The Upper Market Community Vision and Recommendations also identifies potential funding sources for street and sidewalk improvements. "




Preliminary Recommendation: Acknowledgement of the Upper Market Community Vision and Recommendations and Endorsement of the Upper Market Development Design Guidelines."

1 La Avanzada Street
/Sutro Tower Digital Television
Project
 
- 
CERTIFICATION OF FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT (EIR)
. The proposed project would involve conversion of the television antennas on Sutro Tower from the current combination of analog and digital to an all-digital system. Project components would include: 1) replacement of nine existing analog main antennas at the top of Sutro Tower with no more than five digital main antennas; 2) structural upgrades to the tower to enable the tower to meet 
Building Code
 wind resistance requirements for an  essential facility  and to accommodate the placement of new digital television equipment on the tower; 3) removal of four digital main television antennas; 4) removal of nine analog auxiliary television antennas and installation of three digital auxiliary antennas; 5) alteration, replacement, or addition of small ancillary and accessory antennas and equipment associated with the operation of Sutro Tower broadcasters; and 6) addition of auxiliary equipment, and electrical, elevator, and public safety improvements associated with the proposed project. The project would result in an overall net reduction of approximately 14 television antennas, from 22 to 8 antennas. There would be no expansion of the tower itself or the ancillary buildings at the base of the tower.
 
 The project site is located at Assessor's Block 2724 Lot 003, in an RH-1(D) zoning district and a 40-X Height and Bulk district.
