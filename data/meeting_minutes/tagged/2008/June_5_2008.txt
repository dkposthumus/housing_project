1.
 
SUE BIERMAN PARK
 - 
Discussion and possible action to approve a resolution allocating up to $1,812,000, from the Downtown Park Special Fund for Phase I renovation of Sue Bierman Park and a planning study for the Embarcadero Waterfront Open Space.


 


SPEAKER(S)


Ernestine Weiss, Golden Gate Center


-
 
 The connection bridge to Maritime Plaza should be demolished because it is dangerous and obsolete and nobody told us about the retention of the bridge. 
 
I find that disturbing.


Sue Hestor, Friends of Golden Gateway Representative


-
 
 There needs to be an inviting way to circulate from Broadway to Mission Street on the west side of the Embarcadero.


-
 
 My plea is that the planning study expands its vision on how to make it inviting to walk along the Embarcadero as opposed to just the bay side.
 
 Planning has the responsibility to take all of this into consideration.




Diana Taylor, Barbary Coast Neighborhood Association


-
 
 We support the granting of funds and planning efforts and would like to be involved in the planning process with any citizen's advisory and design review committee.


Vetica Puree, Telegraph Hill Dwellers


-
 
 We have a tremendous interest and are ecstatic that you will allocate funds for Sue Bierman Park as well as for the planning study because it would allows our citizens to be able to walk easily and freely.


Eula Walters


-
 
 There is nothing wrong with Ferry Park [Sue Bierman Park]. 
 
It is the most beautiful park in the City.
 
 Some of or a few sidewalks need to be leveled.


-
 
 The bridge should stay there because we need it for emergencies.


Chris Duderstadt, Open Space of San Francisco Tomorrow


-
 
 Looking at that part of the City, we have no spaces for unstructured recreational activities.
 
 Consider that in all of your planning efforts.


Dave Burnett, Golden Gateway Center


-
 
 There are a lot of drug activities in the park and I hope that whatever is done in the future you take that into account.


 


ACTION:
 
 
Approved the expenditure of $100,000 to conduct the planning study for the Embarcadero Waterfront Open Space but to require more detailed information about the bridge and the expenditure of the additional $1.7 million from the Downtown Park Special Fund for renovation of the park.
