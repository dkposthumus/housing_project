COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS

 Commission Comments/Questions




.
 
 Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).


.
 
 At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.




Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 I have received phone calls and correspondence from a number of people who were involved in the Market – Octavia Plan with a general concern that an action is being contemplated by the Land Use Committee of the Board of Supervisors in regards to revisions to the Plan.


-
 
 I would hope that we would be able to stay with the plan because it took many years to formulate and it addresses parking, housing and the compromise from a number of different parties.


Commissioner Moore


-
 
 Asked Mr. Badiner [Zoning Administrator] what enforcement actions we have for properties that intentionally are blighting neighborhoods from neglect of properties; with food being dumped in the entry of the property, clothes, graffiti, etc.?


-
 
 There are two properties in my neighborhood that I am very concerned about.
 
 One is the church on Clay and Larkin Streets and the other one is 1285 Sutter Street, which is inviting the same type of behavior.


Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator


-
 
 The City does not have a blighting ordinance. 
 
These would probably be dealt with by DPW [Department of Public Works].


-
 
 I believe it is being looked into again by Ed Lee, the City's Administrator.
 
 We are seriously considering a blighting ordinance.


Commissioner Moore


Commissioner Sugaya


-
 
 Secondly, in this morning's paper there was an article on one of the Port's sea lots that is up for development. 
 
And at some point [I'd like staff to] work with the Port staff and have an informational presentation.

 There is a selection committee that I am sitting on for the selection of the developer and architect for that property.

 DIRECTOR'S REPORT

 Director's Announcements


 


John Rahaim, Director


-
 
 As I mentioned last time, I have been trying to be more organized in our response on the Action List.


-
 
 I would like to propose that we talk about that in the conversation that we will have in two weeks on the rules and procedures and talk about more specific strategies of how to respond to that more formally.


-
 
 Before that meeting, I am going to ask staff to update the status of those items and make sure that we can get that to you before that meeting.


-
 
 The second item: 
 
it has come up a few times -- the issue of the design quality of buildings you are seeing and how to try to address some of that and perhaps find ways that get projects to you in a better shape.


-
 
 Commissioner Moore suggested that I might make a presentation to the Commission of some of the work that we did in Seattle in this regard and I am happy to do that.


-
 
 There are some particular projects in the 40-47 story range which is a very common building type happening in neighborhood-commercial districts in Seattle that have design review guidelines that apply to those buildings.


-
 
 I think there are some good design principles that came out of those projects that can be applied.


Amit Ghosh – Chief Planner


-
 
 I did inquire of Ted Eagan's Office about the economic assessment of Supervisor Ammiano's legislation in the Mission on restricting fast food stores. 
 
He is working on a report and it would be ready by the end of next week.

Request for Conditional Use Authorization
 to add a full bar use to an existing full-service restaurant (d.b.a.  La Parrilla Grill .) No physical expansion of the existing building is proposed nor any interior modifications.
 
 The bar use will require a type 47 ABC license which allows sale of beer, wine and distilled spirits for consumption on the premises, in conjunction with a bona fide eating
 
 establishment. This site is within the Polk Street Neighborhood Commercial District, and a 65-A Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions

Marsha Garland, Project Sponsor Representative


-
 
 The intention is to operate as a full service restaurant all day long with no separate bar service.


-
 
 We have tried to meet several times with the opponents but it was always in the attack mode and not really a dialogue.


(-)John Gallagher, Police Department


-
 
 Recommended denial of this license because the district is oversaturated and they are coming from outside.


(+)Rita Alviar


-
 
 Spoke in support because the owner owns another location on Folsom Street and it is clean and does not create any problems in the neighborhood.


(+)Michael Flore, Manager


-

This proposal would only be to have a drink with the meal. 
 
This is something that many of our customers have requested.

(+)Carl Hilsz

(-)Michael Schoolnik

(+)Marina


-
 
 They have sophisticated food with good prices. 
 
he only thing missing is the traditional Latino drinks - and not to get drunk - but to compliment the meal.


(+)Erick Arguello


-
 
 La Parrilla Grill is a member of our association on 24

(+)Michael Nulty


-
 
 We need to have businesses that are viable and they have to have the tools to be viable.


(+)John Nulty

(-)Dawn Trennert


-
 
 Unusual notification process that they used with the poster saying that the hearing was in June and the mailing happened this week.


-
 
 The plan described verbally contradicts stipulations in Exhibit A of the proposed conditional use.


Vladimir Abramon, Owner


-
 
 I have a Masters Degree in Business and I know how to develop a business plan.
 
 We did research before opening the restaurant and we do have a plan.

 We met with associations and many people support this conditional use.

Ahmad Larizadeh, Project Sponsor


-
 
 We support small businesses in this area but seems like you are not.


-
 
 We do not need a liquor license. 
 
We only need wine testing.


Marsha Garland


-
 
 I contacted a friend who is an expert on the ABC law and I have a copy of his definition of the 42 license.

 I think the confusion is that The Planning Department defines wine testing type 42 with a certain set of words that includes bars. 
 
But in reality, does not include wine testing rooms.

 We have a petition with 172 signatures from people in the neighborhood and businesses supporting this application.


-
 
 The neighbors are asking for this business because the lot has been vacant for a long time.


-
 
 This is for a wine tasting room.


(+)Stefano Cassolato


-
 
 This is going to be a place for people wanting to buy a bottle of wine and having a lot of education regarding the purchase. 
 
They will be using the sense of taste.


(-)Joan Wood


-
 
 Read portion of a letter from the President of the Telegraph Hill Dwellers previously submitted to the Commission opposing this application.


(+)Lynn Jefferson


-
 
 We have a lot of vacancies in North Beach and we might have more. 
 
This is a tasting room and it is not becoming a bar.


(+)Jalal Heydari


-
 
 It is not our intention to become a bar, but to offer customers the opportunity to sample the product.


(+)Carl Hilsz


-
 
 There are a lot of vacant stores and this is a viable business that can occupy that site and provide additional revenues to benefit the community.

SPEAKER(S)


Tuia Catalano, Project Sponsor Representative


-
 
 This site was purchased in late 2004. 
 
The project sponsor has put together a great infill project compatible with the neighborhood that includes many of the features and components that the City is looking for in projects like this.


-
 
 The variance would allow us a better ground floor plan with more retail and the ability to provide more usable open space elsewhere in the project.


-
 
 The project is complaint with the current Code and is consistent with other City policies.


-
 
 This project includes family housing with two or more bedrooms, affordable units on site, PDR uses, neighborhood serving retail uses, and sufficient parking to satisfy needs.


-
 
 This is an excellent opportunity to develop an underutilized lot.


-
 
 There have been four neighborhood notifications and we are not aware of any opposition to the project.


(+)Philip Lesser


-
 
 It is a wonderful project for this part of the Mission District with schools, City College, and playgrounds nearby bringing in more families.


(-)Sue Hestor


-
 
 Questioned if this is really going to be for families with the open space on the 5
th
 floor.


-
 
 The project should be compared with what the median income, household size, and family size is in the Mission.


Jaime Trejo


-
 
 If this is approved, you should question the size of the condominiums and determine if it is possible to increase the BMR [Below Market Rate] units.

Ordinance introduced by Supervisor Ammiano amending the San Francisco Planning Code by adding Section 785 to establish the Mission/Bernal Formula Retail Restricted Use Subdistrict; amending Section 703.3 to prohibit formula retail uses in the Mission/Bernal Formula Retail Restricted Use Subdistrict; amending Sectional Maps SU 07 and SU 11 of the Zoning Map of the City and County of San Francisco to establish the boundaries of the Mission/Bernal Formula Retail Restricted Use Subdistrict; adopting finding, including environmental findings and findings of consistency with the priority policies of Planning Code Section 101.1 and the General Plan.


Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Modifications


(Continued from Regular Meeting of February 7, 2007)


 


SPEAKER(S)


Pilar Chavo, Supervisor Ammiano's Office


-
 
 We heard the concerns, suggestions and recommendations from the Planning Department and made changes on this legislation and introduced a substitute piece of legislation last Tuesday at the Board of Supervisors.


-
 
 One of them was to address some of the discrepancies between the legislation and the map that Planning issued.


-
 
 We still have some questions about some of the outer layers that were on the map and the planning notice.


-
 
 Some of the blocks and lots that it said were included in the legislation were not, but there were some missing ones. 
 
We need a little clean up on that.


-
 
 We also heard the recommendation to make the change to allow formula retail to replace itself if they have existed during the three years prior to the effective date of the legislation.


-
 
 The other change that we considered was amending to eliminate the quarter mile non conforming use requirement. 
 
We consulted with the City Attorney who suggested that it is not necessary to specify in the language regarding that requirement.


-
 
 However, in an effort to prevent misinterpretation in the future and be consistent, Supervisor [Ammiano] is happy to make that change as well.


-
 
 The Commission was concerned about having more time until having the Economic Impact. 
 
The report is coming out today or tomorrow or early next week. 
 
The Supervisor is happy to give a two week extension to consider that report and to include the changes in the legislation.


-
 
 Supervisor Ammiano has been concerned that chain stores would encroach in the Mission and Bernal Districts raising rents and displacing small local merchants.
 
 This legislation's intent is to protect small independent merchants.


-
 
 After talking to about 250 merchants only three of them opposed this legislation.


(-)Anita Correa


-
 
 This would be a proposed ban with no outreach to the merchant groups who would be the most affected.


(+)Joanne Wong-Lam


-
 
 Supports the Planning Department's recommendations that would help determining the financial feasibility of the amendment and to ensure that there is no decrease in community services.


(-)Richard Ventura


-
 
 Thanked the Commission for extending the comment period and encouraged having all the data before making any recommendation.


-
 
 Concerned about protection of existing businesses that are valuable in serving the community.


(-)Claudia Castillo


-
 
 Our organization, San Francisco Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, was not approached or consulted prior to the introduction of this ordinance to contribute relevant feedback especially this one that would impact tremendously our community.


(-)[No name stated]


-
 
 We are very concerned that we were not notified to represent our community regarding this legislation because it is going to impact small businesses.


(-)Rick Gomez


-
 
 We need to have the right formula retail to serve the community on what the community needs. 
 
This is going in a bad direction.


(-)Judith Berkowitz


-
 
 I urge you to send this proposed legislation back to the Board of Supervisors with a strong recommendation for disapproval because no extra special restrictions should be invoked.


(-)Rita Alviar


-
 
 The people in the Mission District did not have an opportunity to give any feedback, and property owners were not even included in this discussion.


Erick Arguello


-
 
 The general consensus is in support of the ban along 24
th
 Street but not on Mission Street because there we have retailers that cater to the working class.


(-)David Blatteis


-
 
 By passing this law, you are going to be closing up the possibilities of bringing new kinds of businesses that we do not even know that they exist. 
 
This is going to affect retailers that provide true services to the community.


(-)Philip Lesser


-
 
 We could do much better than what we currently have because we have many store fronts vacant.


Fred Snyder


-
 
 I am constantly amazed with the process that takes place because the Eastern Neighborhoods is not really in place and we keep going forward.
 
 No businesses can come if they do not know what is going to happen.


Jaime Trejo


-
 
 There are not that many vacant store fronts because many are under construction and many serve the community in the afternoons or evenings.


(-)Debra Niemann


-
 
 Concerned about the impact that this ban is going to have in the community because this is not the best way to control growth and expansion.


(+)Fenny Kuo


-
 
 People want the opportunity to develop a neighborhood there, but I'd rather see more resources given to the community that already exists with growth to the businesses locally owned.


Jordanna Thigpen


 


(+)Kimberly Alvarenga


-
 
 Spoke in support of this legislation because protecting small businesses would present more and ample opportunities for working class in San Francisco as well as maintaining affordable rents for local business owners.


(-)Gillian Gillet


-
 
 This legislation removes competition, flexibility and local choice from the Mission.


(-)Kelton Finney


-
 
 This legislation is completely unnecessary because the requirement for conditional use provides a sufficient level of review.


(-)Amy Sullivan


-
 
 Opposes this legislation because a lot of formula retail provides union jobs with medical insurance in the Mission District.


(-)Laura Muniz


-
 
 This legislation would have severe consequences that cannot be reversed easily.


(+)Paul Johnson


-
 
 Spoke in favor of the modifications because they are well considered and clear.


(-)James Nunemacher


-
 
 We were never contacted about this legislation and I oppose it because it is going to cut out potential future businesses of many kinds coming to the Mission.


(-)Marie Sorenson


-
 
 I urge you to send this back to the Board of Supervisors with a strong recommendation for disapproval because there would not be any more retail formula uses.


(-)Colleen Meharry


-
 
 We were not contacted about this and we have to be able to use our common sense on what should be there and what should not.


(-)Eloise Bates


-
 
 The scope of this is huge and there has not been public input or proper process.


(-)Michael Miller


-
 
 Read a letter from Toby Livy opposing this legislation because residents should be able to do most of the shopping within the neighborhood.


Steve Vettel


-
 
 Staff's recommendation to stick to the conditional use process is appropriate.


-
 
 I ask you to consider a reasonable grandfather clause in the ordinance if you are thinking to recommend approval.


John Mendoza


-
 
 Many people signed the petition for approval without really being informed.


Kate


-
 
 This is going to be a big mess and I do not understand how you are going to maintain the flavor of the neighborhood and the reason why people live there.


(+)Dario Romero


-
 
 Many merchants in the Mission are in support of this legislation and I asked people to come to this Commission and share their opinions.


(-)J.J.


-
 
 This is going to take away the ability to consider projects on a case-by-case basis, giving the public the opportunity to express concerns and support.

 of Building Permit Application
#200702073648 to construct a new single-family dwelling, pending the approval of Demolition Permit #200702073649, to demolish the existing single-family residence at 101 Arbor and approval of Building Permit #200702073645 to construct a new single-family residence at 102 Conrad Street, within an RH-1 (Residential, House, One-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Do Not Take Discretionary Review and approve the project.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of February 7, 2008)


 


SPEAKER(S)


John Larkin, Discretionary Review Requestor


-
 
 The engineer studies regarding the demolition made the remarkable statement that buildings last only 100 years and that the house does not have historical value.


-
 
 The proposed house would be one of the largest in Glen Park.


-
 
 There are only two reasons to have such house: vanity and to split it up in multiple units.


-
 
 Consider scaling it down for a more humanly single family dwelling without the absolute temptation to become a multiple family dwelling unit.


(-)Steve Taylor


-
 
 The property to be demolished is over 100 years old and the historic review of this property states that the building exhibits specific examples of historic character.


(-)Maureen McKeown


-
 
 Opposes the project because the new house would forever destroy the look and feel of our neighborhood.
 
 It is out of character.


Dave O'Dunver, Project Sponsor


-
 
 We intend to move into one of the units and reside there. 
 
We also intend to sell the second dwelling unit to help out with the mortgage.


-
 
 Four neighbors sent letters in support and some others are here to give testimony of support.


Ernie Selander, Architect


-
 
 Historic evaluator and soundness report engineer are here to respond to any questions.


-
 
 We met with the neighborhood and modified the project taking into consideration all the concerns brought to our attention.


-
 
 The scale and density are completely compatible with the neighborhood and has no impact on the Larkin's home.


Robert McCarthy


-
 
 The house has two faulty support systems and two illegal units. 
 
It needs to be replaced and this family is just trying to stay in the City.


(+)Eugene Keegan


-
 
 Urged the Commission to approve the project because it is good to support family housing.


(+)Charlie Robinson


-
 
 This is a big improvement to the neighborhood.


(+)Peter Branngan


-
 
 This is just trying to create two family housing to allow families to stay in Glen Park


(+)Kathleen McDonagh


-
 
 This project of two single homes is going to make a big difference in the neighborhood.


(+)Kelton Finney


-
 
 I wrote the soundness report and cataloged all deficiencies explaining in detail how this building meets the criteria of an unsound building and will be happy to answer questions about the report.


(+)Tim Kelly


-
 
 The project would be a good one for the neighborhood.
 
 From a professional point of view, people tend to be attached to old buildings and see historic value where it is not present.

-
 
 I believe that this new floor would diminish the value of my property.


-
 
 I understand that view is not protected but I'm asking that financial impacts be taken into consideration.


Brian Fox, Project Designer


-
 
 Any vertical addition would create the same conflict for the requestor because of view blockage.


-
 
 We have letters of support from neighbors.


-
 
 We tried from the outset to design a proposal with the greatest chance of approval with the support of the neighbors.


-
 
 We made changes to address neighbors' concerns and took into consideration staff's recommendations.
