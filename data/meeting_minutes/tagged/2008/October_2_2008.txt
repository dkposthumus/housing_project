Commissioner Lee:


 
 My question to the Planning Department is are there projects that we can move along that has high impact that will provide jobs that will be needed in 2009?
 
 I think most will say that in 2009 it does not look good for the San Francisco Bay Area, or for California.
 
 I think as planners we have
 
 to look at high impact projects that will create jobs.
 
 I'm asking the Planning Department to look at what is in the pipeline.
 
 What can we move up fast so we can at least approve the project that hopefully can get financing and will actually build? I'd like to hear under the Director's Report your comments.
