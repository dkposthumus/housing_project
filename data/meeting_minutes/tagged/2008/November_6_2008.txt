Request for 1) Conditional Use Authorization
 to allow dwellings at a density ratio exceeding one dwelling unit per 400 square feet of lot area and 
2) Variance
 from usable open space requirements, within an RTO (Residential, Transit-Oriented Neighborhood) Zoning District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.

The Zoning Administrator will consider the request for Variance from Usable Open Space requirements concurrently with the Planning Commission's consideration of the conditional use authorization at this same hearing.

Public Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Report
.
 
The project site is a single, 15,000-square-foot parcel, between 20th and Cumberland Streets, across Dolores Street from Dolores Park in the Dolores Heights neighborhood. The Second Church of Christ, Scientist, the project sponsor, proposes the demolition of the existing church structure, an un-reinforced masonry building (National Register Status Code 3S, Here Today historic resource survey) on the site and construction of a new approximately 9,000 square foot church building, 13,400 square feet of residential use (8 units) and 12,200 square feet of parking (31 spaces). The proposed residential structures would be three- and four-stories, with a height of 40 feet above grade. The new two-story church building would include a 10.5-foot-high cupola atop a double-height worship area on the second story. Including the cupola, the church would reach about 51 feet in height above grade. The proposed project also includes a lot split which would divide the existing lot into two residential lots of approximately 4,000 square feet, each, and a single, corner lot of approximately 6,800 square feet for the new church building. The project site is within an RH-3 (Residential, House, Three-Family) district, and within a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
