 to convert 65 of the existing 77 residential hotel rooms into tourist hotel rooms within the six-story mixed use structure. This change of use would increase the number of tourist rooms from the existing 66 rooms to a total of 131 tourist hotel rooms with 12 residential hotel rooms still remaining within the building. The project does not propose any modifications to the building exterior or interior and consists of the change of use only.
As required under the San Francisco Administrative Code, the 65 residential hotel rooms at the project site
(to be converted to tourist hotel rooms) will
be replaced at 317 Leavenworth Street.
 
 (A companion variance case for 317 Leavenworth (Case No. 2007.1164V) will be considered by the Zoning Adminstrator concurrently with this case.)

 At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.


 


Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 
I just wanted to bring up the subject of this yogurt shop  The Red Mango' situation because there has been a lot of mention of that in the press.


-
 
 
Briefly, the situation is that a particular individual had gotten the permit and during the time before they were able to activate the business, a number of outlets increased and they became a non-permitted use because they were within the formula retail.


-
 
 
That is part of the history. 
 
There is more to it because there is a conditional use situation too.


-
 
 
I just want Mr. Badiner to talk a little bit about that because my understanding is that previous business had been there.


-
 
 
There is an 18 month situation were food service if it is discontinued for more than 18 months in the North Beach area, then another conditional use is needed.


-
 
 
There is a question of timing and the permit exceeding the 18 months.


Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator


-
 
 
There are a number of issues on Red Mango.
 
 11 or more outlets are considered formula retail and the City requires a conditional use but in the North Beach it is not a permitted use.


-
 
 
The other issue is that this is the former site of the Gold Spite Restaurant that closed.


-
 
 
It was not brought to our attention that the site was vacant for such a long time.


-
 
 
I believe that the project sponsor is now proposing to operate the yogurt store as a full service restaurant. 
 
That raises some questions but the original application was for a small fast food.

 Discussion of the Academy of Art University's code violations, enforcement actions and institutional master plan.


 
 Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Informational/discussion only. No Action.


 


SPEAKER(S)


Jorge Carbonero


-
 
 There are some issues that the Academy of Art is facing that are purely life safety and we would like to move forward independently of other issues that have to do with environmental review, change of use, or conditional use.


Michael Burke, Academy of Arts University Representative


-
 
 We have submitted a letter acknowledging that none of the life safety issues would confer into any use rights.


-
 
 My instructions are to work as quickly as I can to bring the University into compliance and we are doing that.


Jeff


-
 
 
It is not right what the Academy of Arts is trying to do to the Flower Market.






Patrick McCann


-
 
 This town needs the San Francisco Flower Market. 
 
It needs institutions to abide by the rules and not force small businesses out.


Diana Scott


-
 
 Read a letter from a student of the Academy of Arts University sharing their negative experience with the University.


Ann Ronce


-
 
 To provide housing to students at the expense of elderly citizens is unconscionable.


-
 
 I suggest you begin a process to investigate what happens to the tenants of these buildings acquired by the Academy six months before the sale and up to a year after.


Sue Hestor


-
 
 The Academy of Arts University has a practice of ignoring the Planning Department because they have been consistently buying buildings after the warning letters from this department.


-
 
 There needs to be a discussion about whether for-profit educational institutions should be pulled-in under the jobs housing linkage program and require them to build affordable housing.


Joan


-
 
 The Flower Market should remains in San Francisco and I'm asking you to look at the big picture because these businesses would not function in the space that the University intends for them.


 


ACTION:
 
 No Action is required of the Commission.

Board of Appeals


A-
 
 
Notice of Violation Appeal for a Massage Establishment
– Rehearing request -- the Board of Appeals originally upheld the notice of violation in September.
 
 
Original decision was
 
Upheld
 and the Planning Department will now forward the matter on to the City Attorney's Office for enforcement.


B-
 
 
45 Hudson
The use was operating in violation to the Planning Code.
 
 The building permit was granted and eventually appealed.
 
 The Board of Appeals 
upheld
 it because it is in the interim zoning controls requiring conditional use for most uses in the Bayview.
 
 They filed a conditional use and it is coming to this Commission as soon as possible in order to address the enforcement issue.

 Approval with Conditions


 


SPEAKER(S)


Charles Collins, Project Sponsor


-
 
 The new addition will continue the tradition of serving families in the Chinatown community by creating a deeper foundation and increasing the vital program capacity.


-
 
 It would provide safety, studios, a gymnasium, swimming classes, will retain 25-single residence occupancy units, and provide a wellness center.
 
 All will be integrated in the YMCA facilities.


-
 
 We currently serve about 2,000 people and this addition would permit us to serve annually 8,000 people.


Kari Lee, Executive Director of YMCA


-
 
 Submitted over 3,000 post cards and 55 letters of support for the project from the community.


-
 
 Gave a summary of services to the community including after school programs, tutoring, family activities, summer programs, etc.

 [Shared their own experience of growing up as a member of the YMCA and is proud of working there]


Bill Worthington, Vice-President of the YMCA


-
 
 [Presented the revised project with different views including the courtyard, the entrance corridor, sections, and atrium]


-
 
 We would continue working with your staff to improve the atrium by exploring various structural approaches to making the columns and beams as small as we can in order to have as much of the original historic faÃ§ade exposed.


Ford Li, Capital Development Committee


-
 
 [Shared there experience of being in the YMCA and how meaningful it is for youth.]
 
 It is about the people.


-
 
 The new fitness center in the new building is the economic engine to make all this possible.


Wayne Hu, Project Manager


-
 
 We have strong community support.
 
 [Asked supporters in the audience to stand up]


(-)Don L. Whitney


-
 
 Asked for a continuance because there are concerns about excessive height, demolition done without a permit, and the use of the property without a permit.
 
 These are outstanding violations.


(-)Richard Fong


-
 
 This is a landmark area and they are not going to do much in terms of the demographics in the Chinatown area that is in need of residential development.


(+)Enid Lim


-
 
 The proposed redevelopment honors the historical significance structure of the site with its architectural details and allows the YMCA to expand the quality of programs to the community.


(+)Phil Choy


-
 
 The YMCA is an example of the preservation of our history, not just architecturally but with the services to the people as well.


(+)Melvin Lee


-
 
 Requested the Commission to approve this project for the Chinatown community, which would allow the community to benefit from the same experiences we had growing up but with more expanded programs.


(+)Pauline Roothman


-
 
 We do a lot of wonderful things with, in and for the community but we need more space.


(+)Pamela Dufty, Council for the YMCA


-
 
 I have a copy of the 1991 permit for the renovation work done on the second floor, and it is true that it was not finalized because we forgot to call the inspector to review the work that was done.


-
 
 I have the list from 1990 that defines the residential use and I have the 1989 conditional use permit from the Planning Commission.


-
 
 I thing we have dealt with the issues raised by a previous speaker.


(+)Rev. Fong


-
 
 We support this project because we like the increase of affordable housing.


(+)Allen Lee


-
 
 The YMCA is not just a historical place but a safe place for the youth and coming generations.

 I urge the Commission to support this project because it is a place for families to work and enjoy leisure time.


 


ACTION:

Amendments to Planning Code by adding Sections 785 and 786 creating the Excelsior Alcohol Restricted Use District and the North Beach Alcohol Restricted Use District
 
 [Board File No. 07-1464].
Ordinance introduced by Supervisors Peskin and Sandoval amending Planning Code by adding Section 785 to create an Excelsior Alcohol Restricted Use District prohibiting new off-sale liquor establishments
and providing a five-year sunset provision, and adding Section 786 to create an North Beach Alcohol Restricted Use District prohibiting new off-sale liquor establishments and providing for a five-year sunset provision, amending Sectional Maps SU 11 and SU 12 of the Zoning Map of the City and County of San Francisco to establish the boundaries of the Excelsior Alcohol Restricted Use District, and amending Section Map SU 01 to establish the boundaries of the North Beach Alcohol Restricted Use District, making environmental findings and findings of consistency with the General Plan and priority policies of Planning Code Section 101.1. 
Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with Conditions


 


SPEAKER(S)


David Noyola, Office of Supervisor Peskin


-
 
 Over the past 20 years the increase in the number of bars and restaurants in North beach have slowly but surely been crowded out.


-
 
 The idea is to try to preserve small businesses that make the neighborhood what it is. 
 
However, we are wide open to suggestions from the Planning Department to figure out ways to do that.


-
 
 We would love to incorporate your suggestions on how to do this best.


-
 
 Establish the number of existing permits for alcohol use and say that would be as many as permitted in this area going forward.


(+)Steven Currier, President of Outer Mission Residents Association


-
 
 This is good for us and we look forward to it and hope the Commission would support the moratorium.


(-)Tony Gantner, North Beach Merchants Associations


-
 
 I'm concerned that his would result in many more empty stores.
 
 It contains many provisions that are hard to interpret for the North Beach.


(-)Robert DiFranco


-
 
 This legislation, as written, would not allow opening of restaurants with a beer/wine license in the North Beach where it is low in these types of businesses.


(-)Jalal Heydari, North Beach


-
 
 We are proposing a wine shop and are in the process and are coming before the Commission on January 31.
 
 This would stop the permit process.


(-)Kathleen Dooley, President of North Beach Merchants Association


-
 
 The continuing disappearance of neighborhood serving businesses in North Beach is a disturbing trend and needs to be addressed but we do not believe that this legislation is the solution.


(-)Marsha Garland, North Beach Chamber of Commerce


-
 
 The intent of this legislation is to force out businesses and not allow any new liquor licenses to come in. 
 
There has not been outreach to neighborhood organizations for input on this legislation.


(-)Stefano Cassolato, North Beach Chamber of Commerce


-
 
 No one in the community was contacted to discuss this vital legislation.
 




(-)Carl Hilsz


-
 
 It would be almost impossible for businesses to survive without the selling of alcohol in the North Beach area.


(-)Steve Worsley


-
 
 This legislation needs more time to be understood.


(-)Terrance Alan, SF Late Night Coalition


-
 
 This legislation needs to go back and be rethought for the community benefit.


(-)Lynn Jefferson, North Beach Neighbors


-
 
 This legislation is not going to help anybody. 
 
The community needs to be involved in this.


(-)Martin Kickwood, Terra Nova Projects


-
 
 This legislation needs to be split because it suits the Excelsior but seems heavily restricted for the North Beach businesses.


(-)Joel Campos, Pagoda Theater


-
 
 This legislation would prevent restaurants from being opened in the North Beach.


(-)Ursula


-
 
 I'm opposed to the legislation for the North Beach not being able to serve alcohol in the restaurants.

SPEAKER(S):
 
 [In addition to the speaker listed below, other speakers include those listed on item 20.]


Saied Amin, Project Sponsor


-
 
 I got an extended permit about 10 years ago and if you take the permit away, my business will fail because the business is very slow.


-
 
 There is a lot of competition in the area and if you are revoking my permit, you should revoke it to all the businesses on that street so there would be no people on the street, meaning no businesses in the neighborhood.

 No Action is required of the Commission.

 [In addition to the speakers listed below, other speakers include those listed on item 19.]


(+)Carolyn Margit Ritchie


-
 
 As a member of the community, I support the permit extension.


(+)Karim Khelifi, Owner


-
 
 Our business is failing because we have to close at 2a.m. and many businesses in the area are open after hours. 
 
We are just trying to survive.


(+)Carl Hilsz


-
 
 I suggest you empower the Police Department to enforce the loitering policy. 
 
Stopping the service of food is not the optimal solution to reduce crime in the area.


(+)Stefano Cassolato


-
 
 The businesses are forced to depend on the revenues they get on the weekends to pay for their bills.


(+)Erick Arguello


-
 
 I support the extended hours because he has been a very responsible owner on 24
th
 Street.


(+)Khelifi, Owner


-
 
 
We really need your approval because our business is very slow during the day and staying open late on weekends would help us and the community by having patrons eat something after drinking.






(+)Nancy


-
 
 They have been in the 24
th
 Street Neighborhood for about 2 years and they have improved the area very much.
 
 We need these kinds of businesses in the North Beach.


(+)Terrance Alan, SF Late Night Coalition


-
 
 This the tail-end of a several year process that is actually working. 
 
The desire now is to encourage that success.

EASTERN NEIGHBORHOODS PROGRAM
- The Eastern Neighborhoods Program encompasses the Mission, Central Waterfront, East SoMa and Showplace Square/Potrero Hill. Planning staff, together with City Agency partners, will hold an 
informal discussion
 session with the Planning Commission to discuss and answer questions on the Final Public Review Draft Area Plans, which were released on December 1st.  This is a continuation of the session held on December 13, 2007.
 
 (This session is expected to last several hours and will include opportunities for public comment.)


Preliminary Recommendation:  No action requested (informational item)


 


SPEAKER(S)


Dan, Recreation and Park Department


-
 
 We have been working with the Planning Department staff over the pass year to review prospective sites for the Eastern Neighborhoods open space acquisition.


-
 
 We have identified around 5 - finding sources that could be available to us over the next few years as we move forward with implementation of the plan:
 
 Open Space Fund, Proposition C and 84, General Obligation Bond, and Impact Fees.
 
 In looking for maintenance we have been looking at alternate financing mechanisms.


Peter Albert, MTA


-
 
 We are on schedule to have the draft bicycle EIR this fall.


-
 
 The complicated process is just beginning to that point. 
 
Then we have to go through the appeal and the review of the comments.


-
 
 It is hard to predict when that would be ready. 
 
We are estimating that to happen in the summer of 2009.


-
 
 Early recommendations assessing a more efficient transportation system is coming up in the spring [of this year]


-
 
 Because we are one transportation agency, we are able to integrate bike, transit, pedestrian and traffic calming - putting the whole together in a comprehensive way.


Ariel Braunstein, North-Eastern Association


-
 
 
This plan is catastrophic for our diversity of people and economic growth.




Jay Goldman, South of Mission Neighborhood Coalition


-
 
 The increase of height on 24
th
 Street is going to encourage building demolitions.


Jenny McGrane


-
 
 I'm opposed to the rezoning of the Mission. 
 
This is unscrupulous.


Vicki Descalzo, South Mission Neighborhood Coalition


-
 
 The current proposal limits the future of the Mission.


Bhavik Vyas


-
 
 I oppose the rezoning plan because it is limiting the office space.


[No name stated]


-
 
 This ground plan would never happen in a PDR district. 
 
There is no excuse for any of this because we have already zoned the whole Bayshore and Bayview.


Jeana Snyder


-
 
 There is no need for this rezoning.


Lori Lusted, Howard Quinn Company


-
 
 The printing industry in San Francisco has declined in the last 5 years and there is no future for this type of industry with this rezoning.


Robert McCarthy, Gardens at Harrison


-
 
 This is the only block in the Eastern SoMa, north of the freeway, that is proposed for MUI.


Jim Allen


-
 
 The zoning description of UMU and PDR that is the proposed zoning needs to be clarified much more clearly that it is currently written.


Erick Arguello, Lower 24
th
 Street Merchants Association


-
 
 Requested that 24
th
 Street remains at its current zoning.


Jeff Fino


-
 
 Stores like Media Television Retail would not be able to be in the community. Creating companies and growing businesses should be encouraged to settle in these neighborhoods.


Brett Gladstone


-
 
 There is still a lot of work that needs to be done and there are many questions that you have made that are not answered yet.


Shawn


-
 
 Much burden is being put on developers of housing and commercial.
 
 The only financing source that has been identified is impact fees for affordable housing.


Fred Snyder


-
 
 Housing for middle income people is being overlooked.


Antie Kann


-
 
 I appreciate the work done so far but implementation of the plan and what really translated is really key.


Amy Sullivan, Rolph Park Neighborhood Group


-
 
 We need to really think what we are doing here because putting all affordable housing in one area is not right.


Andrew Dunbok


-
 
 This is not a wise plan; we have been working to have better neighborhoods but hundreds of coalitions are being unheard.


Lidia Fraser


-
 
 There has been a growth of diversity in the Mission naturally and it is not fair to have all affordable housing there.


Dwight Dolliver


-
 
 Stop this plan and put all the pieces adequately in every area in this City.


Mark Dambros


-
 
 
We are very happy with the plan in our area [8
th
 and Brannan Street] with the exception that we are looking for more flexibility on which floors above the ground floor can be used for office space.






Erin Rooney


-
 
 My restaurants are depending on the current mix of the residential community with the variety of businesses.
 
 This zoning legislation would allow the flexible use to continue.


[Inaudible]


-
 
 Glad to hear that we are recognizing 16
th
 Street as one of the key east-west corridors and it needs to be zoned NCT.


Gillian Gillette


-
 
 16
th
 Street should be zoned, as well as Valencia Street, for high density.


Dan Murphy


-
 
 This conversation would be a lot smoother if we start with a clear vision for specific areas and what we really want the City to look like.


Joe Boss


-
 
 The first thing to do is to figure out what is missing, lacking, broken, and/or nonexistent. 
 
The impact needs report was just finalized in December 2007 and we need more time.


Greg Miller


-
 
 Requested staff to revisit the East SoMa area plan with increasing heights for residential developments.


[Inaudible]


-
 
 Asked how to get more information and be involved in the process.


Glenn McNaulty


-
 
 This plan should not go forward until questions from Commissioners and the public are answered.


Elaine, 725 Harrison Street


-
 
 Asked the Commission to take another look at the zoning map and rezone the area to mixed use residential [4
th
 and Harrison Street]


Donna Kelincon


-
 
 Asked the Commission to not throw away the good things we've got in the neighborhood.


Josh Smith


-
 
 This plan needs to make economic sense and the definition of PDR should be expanded and made flexible to take technology into account.


Greg Markoulis


-
 
 The plan does not show any virtual retail on the entire stretch of 21
st
 to 23
rd
 Streets. 
 
The new zoning should have more retail to create more critical mass.


Sue Hestor


-
 
 We need to change the zoning and encourage affordable housing as well as keep businesses in the Mission and South of Market.


Pedro


-
 
 We would like to keep the diversity in the Mission in terms of having small businesses in the neighborhoods.


 


ACTION:
 
 No Action is required of the Commission.
 
 This is an informational item.
