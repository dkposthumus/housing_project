 Commission Comments/Questions

Future Meetings/Agendas
.
 
 At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.




 


Commissioner Antonini:


Cities in which the political conventions are being held this week – Denver and ST. Paul – have less national and international influence than does San Francisco, but they have facilities that can accommodate those large conventions.
 
 We have to look at this in terms of comprehensive planning and look at any future plans for expansion of the Convention Center.


Commissioner Miguel:


An article in the newsletter from SPEAK titled  A Place for People – Your Front Setbacks Can Be a Communal Zone. 
 
 In this area front setbacks are basically concrete regardless of the building code.
 
 It falls into a great deal of what we do here when we approve projects.
 


Commissioner Sugaya:


Aren't Institutional Master Plans limited to public institutions?
 
 Are they required for private schools?


Zoning Administrator responded:


No and yes, they are required for private schools.


Commissioner Sugaya:


I'm prompted to ask because of an article I cut out a long time ago with respect to expansion of University High School that has purchased 30,000 square feet on California Street as well as other schools that have purchased property for their expansion plans.
 
 I don't think we have seen many IMPs come forward from these institutions, or am I wrong?
 
 If they are on record, then that's fine.
 
 Also, there have been at least two articles about the Academy of Art University expansion into sports.
 
 I'd like the Enforcement section and Mr. Sanchez to look into that.


Commissioner Borden:


 
Following up on something Commissioner Antonini said:
 
 I was in Denver and one thing they don't have is public transit.
 
 The city is a nightmare to get around in.
 
 There was a great development that took place in San Diego called Market Great Partners.
 
 They did this process where the convened the community; did a series of charrette; and basically the donation of the land was to the community and for them to decide what was to go there.
 
 What was amazing is they offered for the first time initial public offerings for people in the community.
 
 They required that stock options be sold for $20.00 and everybody had to buy at least 20.
 
 The whole point was that it allowed people that lived in the community to be invested in the community.
 
 They went through an entire visioning process – we need a grocery store, we need this, we need that, etc. 
 
It is an amazing model of showing how you can have people who live in a community help revitalize that community, have ownership in that community and be part of its future.


Commissioner Lee:


 
Some of the developers are not getting the financing they need.
 
 Is there any new high rises breaking ground in 2009?
 
 To my surprise there aren't any, even the ones that are entitled because of the credit crunch.
 
 That concerns me because if we don't break ground in 2009, all the housing and development we have now will probably have to lay off all the workers.
 
 And on most of the high rises the workers are union workers.
 
 What I wand to find out from staff is is there a way we can track some of the approvals we've had in the last four or five years and find out where they are in the construction process?
 
 Second thing:
 
 Commissioner Antonini is correct and we are losing some of the big conventions to San Diego.
 
 San Diego has one contiguous convention center over one million square feet and in San Francisco, we have three 250,000 square feet of exhibit space.
 
 In Chicago, they have 1.7 million square feet of exhibit space.
 
 The Center is looking at how we maintain our competitiveness in the convention business.
 
 We are losing the international gift fail to Los Vegas now.
 
 They have 1.6 million square feet and the cost is less.
 
 Another idea I had in the last couple of weeks is why San Francisco can't have its own Section 8 housing.


Commissioner Moore:


You probably read this morning that the Mayor extended the timeline for the [
 
 ] Gardens from September 21 to November and I think that is a great idea.
 
 I'd like to create a policy discussion out of that as the importance of maintaining the size of the rear yard open space.
 
 I'd like to look at the importance of public open space and the redirecting of a more environmentally centered focus of how we live in the city.


Commissioner Olague:


On the 25 of September we are discussion sustainability.
 
 I think it would be important to discuss these types of issues during that hearing.
 
 Are we going to have a discussion about the Presidio in a timely way (prior to 10/4)?
 
 I want to piggyback off the comments of Commissioner Borden about the project in San Diego:
 
 We saw the first of the social economic analysis during the Eastern Neighborhoods process.
 
 There was a report from the Department of Public health on ENCHIA (Eastern Neighborhoods Community Health Impact Assessments).
 
 This is something that is a national trend and our Public Health Department has been working on this extensively so I think it is pioneering work that we have done here in relation to the Eastern Neighborhoods.
 
 How we are going to implement that into a planning effort is not really clear to me yet.
 
 But I think Bayview and Treasure Island are examples of how it would be interesting to see if they can use some of the tools that were created as a result of the work in the Eastern Neighborhoods and expand it to the work in these communities.
 
 Also, I received an email from someone in the community.
 
 I guess Cesar Chavez is undergoing a re-design.
 
 I guess the issue is the day labors program.
 
 I'd like a status report on that.


 


 


D.
 
 DIRECTOR'S REPORT


 


11.
 
 Director's Announcements


 


Director Rahaim:


We sent a letter to the Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District.
 
 We met with this panel twice and they are listed on that letter.
 
 The panel's recommendation is if there is any to do this with a more robust, non-physical program on the bridge that would be their first recommendation (on suicide prevention).
 
 Their preferred solution is the horizontal net that is placed about 20 feet below the surface of the sidewalk.
 
 There is pretty strong evidence from a couple of projects in Europe where such a net has actually prevented even the attempt because the physical presence of the net has prevented people from trying to jump.
 
 The second thing I wanted to mention is that we have started work on the update of the 2009 Housing Element.
 
 We have assembled a community advisory body and they had their first meeting this week.
 
 The State has required that the update be completed by July 1
st
 of next year.
 
 We have a three prong outreach strategy on this.
 
 One is the community advisory body.
 
 The second is what we are calling a stakeholder session series.
 
 These will be a number of focused working sessions for specific topics. 
 
The third is a larger set of city wide workshops where we would have broader neighborhood outreach.
 
 We believe that we can get this work done within the year.

Consideration of Adoption of CEQA Findings
. The 22,000 square foot project site is located at 178 Townsend Street, on the corner of Townsend Street and Clarence Place between Second Street and Third Street (Assessor's Block 3788, Lot 012).
 
 The site is zoned SLI (Service/Light Industrial), is in a 50-X Height and Bulk District, and is occupied by the California Electric Light Company Station B building, a Contributory Building within the South End Historic District. The proposed project involves conversion of the building from its current use as a valet parking garage to a mix of ground-floor retail and up to 85 housing units, with accessory off-street parking for the residential uses.
 
 The proposed uses would be housed in the existing building and a vertical addition, and would occupy 96,350 square feet (sf) of floor area, including 71,500 square feet in residential uses 1,050 square feet in retail uses, and 13,200 square feet of parking.
 
 The proposed vertical addition would be set back 40 feet from Townsend Street and would rise above the existing 23-to 42-foot tall roofline to a height of 50 feet.
 
 The proposed project also includes a one-level underground parking garage with 74 parking spaces in two-car stackers accessed from Clarence Place.
