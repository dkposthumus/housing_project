Request for Conditional Use Authorization
 pursuant to Section 209.6(b) of the Planning Code to legalize and operate a wireless telecommunication facility for Sprint/Nextel within the RC-4 (North of Market Residential Special Use District) and an 80-T Height and Bulk district, upon the roof of the approximately 210 foot high structure that contains 184 condominium dwelling units over ground story commercial space. As per the City and County of San Francisco's Wireless Telecommunication Services (WTS) Facilities Siting Guidelines, the proposal is a Preferred Location Preference 2, as it is the site of previously approved antenna installations
. The proposal is to legalize nine antennas at three different locations upon the roof of the approximately 210-foot high building. These antennas were previously installed without benefit of a permit or Conditional Use Authorization. Related equipment would be placed within an interior storage room on the twelfth floor. The subject site is within 300-foot radius of your property. This case is cross referenced with case number 
2005.0686C. (Mailed notices reference this 2005.0686C case tracking number only. This case can be referenced under either case number.)

Inquiries/Announcements
.
 
 Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).


Â·
 
 
Future Meetings/Agendas
.
 
 At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.


 


Commissioner Moore


-
 
 On the town meeting on land use and health, sponsored by the Department of Public Health, Director Rahaim was on the panel and it was an extremely important meeting on the nexus between health and urban development.


-
 
 Out of this six-part series, they screened the portion that 
place
 matters.
 
 It is really important for Commissioners as well the Planning Department to understand it.


-
 
 I would like to ask Director Rahaim to actually have staff review this document.


-
 
 In speaking with Dr. Battia, he made himself available to bring the power point to understand that data.


-
 
 In addition, one of the panel members was the Director of San Francisco Redevelopment, Mr. Fred Blackwell. 
 
He spoke about Hope San Francisco, a project in the Bayview.


-
 
 I strongly urge that Mr. Blackwell and perhaps with Doug Shoemaker report to this Commission on that particular project because it is relevant.


-
 
 Lastly, Commissioner Sugaya brought up a number of weeks ago, but there was no follow up about the Fisher Museum.
 
 It was suggested to call together the Planning Department, Commission, the Landmarks Board, and the Presidio Trust or involved agencies to come together to dialogue about this project.


-
 
 That discussion would be very helpful and I hope that Commissioners support that request.


Commissioner W. Lee


-
 
 Last week, I read the San Francisco Business Times about the ballot measure that Supervisor Duffty is sponsoring.
 
 He is considering it family friendly.


-
 
 I would like to ask our staff or the Supervisor's staff to give a briefing to the Planning Commission regarding the ballot measure itself and why/how it is family friendly.


Commissioner Olague


-
 
 
It has been requested already and Ms. [AnMarie] Rodgers is going to be working on that.


Commissioner Sugaya


-
 
 Echoed what Commissioner Moore said about the Presidio Trust and perhaps trying to get some kind of meeting with them.


-
 
 Secondly, I have an article here that talks about Los Angeles Department of City Planning and the system they are using there called Zoning Information and Net Access.


-
 
 Talks about things in the budget and I would like to pass this to our staff.


Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 I gave the Commissioners and some of the staff an article titled  The Myth of Middle Class Schools'.


-
 
 I think that the relevance of this is that we do a lot of things in zoning to try to keep families here and one of their big concerns is always schools.


-
 
 This particular article points out the achievement of public schools in some wealthy areas is not as high as they presume. 
 
In many cases the performances is better in urban districts.


-
 
 Secondly, 
 
in keeping businesses in San Francisco, we have payroll tax that has to be weighed in as we make decisions in regards to planning issues and zoning.


-
 
 We have to remember that there are many factors that determine whether a business stays in an area and certainly there are economic factors in addition to zoning considerations.


-
 
 Thirdly, I have been receiving a lot of e-mails from people who testified last week and brought in different perspectives on the Eastern Neighborhoods.


-
 
 I was not happy with the way they conducted themselves, but the message they brought was an interesting one.


-
 
 They have a perspective that I think is very important to hear because they were some of the pioneers in the area and expressed the fear of being threatened by a new plan.


-
 
 Ken Rich brings up some good points in his memorandum that he sent to the Commissioners.
 
 I think we need further dialogue, for sure.

 DIRECTOR'S REPORT

 Director's Announcements


 


John Rahaim, Director


-
 
 It might be useful to mention in light of all the e-mails that we have been receiving on the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan, but I just want to make some points of clarification on the plan.


-
 
 There were several issues raised and obviously one is the issue of affordable housing.


-
 
 In over 20 years there would be between 1 and 2 thousand new housing units built in the Mission as a whole and about 70 percent would be market rate.


-
 
 There is no provision in the proposed plan that would concentrate those in any one area.


-
 
 The 30 percent of units that would be affordable would be built as the projects are built.


-
 
 The other issue was about offices, residential and retail businesses.
 
 In the area that is often called the  blue zone' on the map, they would continue to permit anything that is permitted today except new residential developments.


-
 
 In the area called  orange zone,' it would be the same except that residential development would also be permitted.


-
 
 In both zones - office, retail and residential that was legally permitted before would essentially be grandfathered.
 
 This is not requiring anyone to close businesses or move out.


-
 
 There was a question about adult entertainment. 
 
In general, it is permitted in the northeast Mission and permitted with certain conditions on Mission Street.
 
 It is not permitted anywhere in the residential areas around Valencia Street.


-
 
 There are new conditions that are proposed for adult entertainment. 
 
In general, it is more restricted.


-
 
 Parking - as you know the proposed Eastern Neighborhoods Plan would remove parking minimums and replace it with parking maximums to address the issues of traffic and parking.


-
 
 There were a lot of questions raised about outreach. 
 
We can do more in terms of outreach but we have tried reaching the largest number of people as we can in this process.


Commissioner Olague


-
 
 There was also mentioned NCT, Neighborhood Commercial Transit, and I do not know if you can elaborate a little bit on that.


Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator


-
 
 As I understand it, an NCT is an NC-3 that would reduce parking requirements.

Amit Ghosh

In your packets for next week's hearing, there would be the housing inventory report that we annually publish.


-
 
 
If you desire, we can hold a presentation to you.
 
 It has information on the new housing that was produced in the calendar year of 2006.


-

Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator reported:


 


Board of Appeals


A.
124 – 128 Fillmore Street – Variance
 
to build a garage in the rear yard.
 
 There were allegations that the three units were being used as a Bed & Breakfast.
 
 I requested to the Department of Building Inspection that they suspend the permit.
 
 Last time there were two appeals: (a) next door neighbor appealing the issuance of building permit and (b) my suspension on the same permit because we had an illegal use on the site.
 
 
Denied the building permit
.
 
 They overruled the original permit and upheld our suspension.


B.
1266 Dolores Street
.
 
 Large demolition needing to keep part of the rear that is a non-conforming structure.
 
 They removed almost everything on the rear yard.
 
 We suspended the permit and the Board of Appeals 
upheld
 it and they said that they would need a variance.

 Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.


 


SPEAKER(S)


Paul Wermer [Re: 2040 Fillmore Street]


-
 
 I'm concerned about the policy on public notices. 
 
One project had a 312 notice for 20 days and your department responded that they are allowed to combine notification. 
 
They should be combined to the longest specified period.


-
 
 Project Sponsors willingly requested continuance to accommodate our schedule.


Patrick McCann [Academy of Arts University]


-
 
 Our attorney received the proposal yesterday stating that they are going to move the tenants out of the barn, which is opposing the 22-month moratorium that was introduced at the Board of Supervisors.


-
 
 It is very crucial that you address the Academy of Arts - Institutional Master Plan.


Sue Hestor [Academy of Arts University]


-
 
 They are planning to subdivide the place and they cannot do that without a permit.


-
 
 Everyday we receive insults and evasions of the law.

SPEAKER(S)


Tuija Catalano, Project Sponsor Represetantive


-
 
 This is the type of project that the City has been looking for. 
 
Its an urban, dense, infill project that utilizes an under utilized lot, maximizes housing density, and provides active ground floor neighborhood serving uses in a location that is exceptionally well served by transit.


-
 
 The project has many benefits. 
 
Among them is large family unit housing; the open space amenities far exceeding the code requirements; and it is in a very unique location.


Rick Cristiani, Architect


-
 
 [Power point presentation on the design]


-
 
 When we started the project; we met with staff and part of their concerns were to have a modern building to be contextual, articulated, and to provide a visual experience from different angles.


-
 
 And because it is at the corner of Sutter Street, they wanted a gateway or landmark type building in a prominent sense.


-
 
 This is the result of that process that we went through.
 
 We have not received negative responses.


-
 
 The project will succeed in being a landmark building adding to the Van Ness Corridor.


(+)Hanley Chan, San Francisco Patrol Special Police


-
 
 I am in support of the project because it has been an active participant with our community policing program and they would be a great asset for the neighborhood.


(+)Deborah Granelli


-
 
 Spoke in support of the project.


(+)Robert


-
 
 This project is bringing excitement to this corridor because it would make a great impact by bringing useful businesses and people to live in our neighborhood and increasing foot traffic.


(+)Marlayne Morgan


-
 
 This is a fabulous example of a sponsor and developer who actually pay attention to the height, density, and use.


(-)Stephen Bertram


-
 
 I'm concerned about traffic, parking, and the height. 
 
It is out of scale.


(+)Maryland Pont


-
 
 We conducted approximately 10 to 12 community meetings with many associations and organizations in the neighborhood.


-
 
 The building design and the development in general have been well received and we have not had any negative comments regarding the development.


-
 
 Submitted letters of support.

Public Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Report
.
 
 The 22,000 square foot project site is located at 178 Townsend Street, on the corner of Townsend Street and Clarence Place between Second Street and Third Street (Assessor's Block 3788, Lot 012).
 
 The site is zoned SLI (Service/Light Industrial), is in a 50-X Height and Bulk District, and is occupied by the California Electric Light Company Station B building, a Contributory Building within the South End Historic District. The proposed project involves conversion of the building from its current use as a valet parking garage to a mix of ground-floor retail and up to 85 housing units, with accessory off-street parking for the residential uses.
 
 The proposed uses would be housed in the existing building and a vertical addition, and would occupy 96,350 square feet (sf) of floor area, including 71,500 sf in residential uses,1,050 sf in retail uses, and 13,200 sf of parking.
 
 The proposed vertical addition would be set back 40 feet from Townsend Street and would rise above the existing 23 to 42-foot tall roofline to a height of 50 feet.
 
 The proposed project also includes a one-level underground parking garage with 74 parking spaces in two-car stackers accessed from Clarence Place.
 
 The Draft EIR was released December 22, 2007.
 


Preliminary Recommendation: No Action Required


Note: Written comments will be accepted at the Planning Department's offices until the close of business on February 5, 2008.


 


SPEAKER(S)

Review under Planning Code Section 295
 of a proposed addition of approximately 76,500 square feet in six stories to an existing 13-story office building with an additional 1,530 square feet of new ground-floor retail space, requiring exceptions to Planning Code standards for off-street freight loading, building bulk and shadowing of public parks - in a C-3-O (Downtown Office) District and a 350-S Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Find that the new shadow cast is not adverse.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of January 24, 2008)


 


SPEAKER(S)


(-)Elaine Anderson, Vice-President for Boston Properties


-
 
 For the last three months, we have been trying to get information from the sponsor on exactly how much shadow would be cast along the Embarcadero Center.
 
 We just received it this morning.


-
 
 The information was not provided with enough time for the public and the Commission to review. 
 
This item should be continued.


Andrew Junius, Project Sponsor


-
 
 
This is a very small building in a large lot giving us a unique opportunity.


-
 
 
Both the vertical and retail elements of the addition, as well as some very nice plaza upgrades make this a great project and we hope you will like it.


Steve Worhtington, Architect


-
 
 
[power point presentation on the design]


-
 
 
Existing conditions at the site along California Street are in need of repair.


-
 
 
The addition extends the internal retail connecting it right out to the public right-of-way.


-
 
 
The plaza has to be redone to have water. 
 
It will be framed at the corner as well as one angel on California Street and locating the main entrance right into the center of the plaza.


-
 
 
The vertical addition is unique in shape and has been sculpted to conform to the guidelines that address casting of shadows on public rights-of-way.

 Found the new shadow to have no adverse impact

SPEAKER(S)


Jeffrey Leibovitz


Re: Eastern Neighborhoods


-
 
 
It appears like there is disconnection with the Office of Economic Development and the Mayor's Office of Housing in understanding the process that is taking place and some of the controls we are trying to establish.


-
 
 
The Mayor's Office of Housing needs to come out and explain what the intent is in terms of the housing overlay.


Re: Harrison Gardens


-
 
 I think Commissioner W. Lee will need to excuse himself when this project comes to this Commission because he is already predisposed to supporting it.
