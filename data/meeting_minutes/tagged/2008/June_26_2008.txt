EASTERN NEIGHBORHOODS PROGRAM
-


Hearing #6 - June 26, 2008 - (Commission workshop & public comment)


Staff will begin a discussion with the Commission on direction from Commissioners regarding potential changes to the Eastern Neighborhoods Initiation Package, including Planning Code Amendments, Zoning Map Amendments, General Plan Amendments, Historic Preservation Interim Procedures, and the Implementation Program.
 


The Commission may also discuss any and all other subjects related to the Eastern Neighborhoods Program.


Preliminary Recommendation:  Informational Presentation and Public Comment.  No Commission Action requested at the June 26  hearing.


The Planning Commission will hold a series of public hearings beginning on May 15, 2008 to consider Case No. 2004.0160EMTUZUU, and would include adopting a Motion to certify the Final Environmental Impact Report and adopt CEQA Findings and consider resolutions to approve amendments to the San Francisco General Plan, Planning Code and Zoning Map and resolutions to approve Historic Resources Interim Procedures and Public Benefits Program and Monitoring Procedures related to the four Eastern Neighborhoods Area Plans - the Mission, Showplace Square/Potrero Hill, Central Waterfront and East SoMa Area Plans.   Hearings are currently scheduled for May 15, 2008, June 5, 2008, June 12, 2008, June 19 2008, June 26 2008, July 3 2008, July 10 2008.  The Commission will consider and receive public comment on specific aspects of the Plans and proposed amendments at each hearing.  The series of hearings will culminate in a public hearing to consider adoption actions on or after July 10, 2008.


The project encompasses a significant proportion of the San Francisco land area in the southeast quadrant of the City, encompassing:

" East SoMa (the eastern portion of the South of Market district), bounded generally by Folsom Street on the northwest, the Rincon Hill Plan area (essentially, Second Street) on the east, Townsend Street on the south, and Fourth Street on the west, with an extension to the northwest bounded by Harrison, Seventh, Mission, Sixth (both sides), Natoma, Fifth, and Folsom Streets;

" the Mission, bounded by 13th and Division Streets on the north, Potrero Avenue on the east, CÃ©sar ChÃ¡vez Street on the south, and Guerrero Street on the west;

" the Showplace Square/Potrero Hill district, generally bounded by Bryant Street and 10th Street on the northwest, Seventh Street on the northeast, Interstate Highway 280 (I-280) on the east, 25th and 26th Streets on the south, and Potrero Avenue on the west; and

" the Central Waterfront, bounded by Mariposa Street on the north, San Francisco Bay on the east, Islais Creek on the south, and I-280 on the west.

  The project Areas are comprised of the entirety or portions of 437 Assessor's Blocks.

Specifically, on or after June 19, 2008, the Commission will consider the following actions:


" Case 2004.0160E - Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report and adoption of CEQA Findings on the Eastern Neighborhoods Area Plans.


" Case 2004.0160M - Adopt General Plan amendments that would, 1) add to the General Plan four new area plans (the "Eastern Neighborhoods Area Plans"), which include the Mission, East SoMa, Showplace Square/Potrero Hill and Central Waterfront Area Plans; and 2) also make related amendments to the following portions of the existing General Plan: the Commerce and Industry Element, Recreation Element, Open Space Element, the South of Market Area Plan, the Central Waterfront Area Plan, the Northeastern Waterfront Area Plan, and the Land Use Index;


" Case 2004.0160T - Adopt Planning Code text amendments that would revise Planning Code controls, including, but not limited to controls for land use, height and bulk, building design, density, open space, and parking; establish 13 new zoning districts; amend the South Park District; RTO District, NCT Districts, and Downtown Residential Districts; and make related revisions to the Planning Code necessary to implement the General Plan as proposed to be amended and make related Planning Code Amendments pursuant to the Eastern Neighborhoods Area Plans.


" Case 2004.0160Z - Adopt Zoning Map amendments that would revise the Zoning Maps of the City and County of San Francisco. Proposed Planning Code map amendments would a) update height and bulk districts, b) apply the RTO District and PDR-2 Districts in the Eastern Neighborhoods, and c) establish 13 new zoning districts.


" Case 2004.0160U - Adopt Interim Historic Preservation procedures that would establish interim procedures for additional review of proposed changes to or demolition of historic or potentially historic resources in the Eastern Neighborhoods, pending completion of the ongoing historic resource surveys.


" Case 2004.0160UU - Adopt Monitoring and Review Procedures in order to review development activity and progress towards the Eastern Neighborhoods implementation measures.


SPEAKER(S)


Brett Gladstone


-
 
 I sent you an 8 foot long map of 16
th
 Street showing you where there is PDR and UMU.


-
 
 You may have noticed that there are 5 buildings with frontages of 200 feet. 
 
The allowance of 4,000 square feet per lot for retail is much better than the 2,500 previously proposed, but it means that you may only have 40 feet of a 200 foot frontage. 
 
That occurs five times in that area with retail. 
 
Retails want to be with retails.


-
 
 I would suggest that there be a prevision that at every 65 feet, retail above 4,000 be allowed to make that a continuous long area [along 16
th
 Street]


Judy West


-
 
 Greatly concerned about what to do with non-conforming uses since there is no evidence of how many uses are going to be created in the proposed zoning.


-
 
 Why is the area around Franklin Park proposed to be zoned PDR?


Mark D'Ambrosi


-
 
 Requested change to the language in the plan to allow office space above the first floor PDR use rather than above the ground floor [Bryant and Brannan Streets]


-
 
 Requested the same height limit that is proposed on Brannan Street to be on Bryant Street as well - 65 feet.


Juan Calaf


-
 
 From our analysis, it appears that full consideration has been given to South Park to maintain relatively low heights in the area thereby preserving its character while at the same time the height increases in the SOMC area would likely shade out most of the existing residential.


Diana Wu


-
 
 The proposed height increases in the SOMC area and along many of the other areas will have significant environment impacts for residents as well as businesses.


-
 
 Requested to maintain environmental impact review process and procedures because it is very important for all of us.


Sal Gonzales


-
 
 
Appreciated the 65 foot height recommendation for 24
th
 and Harrison Streets.


-
 
 
We own two parcels at that corner and we are requesting them to be zoned NCT.


Sarah Murray


-
 
 
Concerned with the recommendation to not allow any residential uses along 16
th
 Street. 
 
We do not want to loose services that are existent in the neighborhood.


David Solis


-
 
 
It does not make sense to change zoning in a neighborhood that is already established [Dog-patch] and I'm requesting that you change the proposed zoning to UMU.


Steve Vettel


-
 
 
We had suggested that in the innovative office district, where the American industries are, there could be either 2,500 square feet per parcel or up to .25 FRA, whichever got you the greater number.


-
 
 
It is particularly important on Third Street because it is a transit corridor like 16
th
 Street.
 
 Those industrial buildings along Third Street do not really function as industrial and it would make more sense that in some of those buildings to have some retail.


-
 
 
In the PDR-1-D-district in Show Place Square, art schools are permitted and student housing use in conjunction with those schools should also be permitted.


Kepa


-
 
 I am wondering how the department is planning to address the reality of transit at Showplace Square/Potrero Hill because it is essentially nothing in terms of public transportation.


Tony Kelly


-
 
 The point of student housing in the PDR-1 districts: 
 
things that can support the culture of arts would be terrific.


-
 
 I do not think that the current proposal about personal services and gymnasiums really solves the issues.


[Inaudible]


-
 
 My neighborhood is basically built out and there is construction going on that is making a lot of noise.


-
 
 The only little green space is in the Mission and that has been taken over by dogs.


Sue Hestor


-
 
 We need to have sidewalk standards and they need to be imposed. 
 
Areas like 16
th
 Street really need street lighting. 
 
As a Planning Department you should be able to ask other departments to do something about it.


-
 
 Non conforming uses, letters of determination do not involve the public and it should.


Joe Boss


-
 
 The gymnasiums should have some kind of portability of at least three blocks because they get bigger over the years and we do not want to have empty lots.


Datoan Thropp


-
 
 I am really happy that some improvements are being made especially along 16
th
 Street. 
 
But I am also urging you to consider some controls on residential in the PDR districts.


Fred Snyder


-
 
 16
th
 Street is a mayor transit corridor and we need to do more along those streets if you are making more housing available there.


Greg Miller


-
 
 For grocery stores, it might be good to have some sort of process like CU and it may be worthy of consideration to try to fast track grocery store CU's so they do not get stuck in the process for two years because they are absolutely essential to families in the City.


Scott Thiper


-
 
 Requested to have another community meeting between owners, the Eastern SoMa Plan, the Western SoMa Plan and MEDA to work on the interpretation for PDR.


Bob Mayers


-
 
 The plan is to down zone larger areas for PDR, but no one as yet has been able to give any examples of the new PDR moving into these areas. 
 
PDR users are not moving in, they are only moving out [Dog-patch]


Jean Snyder


-
 
 Echoed the previous speaker's request to not down zone the PDR and keep what is already in place. 
 
We need to have compatibility.
