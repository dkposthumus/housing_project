A
ppeal of Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration.
 
 The proposed project would include demolition of the existing paved parking lot which covers the 11,020 square foot site, a 222 square foot office shed, formerly a used car sales office, and a billboard sign extending above the west side of the site and construction of a five-story, mixed use building with 4,917 square feet of ground floor retail and 36 dwelling units.
 
 The building would contain 12 one-bedroom units and 24 two-bedroom units, of which four (4) are required to be below market rate.
 
 The application was filed prior to the March 23, 2006 date within the Planning Code that triggers an increase in the required percentage of below market units from 12 percent to 15 percent.
 
 The applicant proposes a total of 36 motorized vehicle parking spaces accessed via Stevenson Street, only thirty of which are permitted with a use permit under recently enacted Market-Octavia Plan and zoning controls.
 
 Ground floor retail would be divided into three spaces ranging from 1,479 square feet to 1,958 square feet and would be accessed via Valencia Street, 14th Street and the corner where these two streets intersect.
 
 Bicycle parking for 18 bicycles would be provided in the garage and accessible through the lobby.
 
 The project sponsor would seek approval from the SFMTA for one on-street loading space to be located adjacent to the elevator along 14th Street which could accommodate a service van or a small truck. No on-site freight or delivery spaces are proposed.

CENTRAL SUBWAY PROJECT

Certification of the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Report
 
prepared for Central Subway which is Phase 2 of the Third Street Light Rail project.
 
 (The environmental document has been prepared to meet the requirements of both CEQA and NEPA and analyzes updated information from the original EIS/EIR that was certified in 1998.)
 
 The proposed project is to provide Muni Metro rail service from 4th and King (current terminus of Phase 1-the T-Third line) to Chinatown in a mostly subway configuration. The proposed alignment would operate on Fourth and Stockton Streets with a deep underground crossing of Market Street. The alignment would be on the surface of Fourth Street beginning at King Street and go underground between Bryant and Harrison (under the I-80 freeway). There would be a surface station at 4
th
 and Brannan Streets and three underground stations at Moscone, Union Square/Market, and Chinatown.


Preliminary Recommendation:  Certify the Environmental Impact Report


Please note: The public hearing on the Draft EIR is closed. The public comment period for the Draft EIR ended on December 10, 2007. The Planning Commission does not conduct public review of Final EIRs. Public comments on the certification may be presented to the Planning Commission during the Public Comment portion of the Commission calendar.

Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 Recently Supervisor Daly raised the issue of Market Street and possible consideration of banning the vehicle traffic on the street; I am not sure that I necessarily agree with that concept.


-
 
 I think that the idea he has raised is a good one because it is a street that I travel every day either by public transportation or automobile and there are some solutions needed in terms of separating bicyclists from autos in a more safe matter and perhaps discouraging some traffic that is not necessary.


-
 
 I think we are done some of that already because there are no left turns allowed between Gough and Drumm, I believe.


-
 
 It is an issue that I think we all share because it is a major artery in San Francisco and it is in the process of revitalization.


-
 
 We want to make sure that whatever is done, it does not discourage this process and jeopardize businesses along the way.


Commissioner Miguel


-
 
 It has come to my attention from a number of neighborhood groups that the Planning Department has given permission to AT&T to install somewhere around 850 of what is called lights deed metal cabinets on the sidewalks around the City and to enlarge some of the existent electrical boxes.


-
 
 If my information is correct, the new cabinets measure somewhere around 4' high, 4'2  wide and 26 deep; they will be installed within 100 feet of existent boxes.


-
 
 Some of the enlargement of the existent boxes would make them from 4'10  wide by 5'5  high and 26  deep which is nearly the size of a small pick-up track.


-
 
 They are starting neighborhood by neighborhood and some has been designated already.


-
 
 I had been informed that this department gave AT&T an exemption from environmental review.


-
 
 And beyond anything else; there has been absolutely no information, notification or discussion with any neighborhood organization in the entire City.


-
 
 I do not think this is the right way to proceed on something of this massive.


Commissioner Sugaya


-
 
 I would like to make a small suggestion for Director Rahaim regarding the Draft Action Plan that perhaps in reporting back on the status of these various projects, you can use a similar matrix indicating what the status is next to what is currently predicted of the timeframe.


-
 
 Each time we get a report we can have a little update along the site or something like that.
 
 I particularly liked the way it was presented.


-
 
 Commissioner Lee is always reminding us that tourism is one of the largest, if not the largest, industry in the City.
 
 I would like to re-enforce that a little bit.


-
 
 Travel and Leisure Magazine has the best awards every year and in 2007 San Francisco was rated the 9
th
 of most popular tourist destination in the entire world.
 
 This year failed to 10
th
.


-
 
 The only other North American city on the top 10 was New York and they were somewhere on the top 5.


-
 
 It just speaks to the popularity of the cities throughout the world and not just here in the United States.


-
 
 With all the discussions going on with respect to the Golden Gate Bridge barrier, I think I read that the Mayor Newsom has asked Director Rahaim to be involved in any kind of design review or design suggestions.


-
 
 If that could be at some point vented before the Commission, I would appreciate that.


Commissioner Lee


-
 
 I just wanted to let you know that there is a small business located in the Fillmore owned by Mr. Kirk Silvers, small business owner, home grown and he had a retail store.


-
 
 He moved to Sutter Street and now he is going out of business.


-
 
 I asked him if he would not mind to appear in front of Small Business Commission because he has a lot to say about how the City is treating small businesses.


-
 
 We all agree that small businesses are the future of San Francisco but yet, he feels that given the tax structure, cost of gas and electric, and the increase of inflation he can no longer make any money in San Francisco.


-
 
 Another home grown business that has done well for at least 15 years and he is actually being forced out of the market.


-
 
 I do not know what we can do to help small business but the more that I talk to small businesses I share some of their concerns.


Commissioner Moore


-
 
 I want to pick up one more time our discussion of last week, or the week before, about the size of ATMs as a piece of machine as 32x36 , standard dimensions.
 
 The recent signs of ATMs has gone up to 61/2 x 8'2 .


-
 
 The latest thing I realized is that the most current lending wages are also being posted there.


-
 
 I consider that as advertising that is not enclosure for ATMs.


-
 
 I would like us to look at our sign ordinance whether or not ATMs indeed fall under that category, at least new enhance ATMs.


Commissioner Sugaya


-
 
 After hearing the informational presentation by The Presidio Trust and the testimony accompanying that; we were not really in a position to take any position.


-
 
 I do not know if the Commission is interested on taking a jointly position or not but it might be good to consider scheduling a hearing at some point.


Commissioner Olague


-
 
 I think we should schedule a time on The Presidion again on August 7
th
 or 17
th
 to have some kind of statement regarding that.


-
 
 The Bike Plan, I received several calls about that and we might be requesting regular updates.


-
 
 I believe there was a meeting or hearing on congestion pricing and I was wondering if staff has heard about that.


-
 
 I know we were planning to have some green meetings and maybe then we can discuss that a little bit.


Commissioner Miguel


-
 
 We heard yesterday that the head of DBI left the City. 
 
Director Rahaim, do you have any idea who, at least temporarily, will take that position?


Director Rahaim


-
 
 My understanding is that is still to be decided since the decision was just made the last two days and the Mayor's Office has not yet decided it


Commissioner Olague


-
 
 The Arts Commission would be interesting to come here and give us an overview of their role.


-
 
 They relatively have a new director and some interesting things go on at that Commission and it would be good to have periodic reports here.


Director Rahaim


-
 
 I met with him recently and we are trying to connect with their staff on a number of planning projects.


-
 
 I am sure he will be happy to come to the Commission.

 DIRECTOR'S REPORT


 


16.
 
 Director's Announcements


 


Director Rahaim


-
 
 On the AT&T boxes; my understanding is that because of Federal Communication Laws, we are not permitted to control the actual box itself and only where the box breaks into the ground.


-
 
 The CEQA decision was based on the actual excavation for the boxes.
 
 That decision has been appealed and there is a hearing at the Board on Tuesday.


-
 
 A couple of other things, I did intend to tell you about the Bike Plan EIR and the hearing that happened last week.


-
 
 As you know, there were a lot of concerns raised by the Bicycle Advocate Community on some delays to the Bike Plan EIR and Supervisor Sandoval asked for a hearing which occurred last week at the Land Use Committee.


-
 
 The Bike Plan EIR is an exceptional complicated document because it is a citywide plan as well as environmental review that would clear sixty individual projects, very unusual in its scope.


-
 
 I have committed that we will complete the EIR by Thanksgiving.


-
 
 We have committed to additional staff and consultants resources to focus on the plan and we have also committed to monthly briefing to the Planning Commission and the MTA Board.


-
 
 I am very please to say that Harold Rojans, MTA, is going to be managing the overall process between the two agencies.


-
 
 With all of these measurements, we feel very confident that we can meet the schedule that the Draft would be issues by Thanksgiving and that the final will come out as we originally calendared for Spring or earlier Summer next year.


-
 
 Commissioner Sugaya asked about the Golden Gate Bridge.
 
 The Mayor has asked me to assemble a team, essentially outside advisors, to advise the proposed suicide barrier on the bridge.


-
 
 That EIR is out for public comments right now and it is due on August 25
th
.


-
 
 I am in the process of requesting the involvement of several local architects, engineers and artists to seat on a panel for probably a couple of meetings to review some of the technical issues.


-
 
 I will be happy to report on the findings of that group at this Commission.

 Turk and Taylor Streets has been labeled as a trouble hot spot in terms of crime, drugs sales and drug abuse but yet, a small shop selling paraphernalia was allowed to open up at 64 Turk Street.


-
 
 The owner was amicable enough to remove the paraphernalia and the signs after talking to him.


-
 
 We all can benefit from an ordinance to require a conditional use for these types of stores.


Chris Schulman


-
 
 We really need zoning controls for these shops because they handle low drug dealing.

(Continued from Regular Meeting of July 17, 2008)


 


SPEAKER(S)


Marcia Garland, Project Sponsor Representative


-
 
 There are about 370 signatures on a petition supporting the project and many of those signatures are people who are the competition.


-
 
 One of the problems with the space is its triangle shape limiting the tables and chairs that can be put into the space.


-
 
 North Beach is still a viable and wonderful neighborhood thanked to people like Alesandro and Fabricio [restaurant owners.]


(-)Nan Roth, Telegraph Hill Dwellers


-
 
 The entire Columbus frontage is occupied by restaurants with the exception of a small front being considered today for conversion from retail to occupancy by a restaurant.


-
 
 The most important thing is to protect the few remaining sites currently permitted for retail.


(-)Joan Wood, Telegraph Hill Dwellers


-
 
 With this establishment there, we would loose another store previously occupied by a neighborhood retail business.


-
 
 We will see 100% of the West side of this block occupied by eating/drinking establishments along with 60% of the establishments within one block ratio.


(+)Joe Alioto


-
 
 I encourage you to support the project, visit the restaurant and help foster exactly what it is that my people brings to this county.


(+)Julio Ramos


-
 
 As a big soccer fan, there is no better place to go watch an Italian national soccer team game than Panta Rei because it is a vibrant community that goes out to watch those games.


(+)Lynn Jefferson, North Beach Neighbors


-
 
 Supported the project and their efforts and urged the Commission to take a look of what is happening in the North Beach.


(+)Stefano Cassolato


-
 
 Supported the project because it is an expansion of a successful existent restaurant that is friendly, enthusiastic, has provided good food and fun dining experience for residents and tourists.


(+)Martin Kirkwood


-
 
 Urged to vote approving this project because they have been very successful, responsible neighbor and business owners.


-
 
 I would really like to see that the Planning Department supports economic vitality in the neighborhood.


(+)Ali Kia Shabahangi


-
 
 Supported the project because of their spirit to expand and the spirit that these Italian gentlemen bring to our communities.


(+)Felix Santos


-
 
 I am the previous business owner at that site and left because I did not have any business/customers there.


(+)Fergus O'Sullivan


-
 
 Supported the restaurant because this is an area for tourists and this restaurant has proven to have a tide record.


(+)Bernard Stalder


-
 
 The previous tenant could not afford the rent and retails would not be able to survive there.


(+)Helena Laudati


-
 
 We are immigrants trying to make a living and working really hard to success in the businesses.


-
 
 They are good landlords, neighbors and they are friends for everybody.


(+)Ali Hamidi


-
 
 The ratio balance of restaurant and retail relies on a guideline on the general plan but has never been codified.


-
 
 Supported the project because North Beach has an ethnic fabric and we would like to keep it that way.


(+)Anthony Azzollini


-
 
 We want businesses like this to grow because they have been an asset to this neighborhood.


(+)Daniel Fine


-
 
 I am in support of Panta Rei because I am very happy to have a little Italy like this and a place to go to with a vibrant spirit.

Request for Conditional Use Authorization
 to allow the demolition of dwelling units at the second and third stories pursuant to Planning Code Section 725.39 requiring Conditional Use authorization for residential demolition at the second story or higher.
 
 The proposal is to demolish an existing three-story, two-unit building and to construct a four-story, six-unit residential building in the Union Street Neighborhood Commercial District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Approve with Conditions


 


SPEAKER(S) on the consideration for continuance


Steven Silverman


-
 
 Opposed to the request of continuance because after a year long of communications the project sponsor just hired a lawyer.


Barbara Hayman


-
 
 Supported the continuance.


 


The Commission decided to hear this item as calendared


 


SPEAKER(S)


David Silverman, Project Sponsor Representative


-
 
 We are seeking a conditional use for six units of which one unit will be occupied by the owner and the other remaining five units will be rentals.


-
 
 The current building has no affordable units.


-
 
 Because the project is more than five units, in-lieu fee will be paid to the affordable housing fund for the purpose of increasing affordable housing in San Francisco.


-
 
 We have worked with the Planning Department for over a year to scope the project to reduce and minimize any impacts on neighbors.


Jonas, Architect


-
 
 We have increased setbacks beyond the Planning Code requirements to reduce impacts on the neighbor light and air access.


-
 
 We agreed on making the parking sub-grade.


-
 
 At the fourth floor, we provided additional 15 foot setbacks from the street faÃ§ade reducing the scale on Union Street and matching the height of the neighbor.


-
 
 The project is bringing six units with parking spaces and we believe is fully code compliance.


(+)Dee Altick


-
 
 Supported the project because it provides parking but would like that during construction they have some rat controls/extermination.


(-)Barbara Hamann


-
 
 This is a massive intrusion that would affect air flow, sunlight and it will barricade us into a box impacting property value.


(-)Elizabeth Erhardt


-
 
 The proposed project is not consistent with the master plan that fosters creation of family housing. 
 
1 bedroom residential is not family housing.


(-)Marco Croppi


-
 
 Concerned that the project would take away his mother's enjoyment of the yard by blocking sunlight.


(-)Maria Croppi
 
[Translated by Marco Croppi]


-
 
 Concerned that the project is taking away natural light and all I am asking for is further setbacks.


David Hansen

SPEAKER(S)


David Sincata, Project Sponsor Representative


-
 
 This conditional use would allow the school to continue to operate, as it has been for decades, in the neighborhood.


-
 
 The school is in the mix of doing $2.6 million on Code upgrade, seismic improvements, ADA accessibility, and Fire Code Provisions.


-
 
 This building is intended to be mainly use for offices and the library.


-
 
 The conditional use that approved this school at this location back in 1993 allowed up to 350 students and we do not intend to exceed that number.

 This conditional use is going to provide supported housing for elders and not a medical facility.

 Neighbors are worried about parking but most elders do not drive.


(-)Jon Hayward


-
 
 Opposed to this project for the increase in traffic on Girard Street.


-
 
 San Bruno Avenue, a parallel commercial street, is congested consistently and cars use Girard Street.


(-)John Perez


-
 
 In speaking with my neighbors; I believe that there is no one on this block that supports this project because of traffic and parking issues.


(+)Marjorie Cuitti


-
 
 I believe that San Francisco needs more homes for elders that are quality homes with safe environment and affordable rates.


(+)James Wu, Administrator


-
 
 This is not a hospital but a home for elders.


-
 
 Caregivers are often from the neighborhood taking public transportation or walk and unfortunately visitors are fairly rare.


(-)William Tran [translated by David]


-
 
 Opposed to this project because it would increase traffic with the caregivers, deliveries and service to doctor's appointments when they get sick.


(+)Rodney Hurd


-
 
 Shared experience of having his mother-in-law in a facility similar to the one proposed and only about 15 – 20% that live there have visitors on a regular monthly basis.

 San Francisco needs to respond to elder care and we need to fill in the middle between a nursing care facility and people living at homes with some assistance.

EASTERN NEIGHBORHOODS PROGRAM -


Hearing #9 - July 24, 2008 - (Commission workshop & public comment)


Staff will continue a discussion with the Commission on direction from the Commissioners regarding potential changes to the Eastern Neighborhoods Initiation Package, including Planning Code Amendments, Zoning Map Amendments, General Plan Amendments, Historic Preservation Interim Procedures, and the Implementation Program.
 


 


The Commission may also discuss any and all other subjects related to the Eastern Neighborhoods Program.


Preliminary Recommendation:  Informational Presentation and Public Comment;  No Commission Action requested at the July 24 hearing.


The Planning Commission will hold a series of public hearings beginning on May 15, 2008 to consider Case No. 2004.0160EMTUZUU, and would include adopting a Motion to certify the Final Environmental Impact Report and adopt CEQA Findings and consider resolutions to approve amendments to the San Francisco General Plan, Planning Code and Zoning Map and resolutions to approve Historic Resources Interim Procedures and Public Benefits Program and Monitoring Procedures related to the four Eastern Neighborhoods Area Plans - the Mission, Showplace Square/Potrero Hill, Central Waterfront and East SoMa Area Plans.   Hearings are currently scheduled for May 15, 2008, June 5, 2008, June 12, 2008, June 19 2008, June 26 2008, July 3 2008, July 10 2008, July 24, 2008.  The Commission will consider and receive public comment on specific aspects of the Plans and proposed amendments at each hearing.  The series of hearings will culminate in a public hearing to consider adoption actions after July 24, 2008.


The project encompasses a significant proportion of the San Francisco land area in the southeast quadrant of the City, encompassing:

" East SoMa (the eastern portion of the South of Market district), bounded generally by Folsom Street on the northwest, the Rincon Hill Plan area (essentially, Second Street) on the east, Townsend Street on the south, and Fourth Street on the west, with an extension to the northwest bounded by Harrison, Seventh, Mission, Sixth (both sides), Natoma, Fifth, and Folsom Streets;



" the Mission, bounded by 13th and Division Streets on the north, Potrero Avenue on the east, CÃ©sar ChÃ¡vez Street on the south, and Guerrero Street on the west;



" the Showplace Square/Potrero Hill district, generally bounded by Bryant Street and 10th Street on the northwest, Seventh Street on the northeast, Interstate Highway 280 (I-280) on the east, 25th and 26th Streets on the south, and Potrero Avenue on the west; and



" the Central Waterfront, bounded by Mariposa Street on the north, San Francisco Bay on the east, Islais Creek on the south, and I-280 on the west.

  The project Areas are comprised of the entirety or portions of 437 Assessor's Blocks.

Specifically, on or after July 24, 2008, the Commission will consider the following actions:


" Case 2004.0160E - Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report and adoption of CEQA Findings on the Eastern Neighborhoods Area Plans.


" Case 2004.0160M - Adopt General Plan amendments that would, 1) add to the General Plan four new area plans (the "Eastern Neighborhoods Area Plans"), which include the Mission, East SoMa, Showplace Square/Potrero Hill and Central Waterfront Area Plans; and 2) also make related amendments to the following portions of the existing General Plan: the Commerce and Industry Element, Recreation Element, Open Space Element, the South of Market Area Plan, the Central Waterfront Area Plan, the Northeastern Waterfront Area Plan, and the Land Use Index;


" Case 2004.0160T - Adopt Planning Code text amendments that would revise Planning Code controls, including, but not limited to controls for land use, height and bulk, building design, density, open space, and parking; establish 13 new zoning districts; amend the South Park District; RTO District, NCT Districts, and Downtown Residential Districts; and make related revisions to the Planning Code necessary to implement the General Plan as proposed to be amended and make related Planning Code Amendments pursuant to the Eastern Neighborhoods Area Plans.


" Case 2004.0160Z - Adopt Zoning Map amendments that would revise the Zoning Maps of the City and County of San Francisco. Proposed Planning Code map amendments would a) update height and bulk districts, b) apply the RTO District and PDR-2 Districts in the Eastern Neighborhoods, and c) establish 13 new zoning districts.


" Case 2004.0160U - Adopt Interim Historic Preservation procedures that would establish interim procedures for additional review of proposed changes to or demolition of historic or potentially historic resources in the Eastern Neighborhoods, pending completion of the ongoing historic resource surveys.


" Case 2004.0160UU - Adopt Monitoring and Review Procedures in order to review development activity and progress towards the Eastern Neighborhoods implementation measures.


 


SPEAKER(S)


Debra Walker


-
 
 I noticed that in the North East Mission there were people that were seemingly on opposite side and have different complaints about this proposal that actually ended up by really understanding some of the issues and conflicts with the intent to preserve the PDR uses.


-
 
 There are some really good ideas that hopefully will address a lot of issues as the dialogue goes on because it is not over; it is just the beginning.


Nick Pagaulatus, Mission Anti-displacement Coalition


-
 
 We are having community dialogues around important issues.


-
 
 We found out that we have a very strong intent to continue working together as a community to craft something that it is going to be implementable by the [Planning] Department, enforceable by the City, and that is really going to work in meeting the goals that we have as business owners, properties owners and workers in these industries.


Kate


-
 
 We feel that we need to continue a clear focus of task force to work out the implementation details.


-
 
 Let us recognize where PDR has become offices and where there are thriving businesses.
 
 We need to make those places continue and turn back.


-
 
 We want to encourage that no matter what we do, we want these buildings full of productive thriving businesses; we do not want vacant buildings.


Brett Gladstone


-
 
 Thanked staff for introducing the idea of compliance period for three years but what would be the fees? When can we see the City Attorney's language on this?


-
 
 They need to tell us tonight what they are producing and give us some information regarding those fees.


Tom Radulovich


-
 
 The Eastern Neighborhoods is heading into the right direction but I want to make the last pitch to really look at ways of accomplishing all the goals in the rest of the Mission.


-
 
 We would like to see the RTO zoning expand into all the R zone areas and the NCT zoning use into the neighborhood commercial in the Mission District.


John Elberling


-
 
 We absolutely opposed to the rezoning of our neighborhood, Central So. of Market, because it is a very well mixed use commercial and residential.


-
 
 We would like you to do instead is to take this district out of the rezoning and do a follow up process next year that is a really community based.


Steven Weaver


-
 
 I live at 1325 Indiana Street and am here to register by opposition to the zoning from 23
rd
 to 24
th
 that the area to the North is a multiple use and ours is a PDR-2.


Reza Ghobadian


-
 
 I also live at 1325 Indiana Street and it does not make sense to have our block for PDR zoning.


-
 
 Asked to reconsider the rezoning of our neighborhood to an urban mixed use.


Mark D'Ambrosi


-
 
 We are experiencing a very high vacancy rate at the present time, at 888 Bryant Street.


-
 
 Requested that the first level qualify as PDR and the height requirement be 65 feet.


Phil Robinson and John Hays, Director of Wild Brain


-
 
 We are a creating animation studio, not an office, and animation requires drawing, a lot of creating art, coloring, painting and putting the drawings up on the wall.


-
 
 We use mixed media to create entertainment.


Bill Lightner


-
 
 We have gone a long way and the plan is well balanced.


-
 
 I support the idea of not having Conditional Use or soft-caps on the higher density areas.


Chris Chufo


-
 
 I am here again to ask your consideration of extending the UMU designation of the adjacent neighborhood down the street to Third, Indiana, 23
rd
 and 25
th
 Streets.


Glenn McNulty


-
 
 The plan is not protecting us [local small business] but puts us all in a straight jacket.


-
 
 PDR restricts our ability to grow and I am asking to extend UMU designation to the neighborhood on Indiana Street.


Jeffrey Leibovitz


-
 
 I think is a bad idea to have a Conditional Use on all retail in the SoMa area because it would put even more burden to small businesses.


Tim Colen


-
 
 We urge you to support the recommendations that staff has given you because this plan is very good and ready to move forward.


Meredyth Skemp


-
 
 Staff is doing a great job and we are very excited about the middle income housing in the UMU, the retail controls along 16
th
 Street, and the allowance of student housing.


Alexis McNulty


-
 
 Our neighborhood is only 5 blocks and we are asking to be extended to the UMU zoning.


-
 
 We represent less than 7 percent of PDR land at the Water Front area so it would not change the plan significantly.


John Tedesco


-
 
 Concerned of the new PDR zoning and how it would affect my business limiting the type of business or residents to move in.


-
 
 Requested to consider extending the UMU zoning to Indiana and Tennessee Streets.


Sarah Karlinsky


-
 
 Two points on the July 10
th
 staff's memorandum: (a) financial feasibility: stay strong on keep rooting to have the fees on the financial feasibility analysis, and (b) RTO: I am very supportive of it and the elimination of the density cap.


Tony Kelly


-
 
 We are in support of general direction on the office PDR and I think you should investigate a little bit more about SEW because it is a new concept and we do not want it to be too much powerful incentive.


-
 
 We think you need to work harder on affordable housing in the Mission District, SoMa Youth and Family zone, and increase height on the Central Water Front.


Jaime Guerrero


-
 
 We remain concerned about 16
th
 Street.
 
 We long have advocated for a UMU or other solution to activate this street.


David Prowler


-
 
 I really like the RTO, the removal of the Conditional Use and the density cap for housing, and the revisiting of fees over time.


-
 
 In an earlier staff memorandum about large UMU historic rated building permitting above first floor office and innovative industries, I think it was a good idea and you should reconsider that.


Fred Snyder


-
 
 I think we can do a lot more to make the neighborhood a lot better and I would like to participate on that discussion.


Phillip Lesser


-
 
 There is another document that was not spoken about this evening and that is a request for adoption next week on items 8 and 9 on pipeline projects and would like clarification on that.


Debra Stein


-
 
 The building where Mission Linen is has been spot zoned in a very inconsistent manner.
 
 This is not a PDR neighborhood, area or block.


-
 
 We need to recognize that this is a vibrant mixed use neighborhood.


Richard Lawson


-
 
 This proposal is eliminating the opportunity to grow my small business at Tennessee Street.


-
 
 Requested to zone this area as UMU.


Gregg Miller


-
 
 Asked to direct staff to modify the height of the Bare's property [SLI] to be uniform height at 85 feet because that parcel is a mix match ranging from 85 feet at the highest to 45 feet at the lowest.


Leonard Lynch


-
 
 I am here to oppose the down zoning of the area that includes 1150 25
th
 Street as it would affect the constitution of this area and the neighborhood.


Carolyn Hosoda


-
 
 Asked to review the zoning to UMU at Tennessee Street because our neighborhood has evolved into a much safer and better kept neighborhood.


Jeffrey Young


-
 
 Reiterate opposition to down rating of PDR zoning at Minnesota Street because we are less than 1% budget of PDR.


-
 
 We are requesting to extend us into the UMU zone.


Judy West


-
 
 I think that the primary problem that we are facing is that there is far too much disparity between the UMU and the PDR-1 designation that are being put on the North East Mission.


-
 
 Find a consistent zoning that you can apply to the entire area.
