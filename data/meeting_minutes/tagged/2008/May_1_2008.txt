 Those two topics are to be captured in an appendix to their rules and that discussion was continued to May 1, 2008.
 
 The Commission will discuss and consider possible action to adopt, amend, or not adopt proposed Appendix A of Planning Commission Rules and Regulations.

 At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.


 


SPEAKER(S)


Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 In this week's Chronicle, I think it was Sunday, Carol Lloyd did a good job on the inclusionary limits.
 
 She sort of looked at how it is working throughout the United States.


-
 
 She had some good things to say, at least in my opinion, on the flexibility that San Francisco allows in terms of the ways that the requirements can be satisfied.


-
 
 Second item, regarding today's Chronicle.
 
 I was not able to attend the hearing on the Transbay area and the discussion that staff had last night in terms of their proposals particularly surrounding the height limits.


-
 
 These are proposals at this point and nothing has been done. 
 
While they are taking into account the shadow impacts, there are going to be a lot of discussions in terms of the cost and benefits that have to come out from these projects to help fund the Transbay Terminal.


-
 
 We are at the beginning of the process and I appreciate staff's presentation.


-
 
 Third item, I'd like to thank Amit Ghosh for the pipeline study statistics he gave us.


-
 
 Fourth item, I thank Tara Sullivan-Lenane for responding to 900 Innes Avenue.
 
 The explanation spells out exactly what happened. 
 
But it is still a little troubling.


-
 
 I think it is a process problem because I have a big pile of material still sitting on my desk about that project. 
 
I was just expecting it to come back sometime.


-
 
 I appreciate the report that was given, but I hope that in the future we have a way to be noticed when items we put up for continuance are not coming back; or we are informed about their status, particularly the very significant projects.


Commissioner Moore


-
 
 I attended last night's meeting [Transbay] and staff did a very good and comprehensive presentation.


-
 
 It was packed with information and I request that this Commission be given more than just that presentation.


-
 
 Preferably, we'll have various meetings that are broken down by topics and clustered rather than just one full presentation.


Commissioner Sugaya


-
 
 I was surprised with that meeting since we requested this before that presentation.
 
 I had the assumption that studies were still in process.


-
 
 I missed the Planning Commission meeting last week because I was at the California Preservation Foundation Conference.


-
 
 The Planning Commission has received an award.
 
 Awards went to a number of different people including legislators and others.


-
 
 There was an award to save the San Francisco Flower Mart and that went to Patrick McCann.


-
 
 Board President Peskin picked 
that
 up 
the award for the Board of Supervisors
. 
 
And the award for the Planning Commission, I happened to be in attendance, and I have it here.
 
 
The other award winner was Sue Hestor for saving the Flower Mart
.


Commissioner Miguel


-
 
 I was unable to attend last night's meeting but I read the newspapers and have been following some of the comments regarding Transbay.


-
 
 The newspapers, PR, and everything else concentrates on the sky. 
 
I just want to let everyone know that I am much more concerned with what happens on the ground.


Commissioner Olague


-
 
 I have received a couple of phone calls from members of the public and I was not really sure how to respond or if there is any responce to this.


-
 
 Apparently DBI voted to increase their fees this week and I was asked whether or not the Planning Department would be doing the same.


Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator


-
 
 I believe we will be bringing fee adjustments to the Commission in the next couple of months.


Commissioner Olague


-
 
 Another thing is the inclusionary zoning and some of the amendments that were passed at the Board.
 
 I know that on-site would be required to include 15%.


-
 
 I was asked why it is that certain taller buildings are only required to have only 12% inclusionary.


Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator


-
 
 I would have to look at the Code. 
 
I believe there is a differential for tall buildings based upon some financial analysis that was done.


-
 
 I do believe that there is some differential for taller buildings but I do not know the details of it.
 
 There is probably some basis in fact.


Commissioner Olague


-
 
 Requested a special hearing for the Commission on some of what is going on with the Transit Center because it is challenging when we read about it in the newspaper first.


-
 
 Maybe information on the skylines and what is being proposed there should be included.


Commissioner Lee


-
 
 I share that thought also because it is good for the public and for us to listen to their comments and concerns.


-
 
 My question regarding that is how this fits into the rest of the City and what we approved with Rincon Hill and the skylines.


-
 
 This is very important because it is a piece of property for future generations and I think educating the public and having their comments now will help us as we deliberate.

 DIRECTOR'S REPORT


 


7.
 
 Director's Announcements


 


John Rahaim, Director


-
 
 Welcomed Commissioner Miguel to the Planning Commission.


-
 
 I attended the American Planning Association Conference these past several days and most of the topics were about climate change and how cities can address that issue.


-
 
 Las Vegas is doing some things that are frankly more progressive than I would have expected especially around the issue of water reformation and retention which is an enormous issue in that region.


-
 
 It was a successful conference perhaps because of the location with a record number of attendees.


-
 
 On another issue, Dr. Ghosh did prepare the memorandum on the pipeline report and if you have further questions about that we can certainly discuss it at a future meeting.


-
 
 Next week, Dr. Ghosh is also going to be talking to you about his analysis of the State wide propositions -- 98 and 99.


-
 
 Finally, on the Transbay proposal last night: 
 
of course we will be happy and have planned to bring it to you. 
 
But the question is on what format.


-
 
 Perhaps the best way to do it is to have that overview about the issues raised and then have subsequent meetings about some of the details.


-
 
 We anticipate having the plan proposal being done by next year.
 
 Last night was very successfully with a lot of interesting comments and questions.


Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator


-
 
 I just want to alert you that in next week's packet, Tina Tam is preparing a brief document on the hospitals and the current status of the seismic upgrades.


-
 
 We want you to see that and if you want to calendar a hearing on it, we would be happy to do so. But we thought we should start with some background information.

The sponsor is committed to using the lowest noise system that is available on the market. 
 
Of course, all the equipment would be located within the car-wash tunnel.


-
 
 
The property at 501 South Van Ness would continue operation as a car-wash and there would be some overlap with the new car-wash of at least 3 to 4 years. 
 
The sponsor is willing to keep it open for an even longer period if the Commission desires.


-
 
 
The proposed car-wash complies with the existing zoning and with the proposed Eastern Neighborhoods Mission Area Plan.


(-)Eduardo Lucio


-
 
 I'm concerned about environmental affects -- causing noise, pollution, waste of potential materials, safety, traffic increase, and this is not a business oriented district.


(-)Marc Glomb

 This is a residential area and the car-wash would increase traffic.

1969 California Street -Tobin House
 
- south side of California Street between Gough and Octavia Streets, on Assessor's Block 0649, Lot 016.
 
 The subject property is a Tudor -style, single-family residence, designed by Willis Jefferson Polk and constructed in 1915. The property is zoned RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) and is in a 40-X Height and Bulk District. 
Consideration to approve, disapprove, or approve with modifications the landmark designation of the 1969 California Street
 - Tobin House under Article 10 of the Planning Code.


Preliminary Recommendation:
 
 Approval of the Landmark Designation, and a recommendation of approval to the Board of Supervisors.


 


SPEAKER(S)


Alice Carey – Recommending landmark status of subject property


-
 
 The owners are motivated to landmark the property for numerous reasons including their desire to preserve the property and to take advantage of some of the few incentives that are offered.


-
 
 The Landmark Board did vote unanimously to approve this property as a landmark and granting this landmark status will be a permanent benefit for the City of San Francisco.


Karen McNeill, Architect


-
 
 The nomination is not based on any interior features. 
 
Therefore any interior alteration is irrelevant to its nomination.


-
 
 This house has not gone through any major alteration that significantly compromises its integrity and stability to express its historic significance.


Tony Mayer, Owner


-
 
 The home has been mostly restored to a single family dwelling. 
 
And since our occupation, we have continued to update various internal systems and static details.


-
 
 We initiated the designation of the building as a landmark because we feel it is important to preserve history for ourselves and generations to come.


 


Brett Gladstone


-
 
 
Just to make it clear, we are not here seeking a conditional use permit.


-
 
 
We met with the neighborhood association to tell them, before filing anything, what we were doing.


(-)Greg Scott


-
 
 I oppose the landmark of this property because it only became an issue to the owners when they were notified that the use of the building for commercial purpose was an illegal use.


(+)Julian Ray


-
 
 The owners have gone through a great deal of trouble to beautify the property. 
 
They are very meticulous and excellent neighbors.


(+)Jean Ray


-
 
 It is a beautiful building and it is obvious that the owners take great pride in this house.


(+)Tom Christopher


-
 
 I support the application because I'd like to see the property preserve its beauty.


(+)Raoul Kennedy


-
 
 The home looks like a jewel and it should have been a landmark long ago.


(-)Terry McGuire


-
 
 You should look at the significant issue that is going to impact homeowners in the City when this comes back to you in six months for the change by conditional use.


(-)Aleea McGuire


-
 
 You should really evaluate why they want the status and what really should be landmarked.


-
 
 The use of the building is an art gallery.

 Do not take Discretionary Review and Approve.


 


SPEAKER(S)


Sarah Huang, Discretionary Review Requestor


-
 
 
Concerned that this project would impact natural light and privacy.


-
 
 
The proposed four story building is out of scale with my own low two story house.


-
 
 
I have requested that the project sponsor provide a copy of the proposed elevation and they refused.


(-)Paul Chen


-
 
 The proposed project would not fit the characteristics of the neighborhood and I request that you review the proposed front elevation because it would block natural light.


(-)Esther Tang


-
 
 Concerned on the height and position of the proposed project, being only 3 feet away from our property, would block natural light and air.


(-)Adela Tang


-
 
 The proposed project would block natural light and air, affecting our living environment.


, Project Sponsor


-
 
 My house is my only and most valuable asset.
 
 Developing further brings security and the ability to provide for my children's future, especially their upcoming education.


-
 
 To make this project financially affordable, I have to build two units. That gives us the opportunity to provide a new quality housing space for another family in San Francisco.


-
 
 It took me more than two years to put everything together and finally be here before you.
 
 I feel that my project does not have any exceptional or extraordinary circumstances.


William Pashelinsky, Architect


-
 
 
When we met with the requestor, there was no mention of any concern to the loss of light.


-
 
 
They were worried about the timing of our demolition and asked us to delay our project because they also have a project in process.


-
 
 
The loss of light is very minimum.

Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and Approve the Demolition.


 


SPEAKER(S)


Robin Jay, Discretionary Review Requestor


-
 
 
Concerned that the upper level deck would have a significant impact on light, air and privacy.


-
 
 
There were no efforts to talk to me about the potential design plans.


-
 
 
Another issue for me is that they have a light well matching the light well I have.


(-)Don Bardole


-
 
 Concerned with the faÃ§ade design because it is not considering any consistency and compatibility with the other buildings on the block.


(-)Mike Garavaghia


-
 
 Concerned about the impacts to natural light and I request they reduce the mass of the project on the northeast corner.


Ross Levy, Project Architect


-
 
 We have proposed several compromises and have attempted to address the concerns about the mass at the rear of the building and the nature of the deck.


-
 
 Building contextually does not necessarily mean building in the exact fashion of the neighborhood houses but rather to pick up some of the lines of the structure, mass, form and materials.


(+)Alfonso Rodriguez


-
 
 We have met with the neighbors and have done various changes to accommodate their concerns.


(+)Claudia Villena


-
 
 We have been very flexible and really tried working reasonably with neighbors.


 


ACTION:
 
 Did not take Discretionary Review and approved the demolition.
