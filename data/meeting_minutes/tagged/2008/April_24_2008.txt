 Commission Comments/Questions




Inquiries/Announcements
.
 
 Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).


Future Meetings/Agendas
.
 
 At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.




 


Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 Thanked Amit Ghosh for sending the San Francisco Neighborhood market. 
 
It is a great, well done report.
 
 It is very interesting and has much of what was brought up in some newspaper article.


-
 
 That article brought up some interesting points that there was a shortage of banks and credit unions in various neighborhoods.


-
 
 An interested thing they came up with is some numbers having showing a significant increase in medium household income in 2002.


-
 
 My question for staff is that there is a difference between the San Francisco Mayor's Office of Housing data with a medium income of $65,000 and what this data has shown $92,000.
 
 Who is right?


Commissioner S. Lee


-
 
 I would like to make an announcement that I will be resigning from the Commission at the end of today's meeting.
 


-
 
 She acknowledged colleagues' work.


-
 
 I have been on this Commission for the last six years and being on this Commission has reinforced my belief that neighborhoods are really the life force of the City.


-
 
 The protection, preservation and enhancement of the quality of life in our neighborhoods are really critical to the future of the City.


Commissioner Olague


-
 
 On channel 9 there was a series called  The Natural Causes' speaking on how to create healthier neighborhoods and better quality of life living in cities.


-
 
 The Department of Public Health has done a few studies I think starting with the Eastern Neighborhoods Community Health Impact Assessment.


-
 
 Now on the web there is something called the  Healthy Development Measurement Tools' and you can find it at 
www.hdmt.org


-
 
 It does explore some of the findings that the Public Health Department made in terms of access in certain neighborhoods that can create a good quality of life.


-
 
 Yesterday, there was the opening of the ECO City Conference 2008. 
 
I believe it is an international conference and the Mayor's Office of Economic Development made arrangements to have us attend.


-
 
 A lot of the courses focused on how to create more sustainable green cities throughout the world.


-
 
 The Mayor [Newsom] gave an opening speech highlighting a lot of the goals that his administration has for creating a green city.


-
 
 I encourage staff to schedule a special hearing on the green policy as the City is creating it – sometime after the Eastern Neighborhoods, sometime in July.


-
 
 A couple of months ago, Commissioner W. Lee requested some analysis from the City on State measures 98 and 99.


-
 
 It seems to have a lot of implications in terms of how planning is done in cities around affordable housing.


-
 
 If other commissioners are interested maybe we can have an information item next week.


Commissioner W. Lee


-
 
 I would like to have it before the June election.


-
 
 Also on the request of a special hearing on the green policy, it would be good to ask someone from the Hotel Carlton to give us a brief on the cost effectiveness and return on investments on solar panels.


Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 I think it is always good to be informed to the extent that these measures would have an affect on land use policies realizing that it is an election and we can not take a position on it.


Commissioner Moore


-
 
 Regarding solar panels, I would like to ask staff as well as the City Attorney's Office that as far as I know that energy generated by solar panels that exceeds what the need is of its own facility it is not returnable to the grade.


-
 
 I think it is contrary to the idea of using solar panels as a general contribution to energy production.


-
 
 Contrary to us, in Europe you would see total small communities relying on the combination of wind and solar and being able to sell excess back to the grade.


-
 
 I think that is a true idea of sustainability. I would like that we address it as a policy issue because solar by itself creating more than you use means you loose.


-
 
 I would like to take that as part of our discussion on green policy.

 Director's Announcements


 


John Rahaim


-
 
 I will be attending the American Planning Association Conference which is happening in Las Vegas this year. 
 
It is also happens to be the 100
th
 anniversary of the conference.


-
 
 The Commission asked a couple of weeks ago for some information on the Bike Plan EIR and I just want to give some dates on that:


-
 
 It was initiated last year and the notice of preparation occurred in the summer of last year. 
 
The initial study was published on March 15 and the comment period for that phase was closed on April 14.


-
 
 That allows us to move forward with the transportation analysis, the biggest component.


-
 
 We expect that the Draft Environmental Impact Report will be published in the fall of this year and the current schedule calls for certification in spring 2009.

 Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals


 


Anmarie Rodgers


 


Land Use Committee


 




.
 
 It would fix an outdated reference to the inability to build up to 65 feet by conditional use.
 
 There were previous amendments made in 1998 to remove that capacity but this zoning table was left out of those amendments.
 
 It was 
forwarded to the Full Board
 with recommendations for approval.


Ordinance for the restoration of movie theater signs and marquees
.
 
 The Board is considering three amendments to the legislation: (a) further define what is a historic theater, (b) further carry the controls into two different types:
 
 those theaters that currently have the historic signs and those who have had the signs removed, and (c) more definition on how the signage could be used.


Status of the Eastern Neighborhoods
.
 
 The presentations are scheduled to keep the Committee abreast on the status of the content of the plan as it advances through the Planning Commission hearings.




Full Board




 
 There is a full report in your packets that you will be getting this week.
 
 The Landmarks Advisory and Preservation Board recommend approval in 2005.
 
 
Passed
.
 
 The only thing that the Board is considering is landmark status and at this time there has been no building permit applied for to do any developments.


Excelsior Fringe Financial Restricted Use District
.
 
 
Passed.


Market and Octavia Plan
.
 
 
Passed

 I request that you have a hearing on this project in six weeks because it is a very large project and we all need to digest all the information recently available.


Patricia Vaughey




We have to address this issue and set up a system to be able to follow up on this kind of case.




Dick Millet




This whole thing is a big abuse of the system.




John Bardis




Something has to be done at your level to make it clear to the departments that everybody abides by the Code. 
 
When something is done wrong, there should not be a negotiation.




 


ACTION:

 on the status of the Academy of Art University IMP (2006.0737I).
 
 The IMP contains information on the nature and history of the institution, the location and use of affiliated buildings, and development plans. An updated version of the IMP is available for viewing on the Planning Department's website (from 
www.sfplanning.org
 click  Publications & Reports  and then  Institutional Master Plans ). This is not a public hearing, only an informational item on the progress of the IMP. The IMP is not complete at this time.


 


SPEAKER(S)


Michael Burk, Academy of Arts Representative




We are here to listen, learn and respond to any questions or suggestions you may have.
 
 We tried to respond to your questions and comments and we are hopeful of being successful. 
 
But if not, let us know and we will make it better.




Patricia Vaughey




I would like the Master Plan to include on the transportation study what the regulations are for large buses coming through neighborhoods for for-profit companies versus regular schools for non-profit.




John Bardis


-
 
 The document is not complete.
 
 You should have an Environmental Impact Report and then have the Master Plan before you.


Francisco Da Costa


-
 
 This institution has adversely impacted thousands of people in the City and I'm hoping you would do the right thing.


Greg Paul


-
 
 They cannibalized the existing housing stuck for its students.
 
 Before approving a Master Plan or any conditional use, you need to consider housing fees.


Sue Hestor




The Academy of Arts just dumps its problems onto us, taking whatever they want to go and put a bus stop on that site.
 
 This really needs a real transportation analysis.




 


ACTION:
 
 This is an informational item only on the progress of the IMP.
 
 The IMP is not complete at this time.
 
 No Action is required of the Commission.

2007 Housing Inventory
.
 
 This report is the 38
th
 in the series and describes San Francisco's housing supply.
 
 
Housing Inventory
 data accounts for new housing construction, demolitions, and alterations in a consistent format for analysis of housing production trends.
 
 Net housing unit gains are reported citywide, by zoning classification, and by planning district. 
 
Other areas covered include affordable housing, condominium conversions, and residential hotel stock.
 
 In addition, lists of major housing projects completed and approved for construction in 2007 are provided.
 
 A list of affordable housing projects in the pipeline (projects in various stages of review or pre-construction planning) is included to provide a picture of likely housing construction activity in the near future.
 
 Report is available for the public at the Planning Department and on the website.


Preliminary Recommendation: No Action required.
 
 Informational only.


 


SPEAKER(S)


Mr. Groat




I am very proud of the report and I hope it continues long past my time.
 
 I am happy to see that dedication and public discussion has not changed from the 1960's to the present time.




Patricia Vaughey


-
 
 What is considered affordable?
 
 This is something that this Commission has to have to address sooner or later of what is being built and being presented as affordable.


Greg Paul


-
 
 It was interesting to read the information on condominiums and I'm wondering if it is possible to include the TIC information as well.


 


ACTION:
 
 Informational only.
 
 No action is required of the Commission.

 GENERAL
 
PUBLIC COMMENT – 15 MINUTES
 
 (Tape IIA)


 


At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.
 
 With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting.
 
 Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.


 


SPEAKER(S)


Patricia Vaughey


-
 
 Institutions must have a Master Plan in place addressing expansion, transportation and a lot of other issues before anything else is approved.


-
 
 We have got to figure out ways of doing special use districts that protect small businesses because big companies are offering large amounts to lease spaces in the City.


-
 
 What are the impacts of the high rises and how it would they affect tourism?


Michael Burk


-
 
 Thanked Commissioner Sue Lee for her dedication in public service.


John Bardis




Thanked Commissioner Sue Lee for her work at the Commission.


Institutions need to get their Master Plans first and then proceed according to the Code.

Request for Conditional Use Authorization
 under Planning Code Sections 303 and 209.2(c) to legalize the conversion of a tourist hotel ( Star Motel ) to group housing for a post-secondary educational institution ( Academy of Art University ) in an RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Hold public hearing to allow public comment and continue item to allow for additional neighborhood outreach and completion of environmental review.


(Continued from Regular Meeting of March 20, 2007)


 


SPEAKER(S)


Michael Burk, Academy of Arts Representative


-
 
 I'm requesting a continuance because an environmental review is not complete yet and so we can continue communication with neighbors to address concerns.


-
 
 Smoking and skate boards would not be allowed. 
 
Also, the number of rooms would be converted from doubles to singles dropping the over all student population.


-
 
 There have been concerns about noise but police statistics speak for themselves and there has been an incredible dramatic improvement.


(-)Delou Jordan


-
 
 I'm concerned about criminal activities, nuisance in the neighborhood, and the lack of security at the university.


(-)Patricia Vaughey


-
 
 I have not heard a word from the Academy of Arts with the actual intent to remedy this whole situation. 
 
They are just saying they are trying but not really working on it.


(-)Eileen Dick


-
 
 This conditional use is inappropriate because the use does not belong and it would be difficult to make the necessary findings.


(-)Greg Paul


-
 
 Approving this application would be reinforcing the attitude of buying first and asking the Commission to legalize it later.
 
 By denying it, you would be sending a strong message.


(-)Sue Hestor
