Initiation of an amendment to the Planning Code
 
to
 
add Section 249.37 for the creation of a Special Use District, the 1500 Page Street Residential Care Special Use District.
 
The proposal is to
 
rehabilitate and expand the existing but vacant residential care use by adding a partial fifth floor and a required egress stair within the required rear yard of the existing four-story residential care use.
 
 The building would accommodate up to 48 formerly homeless residents of low and very low income levels. The specific provisions of the proposed SUD would allow the following exceptions from Code requirements upon approval of a Conditional Use authorization: floor area ratio (FAR), required rear yard area, expansion of a non-complying structure, front setback, and off-street loading requirement. The proposal is sponsored by a non-profit agency in conjunction with the Mayor's Office of Housing. The property is located within an RM-1 (Residential, Mixed, Low Density) Zoning District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.
