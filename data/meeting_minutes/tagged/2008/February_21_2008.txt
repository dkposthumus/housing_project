 Commission Comments/Questions


Â·
 
 
Inquiries/Announcements
.
 
 Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).


Â·
 
 
Future Meetings/Agendas
.
 
 At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.


 


Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 First, I want to thank Dwight Alexander for his service, time and effort on the Planning Commission for about four years.


-
 
 Second, we received a report from the Back Street Advisory Committee. 
 
It is a nice report.


-
 
 What I like about it is that it refers to actual businesses that are there and gives an opportunity to talk to them and get their perspectives to find out abut the issues are relevant, like the PDR situation.


-
 
 Third, there was an article in the Chronicle on Monday by John King that talks about parcels along Octavia Boulevard and that unfortunately the process is moving very slowly.


-
 
 I believe that these parcels were set aside mostly for affordable housing but have not been able to be redeveloped because the discussions are still going on at the Board of Supervisors as to the Market Octavia Plan.


Commissioner W. Lee


-
 
 Following up Commissioner Antonini's comments, I would like to request that Peter Cohen comes to the Commission and give a presentation on the Back Street report.


-
 
 I read in the Examiner that the African American community makes about $11,000 per year and I am concern that if they are working 40-hour weeks that violates the City's minimum wage law.


-
 
 One question that I would like Peter Cohen to answer is how he got those figures.


Commissioner Olague


-
 
 I would like to let you know that we are working now with the Mayor's Office of Economic Development to come in and give us some report on some of the industrial areas and economic analysis.


-
 
 And, we are working on bringing the Back Street Advisory Committee to present on that report.


Commissioner Moore


-
 
 Reading the Back Street report and visiting the Mission in a short number of days made the bulbs go on. 
 
I believe that we need to spend more time looking at that and in a little bit more detail.


-
 
 I think it is coming under the microscope and with the fresh eyes of Director Rahaim, we all have the ability to have an intelligent discussion and bring people to the table who can really add a little bit more reality of that working environment.


-
 
 This really raised my interest and it will be interesting to discuss that with staff.

John Rahaim, Director


-
 
 From the staff perspective, I'd like to also thank Dwight Alexander for his service to the Commission.


-
 
 The Mayor announced today his preferred appointment for a new commissioner, Ryan Brooks. 
 
Of course that appointment would have to be confirmed by the Board of Supervisors as well.


-
 
 I am planning on taking two tours of the Mission within the next couple of weeks: (1) at the invitation of the Mission Economic Development Organization, and (2) with a group of property owners in northeast Mission.

575 6TH STREET (FLOWER MART)
 
- 
Informational
 item to discuss current status of uses at 575 6th Street (Flower Mart) and the Academy of Art University's future plans for the site.


 


SPEAKER(S)


Michael Burke, Academy of Arts University Representative


-
 
 
This past weekend we offered to all existing tenants the opportunity to enter into a lease agreement that would provide three year terms with fixed rent if we purchase the Flower Mart.


-
 
 
In order to net out the anticipated increases in property taxes, we would give the tenants 6 months of free rents.


-
 
 
We have been working very hard with the Mayor's Office and Supervisor Peskin to address the Flower Mart issue.
 
 We would like to continue our discussions with them.


-
 
 
I am hopeful that this matter will be finally resolved within the next week or so.


-
 
 
I ask that you not take action today on items 12 and 13. 
 
We would be here next week since this matter is a standing item on the Director's Report.


Patrick McCann, Representing most of the tenants at the Flower Mart


-
 
 
We received lease proposals and are having the lease attorney to take a look at them. 
 
There are a lot of holes in the lease that needs to be addressed as far as parking, property boundaries and side issues.


-
 
 
At this point, it is a three year lease with a four months termination by the leaser.


Sue Hestor


-
 
 
In reading this lease, it is absolutely silly. 
 
It is a straight commercial lease without the property description recognizing it as a Flower Mart.


-
 
 
This is an appearance of compliance without the substance of compliance.


Patricia Vaughey


-
 
 The Commerce and Industry section of the Planning Code clearly states that as a policy of the City not to loose existing businesses and existing jobs. 
 
The City has legal basis to take this to court should the Academy of Arts try to do this.


Francisco Da Costa


-
 
 
This matter has gone before some other committees and it is not understandable that an institution that is supposed to impart standards to students has thousands of violations all over the City. 
 
It is time to take a holistic approach to do the right thing.






John Bardis


-
 
 Questioned if the Academy of Arts has an Institutional Master Plan on file at the Planning Department.
 
 They should not even been operating.

 GENERAL
 
PUBLIC COMMENT – 15 MINUTES


 


At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.
 
 With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting.
 
 Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.


 


SPEAKER(S)


Francisco Da Costa


-
 
 Does the City mandate that we have an economic analysis?
 
 If it is relevant to the 30,000 affordable units in the pipeline, where can I find it?


-
 
 Also, where can I find a sound document on transportation done by this Department?


Hiroshi Fukuda, Coalition of Sunset Neighborhood


-
 
 Read a resolution from the coalition requesting the Board of Supervisors to make substantial changes to the Market-Octavia Plan to comply with Planning Code Section 302(d).


 


E.
 
 CONSENT CALENDAR


 


All matters listed hereunder constitute a Consent Calendar, are considered to be routine by the Planning Commission, and will be acted upon by a single roll call vote of the Commission.
 
 There will be no separate discussion of these items unless a member of the Commission, the public, or staff so requests, in which event the matter shall be removed from the Consent Calendar and considered as a separate item at this or a future hearing.

Preliminary Recommendation: Take DR and approve the building permit application with modifications.


 


SPEAKER(S)


Katherine Faye Yumul, Discretionary Review Requestor


-
 
 
The proposed project would have a major impact on my light and air. 
 
It would tower over my back yard.


-
 
 
The owners are big property owners and developers and own a construction company.


-
 
 
I believe they now live in a 4,000 square foot house at 1595 5
th
 Avenue. 
 
I have a list and photographs of properties that they own in San Francisco.


-
 
 
We have been very frustrated by the lack of cooperation by the developers throughout this process with no efforts to reduce impacts on the neighborhood.


-
 
 
They opposed a meeting before the submittal of documentation for this project.


(-)Don Holloway


-
 
 These developers are building a mega home showing no regard for the surrounding neighbors and it is not consistent with the character of the block.


(-)James Kelliher


-
 
 We are concerned with the developer's insensitive treatment about our concerns for air, light and visual impacts to the neighborhood.


(-)Chin Lam


-
 
 I'm in support of the neighbors because the developers just want to make money and are not taking into consideration concerns of the neighborhood.


(-)Cindy Pang


-
 
 Project sponsor has been very uncooperative and our concerns have not been addressed. 
 
Also, many neighbors were not notified about this project.


(-)Diana Huang


-
 
 I'm in support of neighbor's concerns on the impact of sunlight and air. 
 
I ask you to reconsider the current plan proposal and modify it.


(-)Jack Keller


-
 
 You should place restrictions on the size and bulk of the proposed building to lessen impacts to the neighbors.
 


(-)Jacky Pang


-
 
 The shadow produced by the proposed building would affect most residential units in the neighborhood.


Helen Lam, Project Sponsor representative


-
 
 The project has been revised nine times in order to meet the Planning Code, design guidelines and to address most of the issues brought up by the requestor.


-
 
 We met twice with the neighbors and provided two shadow studies that indicated no major impact to the neighbor.


-
 
 We tried to resolve the issues from the requestor and the sponsor just wants to have a decent home and hopes that the project can go forward.


(+)Calvin Eng


-
 
 
Our intention is to live there and this project would allow us to accommodate our family.


-
 
 
We stopped going to the meetings because there was no compromise.


(+)Tommy Eng


-
 
 Our intention is to accommodate our family. 
 
We have spent a lot of time and money to do it.


(+)Peony Eng


-
 
 
Our house is not that big and all we are trying to do is to accommodate our family.


(+)Mark Brannan


-
 
 This request should not be raised to the level of a discretionary review.


 


ACTION:
 
 Took Discretionary Review and approved the project per staff recommendations:


-No roof deck


-Requiring window expression that more closely resemble the 3-D renderings submitted at today's hearing

 Street (Assessor's Block 3833, Lots 001, 002, and 003 and Assessor's Block 3834, Lot 001) - 
Public Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Report
. The project involves construction of a 659,000 gross sq. ft. mixed-use project in three buildings on a vacant, 3.15-acre triangular site bounded by Hubbell, 7th and 16th Streets, including 425,000 sq. ft. of residential use (408 dwelling units), 15,000 sq. ft. of ground-floor commercial space, and 20,000 sq. ft. of production, distribution and repair space. The project entails construction of publicly accessible open space along an upgraded Daggett Street right-of-way bisecting the site, as well as a landscaped plaza at the corner of Hubbell and Connecticut Streets, which could accommodate a transit right-of-way and transfer station for future MUNI bus service. A two-level parking garage would provide 400 independently accessible parking spaces. The garage's lower-level entrance would be located on 7th Street and the entrance/exit to the upper garage would be on Hubbell Street. A separate entrance to the retail garage would be on 16th Street. Pedestrian entrances would be provided along 16th, Hubbell and Daggett Streets. Building heights would range from 55 to 85 feet. The project site is within an M-2 (Heavy Industrial) Zoning District, a 50-X Height and Bulk District and within the Eastern Neighborhoods planning area, which is the subject of a potential rezoning.


Note: written comments will be accepted at the Planning Department's offices until the close of business on March 10, 2008.

Appeal of Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration
 for the construction of a 5-story, 50-foot-tall building totaling approximately 29,829 square feet, with 17 dwelling units and about 2,852 square feet of retail space.
 
 The project site (Block 3588, Lot 012) is in the Valencia Neighborhood Commercial District and a 50-X Height and Bulk District.
 
 The project site is in the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan Area and is subject to the Housing/Mixed Use Guidelines.
 
 The proposed project would require a Conditional Use Authorization.


Preliminary Recommendation: Uphold Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration


(Continued from Regular Meeting of January 31, 2008)


 


SPEAKER(S)


Martin Winderl


-
 
 In the City's response to the appeal, there are no numbers to know if the response is based on opinion or fact.


-
 
 The Planning Department has sent engineers and architects who work with numbers to arrive at a conclusion.


-
 
 I believe that if this project gets approved in its present form, the City does not offer concession and solutions to problems.
 
 I am entirely against this project.


Sue Hestor


-
 
 We have continuous problems with these environmental appeals because the Planning Department does not analyze on accumulative context.


-
 
 The Valencia Street corridor is the front line of the Mission. 
 
We have been transforming the housing stock and the pattern of who occupies the housing.


-
 
 How are we changing the context of the Mission?


(+)Phillip Lesser


-
 
 This corner has been a vacant lot for a long time and these people have been in the neighborhood and now they are reinvesting in our neighborhood.


(+)Ron Mallia


-
 
 This is exactly what the corridor needs.


(+)Tim Colen


-
 
 We endorse this project because the lot has been vacant for a long time and getting rid of a parking lot to have housing is a good addition to the neighborhood.


(-)Robert Kohler


-
 
 We submitted hundreds of letters in opposition to this project because of concerns about the size, scale and height on Valencia Street changing completely the character of the neighborhood.


(-)Whit Smith


-
 
 I'm concerned about the height of the project and asked the Department to make this project more consistent with the character of the neighborhood.




(-)Anthony Argelicola


-
 
 The impact of lost street parking, shadows, substantial increase in noise and dust during construction was not addressed efficiently by the EIR [Environment Impact Report.]


(-)Julie Ledbetter


-
 
 This is going to be a huge increase in density and Valencia Street is mainly residential in character.

Request for Conditional Use Authorization
 pursuant to Planning Code Sections 303, 121.1, 726.11 and 161(j) to construct a five-story, 17-unit mixed-use development with a reduction in the parking requirement on a 10,000 square foot lot. The property is located within the Valencia Neighborhood Commercial District within a 50-X Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: Approve with Conditions


(Continued from Regular Meeting of January 31, 2008)


 


SPEAKER(S)


Project Sponsor


-
 
 Half of century of hard work gave Mr. Barrios the opportunity to buy this empty lot and build a mixed use project to bring families into the Mission as well as establish new businesses in the Valencia Street corridor.


-
 
 The final plans represent a unique environmentally sensitive project.


Fred Pollack, Architect


-
 
 Currently, the parking lot has two curb cuts and the new development would have only one, thereby increasing street parking.


-
 
 [Showed images of current pattern on Valencia Street to prove a pattern of increased height]


-
 
 The roof plan, in the court yard, steps down allowing better light and air on the back of the site respecting the rear yards.


(-)[No name stated]


-
 
 The height is not acceptable for this type of project.


(-)Julie Ledbetter


-
 
 Asked for a compromise to increase affordability of either an additional unit or to have the inclusionary set to 80% BMI.


(+)[No name stated]


-
 
 The height of this project is actually lower than what we are looking at in the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan and we already have a lot of affordable housing in the Mission.


(-)Robert Kohler


-
 
 I'm opposed to the project because it is out of character with the neighborhood.


(-)Anthony Argelicola


-
 
 I'm opposed to the project in terms of height, density and faÃ§ade particularly on Valencia Street.


(+)Tim Colen


-
 
 We all agree that we need more affordable housing but there is not enough subsidy and funds. 
 
This project is doing what it can and it should be approved.


(-)Cindy Icke


-
 
 The height is out of character because most of the buildings are 2 or 3 stories and it would cast us in shadow.




(-)Whit Smith


-
 
 This project is not in keeping with the character of the neighborhood particularly the height of it.


(-)Leonid Oliker


-
 
 The size of the project is out of scale and character.


(-)James


-
 
 I request that you increase the setbacks to mitigate impacts on the neighbors' properties.


(-)Sue Hestor


-
 
 These units are going to be priced for an amount that most of San Franciscans can not afford.


-
 
 We are going to lose the character of the Mission and will not be able to walk and bike there.


(+)Mathew


-
 
 Reiterated that the project meets all the requirements, standards, zoning for open space, and the objectives of the General Plan for the City.


(-)Suzanne


-
 
 This project is going to increase traffic in an already congested traffic area.


 


ACTION:
 
 Approved as amended:


-Project Sponsor is to continue working with staff on design on 19

-Continue to receive comments from neighbors in the area on the design for both elevations.

 The mission is to empower Asian youth and their families by providing development through education, employment training, advocacy and other supportive services.


-
 
 Over the course of 38 years, we have expanded our programs and serve annually over 3,000 low income high need and at risk families.


-
 
 We are currently providing 19 programs in the area on behavioral health, education, intervention, leadership development and workforce development.


-
 
 We are only occupying the building partially and can not fully operate unless we get approval of the conditional use permit.


(+)Beverly

PUBLIC COMMENT


 


At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.
 
 With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.
 
 When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.
 
 Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.


 


The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.
 
 In response to public comment, the commission is limited to:


 


(1)
 
 responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or


(2)
 
 requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or


(3)
 
 
directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.
 
 (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))


 


 


SPEAKER(S)


Sue Hestor


-
 
 Asked that next week's hearing during the discussion of Rules and Regulations that you consider the notices to the neighborhood because projects that fully impact neighbors do not send out notices and minor projects like adding a deck requires it.


-
 
 Also, staff's recommendations and plans are not available until a week before the hearing and do not give the opportunity to the public to be well informed.


Julie Ledbetter


-
 
 It is hard to make a case when coming to the Commission if we do not have all the information.
