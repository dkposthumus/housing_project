UPPER MARKET COMMUNITY DESIGN PLAN
 
- 
The San Francisco Planning Department has published a document entitled  Upper Market Community Design Plan. 
 
 The plan area generally includes properties fronting Market Street between Octavia Boulevard on the east and Collingwood Street on the west.
 


 


Prior to initiating community workshops, the Department and its consultant team explored existing conditions in the neighborhood.
 
 The Department conducted outreach meetings with representatives of the Castro and nearby neighborhood organizations.
 
 The Department held three community workshops.
 
 The themes of the workshops focused on: 1.) Community Vision (September 2007); 2.) Community Design Framework (October 2007); and 3.) Design Strategies (December 2007).
 
 The outcome of the workshops is a Design Plan that contains a program for public realm improvements and design guidelines for private development that incorporate the identity, character, economic and social composition of the Upper Market area and its surrounding neighborhoods.


 


The Plan responds to physical, social, and economic conditions in the Project area, and establishes a plan for public and private improvements in the Project Area.
 
 The Plan identifies existing physical, infrastructure and economic conditions in the Upper Market neighborhood, considers historical context and identifies key neighborhood assets, challenges and opportunities to revitalize the neighborhood.
 
 It includes an Urban Design Framework section that: describes planning strategies that may be used to guide Urban Design improvements along the upper Market Street corridor.
 
 The Plan also proposes improvements to the public realm, including public spaces, sidewalks, and plazas.
 


 


The Plan incorporates Design Guidelines that may be used to guide design character for new buildings, and provides an overview of the steps that may be taken to achieve neighborhood improvements. The Upper Market Community Design Plan:


 




Identifies the community's five highest priority public infrastructure improvement projects,


Actions that neighborhood residents, business owners and community organizations may take to support improvements, and


Outlines design guidelines that may be used by both developers and city planners


The Plan also identifies potential funding sources for street and sidewalk improvements. "

Note: Item Number 17 and Item Number 18 include components of the Eastern Neighborhoods Program, 
a broad effort to examine and amend City Codes and the General Plan in order to better plan for growth in a significant portion of land in the southeast quadrant of the City.


 


The subject of the proposed rezoning is an approximately 2,200-acre project area that includes four neighborhoods on the eastern side of San Francisco: East SoMa, the Mission, Showplace Square/Potrero Hill and the Central Waterfront. The proposed rezoning would introduce new use (zoning) districts, including: (1) districts that would permit only production, distribution and repair (PDR) uses; (2) districts that would permit at least some PDR uses in combination with commercial and/or residential uses; (3) districts mixing residential and commercial uses; and (4) new residential-only districts. The new districts would replace existing industrial, commercial and residential single-use districts. The project would also include certain adjustments to height limits. In conjunction with the proposed rezoning, the Planning Department is also developing area plans for inclusion within the General Plan for the four neighborhoods in the project area. These plans address policy-level issues pertaining to housing, transportation, historic resources, urban design (including building heights and urban form), open space, and community facilities.
 


 


The Eastern Neighborhoods Plan Area generally encompasses:




East SoMa (the eastern portion of the South of Market district), bounded generally by Folsom Street on the northwest, the Rincon Hill Plan area (essentially, Second Street) on the east, Townsend Street on the south, and Fourth Street on the west, with an extension to the northwest bounded by Harrison, Seventh, Mission, Sixth (both sides), Natoma, Fifth, and Folsom Streets;


the Mission, bounded by 13th and Division Streets on the north, Potrero Avenue on the east, CÃ©sar ChÃ¡vez Street on the south, and Guerrero Street on the west;


the Showplace Square/Potrero Hill district, generally bounded by Bryant Street and 10th Street on the northwest, Seventh Street on the northeast, Interstate Highway 280 (I-280) on the east, 25th and 26th Streets on the south, and Potrero Avenue on the west; and


the Central Waterfront, bounded by Mariposa Street on the north, San Francisco Bay on the east, Islais Creek on the south, and I-280 on the west.

CENTRAL SUBWAY PROJECT
 
-
 
Certification of the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Report
 
prepared for Central Subway which is Phase 2 of the Third Street Light Rail project.
 
 (The environmental document has been prepared to meet the requirements of both CEQA and NEPA and analyzes updated information from the original EIS/EIR that was certified in 1998.)
 
 The proposed project is to provide Muni Metro rail service from 4th and King (current terminus of Phase 1-the T-Third line) to Chinatown in a mostly subway configuration. The proposed alignment would operate on Fourth and Stockton Streets with a deep underground crossing of Market Street. The alignment would be on the surface of Fourth Street beginning at King Street and go underground between Bryant and Harrison (under the I-80 freeway). There would be a surface station at 4
th
 and Brannan Streets and three underground stations at Moscone, Union Square/Market, and Chinatown.


Preliminary Recommendation:  Certify the Environmental Impact Report


 
 Please note: The public hearing on the Draft EIR is closed. The public comment period for the Draft EIR ended on December 10, 2007. The Planning Commission does not conduct public review of Final EIRs. Public comments on the certification may be presented to the Planning Commission during the Public Comment portion of the Commission calendar.
