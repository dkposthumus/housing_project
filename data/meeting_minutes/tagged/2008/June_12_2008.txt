SPEAKER(S)


Jon Lau, Supervisor Maxwell's Office


-
 
 The hearing at the Land Use Committee on Monday had the topic of places to live and benefits discussion.
 
 It had quite a long public comment component.


-
 
 There were certainly concerns expressed wanting to ensure that we really explore a set of scenarios and building prototypes such that the fees and affordable housing requirements we are proposing truly take into account differences, size, and later cost of different projects.


-
 
 These concerns were certainly acknowledged and I just wanted to share that tonight.


Britt Tanner, MTA


-
 
 
The TEP is one of the first really comprehensive reviews of MUNI.


-
 
 
[Showed map of where there is more transit activity in the Eastern Neighborhoods.]


-
 
 
The TEP is a very short term plan and we are anticipating changes that would happen in the future beyond the five year plan of this project.


-
 
 
The plan to extend and improve MUNI lines in the Mission Corridor, SoMa, the Potrero Hill connection to the Downtown and Mission Bay.


-
 
 
Everything that I presented to you is only a proposal at this point.


-
 
 
The public comment period is ending on June 15 and anyone interested could do it through 311 or by sending an e-mail to 
info@sftep.com
 and we would incorporate that feedback.


David Buffret, Planner with the Port of San Francisco


-
 
 The Port has been working on a master plan for Pier 70 for the past 18 months and we have been working with your staff.


-
 
 Pier 70 is generally bounded by Mariposa Street on the North from Mission Bay, Illinois Street on the East of the American Industrial Center Buildings, and 22
nd
 Street on the South and the Major Power Plant.


-
 
 The project is a 65 acre brown field in size and the idea is to adapt the reuse of the historic structure and the new development that reconcile regulatory economic merit, historic preservation, open space, and access use.


-
 
 In June of last year we started our community outreach and had our first public meeting that provided the ground work for the planning process.


-
 
 In November of last year we presented a plan work concept to the community basically looking at the historic resource preservation issues.


-
 
 We are preparing a financial disposition strategy, will continue the community outreach, and prepare a draft master plan to go to the public in a workshop on July 17.


April, South of Market Community Action Network


-
 
 
What we have heard so far is good but it does not really address what we see for who the existing community and residents are.


-
 
 
Presented data from the 2007 Census and demographics of the neighborhood.


-
 
 
One of our proposals is to emphasize a Youth and Family zone in the South of Market to support and enhance existing investments.


-
 
 
There are about 3,000 affordable housing units in the pipeline and there have been a lot of investments in the parks.


-
 
 
The concept of a Youth and Family zone was developed with our youth and the youth coordinator was here but due to the schedule changing it is disempowering the public.


Chris Durazo


-
 
 
We want growth for this community and one of the things that we are looking at is having 100% affordable housing with a unit mix that includes 4, 3, and 2 bedrooms with 0 â 120% of San Francisco Median Income.


-
 
 
We would like to have institutional uses and recreational uses permitted, conditional uses for childcare and schools; and to make sure that they are at least 50% neighborhood serving and affordable.


-
 
 
We do not want to allow storage and biotech but we do want to encourage green industries into the media with the condition to provide training.


-
 
 
We want to make sure that the impact fees would help for ongoing maintenance.


Jazzie Collins


-
 
 
We have some high traffic areas that need to be addressed for pedestrian safety before the plan gets implemented.


-
 
 
We need more affordable housing and businesses in our neighborhood.


Nick Pagoulatos


-
 
 
Read a letter from members of the Mission and South of Market that could not stay for the hearing due to the delay but are concerned with the process disempowering the community.


-
 
 
Requested that the remaining meetings be time certain.


Oscar Grande, PODER


-
 
 
We have been in this process for seven years and I am here to submit signatures of people that are here.


Roberto


-
 
 Submitted a letter for Commissioner Olague.


Debra Walker, North East Mission


-
 
 Over the past ten years, approvals by this Commission have been dramatically changing the nature and shape of the North East Mission from an industrial area to one that is currently being determined as mixed used.


-
 
 A lot of the streets are more like alleys than roadways and it is one of the things that contribute to the unsafe nature of these areas.


-
 
 A lot of the PDR is taking on the nature of late night entertainment with clubs, restaurants, and theaters that have required night time pedestrians and none of these have been considered as you put forward this plan.


-
 
 Requested to use the UMU as a buffer between housing and existing PDR.


Fernando Marti


-
 
 Part of the Eastern Neighborhoods implementation plan and study says that SFMTA, SFCTA and Planning should identify specific transit service improvements and funding.
 
 Who is going to do that and how long will it take?


Sue Hestor


-
 
 The issues that we have not seen adequately addressed are the scale of the existing housing.


-
 
 The Mission does not have good transit and it also has hills.
 
 The Folsom MUNI line is terrible.


-
 
 There are no open spaces.


-
 
 The Zoning Administrator is getting the most power on this because he can make a lot of determinations.


Jaime Guerrero


-
 
 This process is all about extracting values from developers and getting public benefits for affordable housing and by down zoning. 
 
You are not going to get it.


Beth Weintraub


-
 
 The PDR proposed for the area in the northeast Mission would eliminate the cohesion that we are starting to create on our own.


-
 
 Consider putting UMU and a much heavier buffer would really improve the attitude and joy that the Mission has.


Marlon Crump


-
 
 Everyone is more concerned about displacement and lack of community participation.


Fred Snyder


-
 
 
We need Rainbow Grocery to stay.


-
 
 
Fees that need to be charged for live-work, we should look at that but also look at the entire neighborhood.


-
 
 
Glad to hear that public transit is going to be improved on 16
th
 Street.


Megan Gaydos, SFDPH


-
 
 We are encouraged by the extent to which this plan incorporates access for a complete neighborhood.


-
 
 We look forward to learning more about the public benefits program in coming hearings.


Kepa Askenasy, Potrero Hill


-
 
 We have been advocating since 2003 that height limits be 50 feet on parcels along the freeways.


-
 
 I am curious of how staff decided that brick warehouses be over the design center.


Jean Snyder


-
 
 It is very out of touch to place PDR in an area where businesses do not want to be.
 
 You are not going to get tenant there.


-
 
 You have to look at what exists in the neighborhoods and then consider what you want to impose.


Salvador
Gonzales, Mission Neighborhood Center


-
 
 We believe that 24
th
 and Harrison Streets should be a place for social services.


-
 
 Therefore, we are requesting that the zoning for our properties be NCT as well as a height increase to 65 feet.


Tony Kelly, Potrero Boosters


-
 
 I hope you take a serious look at the SoMa Youth and Family zone because it is a terrific community based solution to their needs.


-
 
 You committed the hearing at a certain time and you moved it earlier, people responded to that.
 
 And people had to leave because you were behind schedule.


-
 
 You can not really call 16
th
 Street a transit corridor to Show Place Square unless there is a bus.
 
 We strongly suggest getting the transit first and then talk about height density.


Lupe Arreola


-
 
 
Open space is very important for the families that we work with.


-
 
 
They do not have space in their homes and they go to the parks where they can feel part of a community.


Jaime Trejo, MEDA and MAC


-
 
 The heights along Mission Street would further increase the rent and prices of homes.
 
 Height as a right to 85 feet should not be allowed unless it means more inclusionary housing.


Kate Sofis


-
 
 
We need to have safe streets and open spaces in the northeast Mission.


-
 
 
We need more lighting on the streets.


[No name stated]


-
 
 We need to consider the pedestrian experience in the South of Market carefully when we are talking about design.


Earl Gee


-
 
 Strongly urged the Planning Commission to consider lowering the proposed height on Sea Wall Lot 330 from 105 feet to 45 feet to maintain the Embarcadero as an open and bright area boulevard.


Jeff Smith


-
 
 What we really argued for is to go back into integrating the living along with the working.
 
 It has worked for us in our neighborhood, 20
th
 and Hampshire Streets.


Dick Millet, Potrero Booster Neighborhood Association


-
 
 The properties under the 101 Freeway are not talked about because it belongs to the Highway but we are talking about land use here and it should be incorporated.


-
 
 The gymnasiums are being zoned out and we have to save them.


-
 
 Regarding transportation, the 22 is being rerouted to go on 16
th
 Street to Mission Bay to turn left on Third Street and you can not put another public transportation on Third Street.


Dan Murphy, Principal of Urban Green Development


-
 
 Concerned about the requirement for  mid-block 20-foot wide pedestrian uses because that eliminates sponsor and Commission discussion on how open space can be provided in a more qualitative manner.


-
 
 We proposed an alternative to improve Dagget Street as a public street capturing the open space there which is currently a publicly owned unused street in the Show Place Square area.


Corinne Woods


-
 
 When we talk about complete neighborhoods, we have to figure out a way to get there and one of the problems with this plan is that there is no enforceable linkage between what we want to see and how to get there.


Katie Morales


-
 
 Asked for a reconsideration to exclude a lot between 2
nd
, Third and Harrison Streets from the East SoMa plan and to allow higher density for housing.


J. Andre Clark


-
 
 The Sea Lot 330 should have a 45 foot height limit to be consistent with the South Beach and Water Front Neighborhoods.


-
 
 Submitted signed petition from nearly 350 residents.


Tom Gilberti


-
 
 There is so much noise in the neighborhood and you need to consider that.
 
 From a garage there are 67 decimals, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.


Philip Lesser


-
 
 I like the fact that 17
th
 and Folsom is going to be turned into a park.


-
 
 The UMU zone works and it is much more flexible.


-
 
 No one has talked about parking and we have enormous opportunities like Mariposa and Bryant to put a couple of levels of parking and housing on top of that.


 


[No name stated]


-
 
 
Opposed to PDR zoning on Duboce and13
th
 Streets and on Folsom Streets.
 
 We would like to stay with the current zone.


-
 
 
We would like to stay serving the community with the possibility for growth.


Madeline Born


-
 
 Not allowing curb cuts is not practical and may cause complicated problems like hardships for the elderly.


-
 
 Most projects do not allow one-to-one parking but there are situations where a higher parking ratio is practical and it should be allowed.


Grace Shanahan


-
 
 The additional 5 foot height will encourage a stronger and healthier area but this will not lead to more housing.


-
 
 All parcels should gain at least 1 floor.
 
 Reducing the height from 50 to 45 feet will not accomplish the goal to gain more housing.


-
 
 SROs [Single Room Occupancy] should be built for San Franciscans of all income levels.
 
 It works well for students living close to the campus.


Shawn


-
 
 There seems to be a lot of significance for buildings over 50 years old and just because of that, it does mean that it is going before the Landmarks Board.


-
 
 Many more criteria should be taken into consideration and not just the age.


-
 
 In the last two years, SRO is the only form of rental housing that has been produced.
 
 You should take a look at that.


John O'Connell


-
 
 While I agree we are having high quality design of street facing buildings, these specific restrictions may limit the creativity and overall quality of some designs and some flexibility should be allowed.


-
 
 More clarification is needed on vertical orientation of windows facing the street and its material.


-
 
 Historical preservation: sending buildings of 50 years under 50 feet in height is going to add another layer to the process.


-
 
 Consider incentives for market rate rental housing.
