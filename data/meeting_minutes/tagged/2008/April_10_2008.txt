 Commission Comments/Questions
 
 
(Tape IA)




.
 
 Without discussion, at this time Commissioners may make announcements or inquiries of staff regarding various matters of interest to the Commissioner(s).


.
 
 At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.




 


Commissioner Antonini


-
 
 In the Examiner, there was an editorial that referred to the City Commission study and dealt with the 2007 USA census.


-
 
 I'd like to get a copy for the Commissioners because I think it is very insightful.


-
 
 There have been a number of reports about this study and the most noticeable one was a comment by the Mayor where he says that San Francisco's population was undercounted by about 100,,000 and this study supports reasons to believe that is true.


-
 
 Of equal importance was the fact that the study indicated that huge amounts of money was being spent by San Franciscans outside of San Francisco.


-
 
 It also looks particularly at what had been historically the 12 lowest income neighborhoods.


-
 
 Something interesting about the study is that the median income of these neighborhoods had increased between 2000 and 2007.


-
 
 It shows particular areas of need for grocery services and banking.


-
 
 I think that educational process studies should get as much exposure as possible because it brings some very good points in.


-
 
 This is an important subject and I would like to see that study.


Commissioner Moore


-
 
 I would like to comment on an article about the progress report on Sea Wall Lot 377. 
 
I am delighted to see a direction emerging that I think is very urban and has a lot of promise.


-
 
 I was surprised about the diverse points presented and what is now shaping out.
 
 It is very promising.


-
 
 Director Rahaim sits on the review panel and I am very encouraged by seeing that as the first result coming out of this participation.


Commissioner W. Lee


-
 
 I read the SPUR Newsletter this past month that said that the Planning, Building, Fire and Health Departments work together to streamline the process for restaurants.


-
 
 I was wondering if the Director could give us a sense of the accomplishments. 
 
Is it actually faster if you would open a restaurant in the City?
 
 What changes were made to be more efficient in helping out project sponsors that want to open a restaurant?


-
 
 This year, 2008, we still have a lot of buildings that are under construction and I am really worried for 2009.
 
 I'd like staff to give a verbal report during Director's Report to let us know the major projects in the pipeline for 2009.

 Director's Announcements


 


Director Rahaim


-
 
 You will receive today the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan policy documents.
 
 We are proposing the plan for initiation next week.


-
 
 Secondly, the census report that Commissioner Antonini's mentioned: 
 
I understand that grew out of an interest in a market study for some part of the City.
 
 They discovered a couple of things about population in those areas.
 
 We are going to be working with the Mayor's Office of Community Development on that in figuring out what the reasonable count would be.


-
 
 Sea Wall Lot 337, just to let you know, there were originally four submissions that the advisory panel recommended and three of those go forward.
 
 I do not think there is any formal decision at this point.


-
 
 The pipeline projects report is being completed and we will be able to report on that in the next couple of weeks.

 This moratorium will allow additional study of the issue while Supervisor Sandoval considers permanent legislation.
 
 As an urgency ordinance, this item was not forwarded to the Commission for policy review.
 
 In the event that permanent controls are established, those would be heard by this Commission.
 
 
Passed
.


. Sponsored by Supervisor Peskin.
 
 On March 25
th
, Supervisor Peskin introduced an amended ordinance that focused solely on the Excelsior area.
 
 
Passed.


.
 
 This legislation would establish numerical criteria to establish when a demolition had occurred and establish processes for reviewing the loss of a dwelling unit either by a Conditional Use for loss of 3 or more units, or by a Discretionary Review for loss less than 3 units.


.
 
 This week the Committee considered amendments by the Board.
 
 Supervisors Peskin and Mirkarimi introduced amendments that would:
 
 (a) stipulate the participation of the Commission and Landmarks Board in further review of the project, (b) meet the criteria and apply to be certified as LEED project, (c) specifics on the amount of affordability, and (d) plan for UCSF to demonstrate within 5 years how they might relocate the dental school as well as changes to the amount of parking for the dental school.


.
 
 This week was the Plan's first read.
 
 It will need a second read next week and the Mayor's signature before it can begin the final 30-day wait to become effective.

– Discretionary Review.
 
 This was a nine unit building filed before amendments to the 315 Ordinance had been made in 2006. 
 
The Planning Commission did not require any inclusionary housing under the ordinance.
 
 
Two motions were made, first one for a monetary contribution towards affordable housing and the second to remove the fifth story of the building, and both failed.

-
 
 This project was very welcomed by the department from the beginning, and continued to be so until a week ago when the position of the department changed.


-
 
 The intent is to build an efficient environmentally friendly, green car wash using solar power and recycled water.


-
 
 Machinery [at the current site] is outdated and absolute. 
 
It is going to be shut down.


(-)Harry Thomas


-
 
 The project would increase traffic and noise.
 
 The chemicals would affect students from the elementary school close by as well as residents.


(-)Marc Glomb


-
 
 There are four garages with car wash in the neighborhood within four blocks.
 
 The proposed project would increase traffic and noise in a residential area.


(+)Tom Saberi, Project Sponsor




-
 
 
We purchased the building and started the process because we were told that the use was appropriate and that the City was supportive of it.

Denial would put our businesses, employees and their families in financial jeopardy.

th
 
and 24
th
 
Streets; Assessor's blocks 4090, 4140, 4154, and 4213. 
SFGH
 
proposes to revise the IMP currently on file with the Planning Department to reflect changes including the proposed design of a new acute care hospital, related campus master plan elements, and the replacement of existing emergency generators associated with the balance of the SFGH Campus.
 Pursuant to Planning Code Section 304.5(e), a public hearing is required to solicit public comment on any proposed revision to an Institutional Master Plan. The property is in a P (Public) Use District and a 105-E Height and Bulk District.


Preliminary Recommendation: No action is required. This hearing is for the purpose of receiving Commission and public comment only.


 


SPEAKER(S)


Jean O'Connell, San Francisco General Hospital

 This is targeted for completion in 2010. 
 
The Environmental Impact Report is still in planning and the draft should come out in the summer.

 [Presentation of the project showing sections staying in the old building and which sections are being relocated in the new building]


-
 
 The helipad for the hospital would be located on the old building.


Stephen Murray


-
 
 I urge you to be skeptical about the plans for the helipad being anywhere because there is no need for it.


Karen Cliffe


-
 
 There is no need for a helipad because San Francisco General is designated to be a trauma center for adults and pediatrics.


Richard Katz


Bridget O'Rourke


-
 
 I'm against the helipad at the hospital because it is unnecessary and even redundant because of the existing helipads in the Bay Area.

Loretta Lynch


Kat Podgornoff


Felario Salazar


Sue Hestor


Ezka


-
 
 Expressed support for the helipad and the hospital extension because noise is not as important as citizen's health.


Silvia Johnson


-
 
 There were not enough time to review the documents and the public tried to call and could not get answers.


Del Greger


-
 
 The helipad is intended for out of area patients and I questioned why that is appropriate for a city tax funded hospital and the need of it.


 


ACTION:
 
 Although no action is required from the Commission, from Commissioner's discussion, and particularly through the President, the IMP is accepted.

cute care services currently located in the existing Main Hospital (Building 5) would be relocated to the new hospital, and the vacated space in the existing Main Hospital would be reused for non-acute care medical and administrative uses. The SFGH Campus, including the proposed new hospital
 site, 
is in a P (Public) Use District and a 105-E Height and Bulk District.
 The proposed project would require a Conditional Use Authorization for a Planned Unit Development (PUD) addressing height measurement modification, bulk, and parking, among other approvals.


Preliminary Recommendation: No action is required. This hearing is for the purpose of receiving Commission and public comment only.

 This DEIR does not explain what is the standard or criteria imposed on the hospital to apply for variances on open space.


Richard Katz


Bridget O'Rourke


-
 
 More analysis is needed on all facts of the proposed construction phase into more details like how the asbestos is to be eliminated instead of mitigated.


Kat Podgornoff




-
 
 
It seems that a lot of scales do not match particularly with the noise level and that should be addressed.




Beth Brown


Del Greger


-
 
 There are some serious inadequacies in the analysis of alternative sites.
 
 For example, the lot adjacent to the current emergency department could be the site for the new building.


Michelle Schaul


-
 
 Concerned about traffic impacts with the existing very complicated busy intersection on 23

 and Potrero.


Loretta Lynan

 We are concerned with the inadequate data in the Institutional Master Plan and how it relates to the data in the DEIR.

Staff Initiated Discretionary Review
 of Building Permit Application number 2006.02.08.4114.
 
 The proposal is to construct a new mixed-use building containing 8 dwelling units with commercial space and 8 off-street parking spaces on the ground floor.
 
 The applicant requests that the Planning Commission remove the springing condition requiring community impact fees and BMR units that was previously imposed on the project.
 
 The subject property is located within the Valencia NCD (Neighborhood Commercial District) with a 50-X Height and Bulk designation.


Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and remove the springing condition.

SPEAKER(S)


David Silverman, Project Sponsor Representative

 This project was approved on April 19, 2007 and it was before this Commission on August 30. 
 
It was approved with Resolution 17482 when there were no rules set on how to handle projects in the Eastern Neighborhoods.


-
 
 We are here asking that you enforce your resolution 17481 and delete the springing conditions as recommended by staff.


(+)John O'connell


-
 
 This project should be exempt from the conditions because the Commission grandfathered application before the April 19, 2007 date.


(+)[No name stated]


-
 
 Mr. Mallia [project sponsor] was passive resistant to the conditions. 
 
He did not willingly accept them.


(+)Ron Mallia, Project Sponsor


(+)Gina


-
 
 Supported the removal of conditions to let the project go through.


Silvia Johnson


(-)Judie Ledbetter


-
 
 We would like to see the conditions and the below market units stay because it would set a really bad precedence otherwise.


(-)Sue Hestor

 The developer agreed to something on the project and whoever wanted to go through their project before the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan was done took a risk.


 


ACTION:
 
 Took Discretionary Review and approved the removal of the Springing Condition
