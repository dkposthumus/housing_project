 to allow dwellings at a density ratio exceeding one dwelling unit per 400 square feet of lot area within an RTO (Residential, Transit-Oriented Neighborhood) Zoning District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District. There are two existing six-unit residential buildings at the project site.

No physical expansion of the building is proposed. The existing buildings do not provide the usable open space required for the existing and proposed new dwelling units at the project site, therefore the Zoning Administrator will consider a request for a Variance from usable open space requirements concurrently with the Planning Commission's consideration of the conditional use authorization.


Preliminary recommendation: Approval with Conditions.

BALBOA PARK STATION AREA PLAN
 - 
Informational
 - The Balboa Park Station Area Plan
 
encompasses the entirety or portions of 43 Assessor's Blocks including those the parcels fronting Ocean Avenue between Manor Drive and San Jose Avenue, the Balboa Reservoir, City College of San Francisco's Ocean Avenue Campus, Balboa Park, the Balboa Park BART/MUNI station, and the MTA's Green Yard, Upper Yard, and Geneva Yard.
 


 


The Balboa Park Station Area Plan articulates a holistic vision for the area by promoting transit, and bicycle use and
 
 pedestrian friendly environments; by strengthening and encouraging vibrant neighborhood-serving commercial areas; by providing and maintaining community facilities and open space to ensure neighborhood livability; and by increasing both the supply and variety of housing for residents.
 
 The project requires several actions by the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors, including conforming amendments to the General Plan, Planning Code and Zoning Map.
 


 


Today's presentation will be informational: no action is required by the Planning Commission today.
 
 On Thursday, November 6
th
, Staff presented two of the three components of the Plan; the Area Plan and the Zoning Controls.
 
 Today, Staff will present the third component of the Balboa Park Station Area Plan; the Balboa Park Community Improvements Program.
 
 The Community Improvements Program addresses identified needs proposes specific funding strategies, and identifies potential funding sources to finance the projects identified in the Plan.
 
 The Balboa Park Community Improvements Program looks at existing, new, and future sources of revenue and proposes a fee for new development; the Balboa Park Impact Fee.
 
 The Program also establishes roles for city agencies to administer the Program, and it provides a monitoring program to ensure that implementation actions follow the intent of the Plan. This hearing is the second of the three hearings currently scheduled for the Plan.
