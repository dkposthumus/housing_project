UPPER MARKET COMMUNITY DESIGN PLAN
 
- 
The San Francisco Planning Department has published a document entitled  Upper Market Community Design Plan. 
 
 The plan area generally includes properties fronting Market Street between Octavia Boulevard on the east and Collingwood Street on the west.
 


 


Prior to initiating community workshops, the Department and its consultant team explored existing conditions in the neighborhood.
 
 The Department conducted outreach meetings with representatives of the Castro and nearby neighborhood organizations.
 
 The Department held three community workshops.
 
 The themes of the workshops focused on: 1.) Community Vision (September 2007); 2.) Community Design Framework (October 2007); and 3.) Design Strategies (December 2007).
 
 The outcome of the workshops is a Design Plan that contains a program for public realm improvements and design guidelines for private development that incorporate the identity, character, economic and social composition of the Upper Market area and its surrounding neighborhoods.


 


The Plan responds to physical, social, and economic conditions in the Project area, and establishes a plan for public and private improvements in the Project Area.
 
 The Plan identifies existing physical, infrastructure and economic conditions in the Upper Market neighborhood, considers historical context and identifies key neighborhood assets, challenges and opportunities to revitalize the neighborhood.
 
 It includes an Urban Design Framework section that: describes planning strategies that may be used to guide Urban Design improvements along the upper Market Street corridor.
 
 The Plan also proposes improvements to the public realm, including public spaces, sidewalks, and plazas.
 


 


The Plan incorporates Design Guidelines that may be used to guide design character for new buildings, and provides an overview of the steps that may be taken to achieve neighborhood improvements. The Upper Market Community Design Plan:


 




Identifies the community's five highest priority public infrastructure improvement projects,


Actions that neighborhood residents, business owners and community organizations may take to support improvements, and


Outlines design guidelines that may be used by both developers and city planners


The Plan also identifies potential funding sources for street and sidewalk improvements. "
