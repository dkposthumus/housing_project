SPEAKERS: 
Georgia Schuttish – March 2009 Staff recommended returning w/n the year to adjust 
Demo Calcs as Commission has legislative authority to do per Section 317 (b) (2) (D). 
June 2019 I submitted handout showing adjustment at full 20% over several years. 
Now March 2025, six years after 2019 handout, 16 years after Staff recommendation. 
“Year Two” is the sweet spot. Compare Demo Calcs Matrix for project at 1910 Baker 
with “Year Two” adjustment would mean that project is Demolition not “major 
Alteration” —- officially. Even true with “Year One” adjustment. Commonsense: Look 
at 1910 Baker photos/Demo Calcs show it to be deFacto/Tantamount to Demolition.

Calcs should be adjusted to effectively preserve housing. Look at sales price since 2014. 
Additionally —— Residential Flat Policy needs to be codified per Housing Element 
Action Item 8.3.2 guaranteeing preservation of existing housing, unit equity, 
preventing loss of rent controlled/relatively affordable housing for City in future.
