Sponsor: Walton. Staff: Starr \nThis week, the land use committee considered a duplicated version on the 2024 Code Corrections \nOrdinance, that was sponsored by this commission. The Code corrections ordinance was duplicated by \nSupervisor Peskin in December of last year with the intention of amending the PDR-2 controls.  \nThe amendment applies to only one site. When the City was considering stricter controls on self-storage \nfacilities, this site had a pending application. A carve-out allowed the self-storage facility to proceed, \nprovided that 50% of the site was used for specific purposes like Industrial, Agricultural, Automotive Repair, \nCatering, Trade Shop, Institutional Community use, or Arts Activities. The proposed amendment expands \nthe allowable uses for that 50% portion to include any use permitted in the PDR-2 zoning district\u2014except \nParcel Delivery Service and Fleet Charging \nCommissioners, you heard the 2024 Code Corrections ordinance on September 19 of last year and voted to \nrecommend approval with some additional code correction modifications. In addition, you also endorsed \nthe Land Use Committee adding this provision to the code if they saw fit. You did not actively add it to the \nordinances, as it was a last-minute request from the interested parties.  \nThe duplicated file has since been sponsored by Supervisor Walton. At Monday\u2019s hearing, Supervisor Walton \nwas not present, but planning staff read the amendments into the record, and committee member \nSupervisor Chen made a motion to adopt the amendments. The vote to adopt the amendments and to \ncontinue the item for one week both passed unanimously.   \nFull Board \n250069 Planning Code - Conversion of Residential Hotel Rooms to Tourist Hotel Rooms at 447 Bush Street. \nSponsor: City Attorney.
